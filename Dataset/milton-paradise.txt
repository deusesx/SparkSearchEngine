when they see law can discov sin  but not remov  save by those shadowi expiat weak  the blood of bull and goat  they may conclud some blood more precious must be paid for man  just for unjust  that  in such righteous to them by faith imput  they may find justif toward god  and peac of conscienc  which the law by ceremoni cannot appeas  nor man the mortal part perform  and  not perform  cannot

teach  for  from that day  not onli to the son of abraham  s loin salvat shall be preach  but to the son of abraham  s faith wherev through the world  so in his seed all nation shall be blest  then to

confound leav  then enter into glori  and resum his seat at god  s right hand  exalt high abov all name in heaven  and thenc shall come  when this world  s dissolut shall be ripe  with glori and power to judg both quick and dead  to judg the unfaith dead  but to reward his faith  and receiv them into bliss  whether in heaven or earth  for then the earth shall all be paradis  far happier place than this of eden  and far happier day  so spake the arch  angel michael  then paus  as at the world  s great period  and our sire  replet with joy and wonder  thus repli  o good infinit  good immens  that all this good of evil shall produc  and evil turn to good  more wonder than that which by creation first brought forth light out of dark  full of doubt i stand  whether i should repent me now of sin by me done  and occas  or rejoic much more  that much more good thereof shall spring  to god more glori  more good  will to men from god  and over wrath grace shall abound  but say  if our deliver up to heaven must re  ascend  what will betid the few his faith  left among the unfaith herd  the enemi of truth  who then shall guid his peopl  who defend  will they not deal wors with his follow than with him they dealt  be sure they will  said the angel  but from heaven he to his own a comfort will send  the promis of the father  who shall dwell his spirit within them  and the law of faith  work through love  upon their heart shall write  to guid them in all truth  and also arm with spiritu armour  abl to resist satan  s assault  and quench his fieri dart  what man can do against them  not afraid  though to the death  against such cruelti with inward consol recompens  and oft support so as shall amaz their proudest persecutor  for the spirit  pour first on his apostl  whom he send to evangel the nation  then on all baptiz  shall them with wonder gift endu to speak all tongu  and do all miracl  as did their lord befor them  thus they win great number of each nation to receiv with joy the tide brought from heaven  at length their ministri perform  and race well run  their doctrin and their stori written left  they die  but in their room  as they forewarn  wolv shall succeed for
