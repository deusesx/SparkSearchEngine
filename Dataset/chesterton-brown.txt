 the wisdom of father brown by g  k  chesterton 1914  i  the absenc of mr glass the consult  room of dr orion hood  the emin criminologist and specialist in certain moral disord  lay along the sea  front at scarborough  in a seri of veri larg and well  light french window  which show the north sea like one endless outer wall of blue  green marbl  in such a place the sea had someth of the monotoni of a blue  green dado  for the chamber themselv were rule throughout by a terribl tidi not unlik the terribl tidi of the sea  it must not be suppos that dr hood  s apart exclud luxuri  or even poetri  these thing were there  in their place  but one felt that they were never allow out of their place  luxuri was there  there stood upon a special tabl eight or ten box of the best cigar  but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were alway nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window  a tantalus contain three kind of spirit  all of a liqueur excel  stood alway on this tabl of luxuri  but the fanci have assert that the whiski  brandi  and rum seem alway to stand at the same level  poetri was there  the left  hand corner of the room was line with as complet a set of english classic as the right hand could show of english and foreign physiologist  but if one took a volum of chaucer or shelley from that rank  it absenc irrit the mind like a gap in a man  s front teeth  one could not say the book were never read  probabl they were  but there was a sens of their be chain to their place  like the bibl in the old church  dr hood treat his privat book  shelf as if it were a public librari  and if this strict scientif intang steep even the shelv laden with lyric and ballad and the tabl laden with drink and tobacco  it goe without say that yet more of such heathen holi protect the other shelv that held the specialist  s librari  and the other tabl that sustain the frail and even fairylik instrument of chemistri or mechan  dr hood pace the length of his string of apart  bound  as the boy  geographi say  on the east by the north sea and on the west by the serri rank of his sociolog and criminologist librari  he was clad in an artist  s velvet  but with none of an artist  s neglig  his hair was heavili shot with grey  but grow thick and healthi  his face was lean  but sanguin and expect  everyth about him and his room indic someth at onc rigid and restless  like that great northern sea by which  on pure principl of hygien  he had built his home  fate  be in a funni mood  push the door open and introduc into those long  strict  sea  flank apart one who was perhap the most startl opposit of them and their master  in answer to a curt but civil summon  the door open inward and there shambl into the room a shapeless littl figur  which seem to find it own hat and umbrella as unmanag as a mass of luggag  the umbrella was a black and prosaic bundl long past repair  the hat was a broad  curv black hat  cleric but not common in england  the man was the veri embodi of all that is home and helpless  the doctor regard the new  comer with a restrain astonish  not unlik that he would have shown if some huge but obvious harmless sea  beast had crawl into his room  the new  comer regard the doctor with that beam but breathless genial which character a corpul charwoman who has just manag to stuff herself into an omnibus  it is a rich confus of social self  congratul and bodili disarray  his hat tumbl to the carpet  his heavi umbrella slip between his knee with a thud  he reach after the one and duck after the other  but with an unimpair smile on his round face spoke simultan as follow   my name is brown  pray excus me  i  ve come about that busi of the macnab  i have heard  you often help peopl out of such troubl  pray excus me if i am wrong  by this time he had sprawl recov the hat  and made an odd littl bob bow over it  as if set everyth quit right   i hard understand you  repli the scientist  with a cold intens of manner   i fear you have mistaken the chamber  i am dr hood  and my work is almost entir literari and educ  it is true that i have sometim been consult by the polic in case of peculiar difficulti and import  but   oh  this is of the greatest import  broke in the littl man call brown   whi  her mother won  t let them get engag  and he lean back in his chair in radiant ration  the brow of dr hood were drawn down dark  but the eye under them were bright with someth that might be anger or might be amus   and still  he said   i do not quit understand   you see  they want to get marri  said the man with the cleric hat   maggi macnab and young todhunt want to get marri  now  what can be more import than that  the great orion hood  s scientif triumph had depriv him of mani thing  some said of his health  other of his god  but they had not wholli despoil him of his sens of the absurd  at the last plea of the ingenu priest a chuckl broke out of him from insid  and he threw himself into an arm  chair in an iron attitud of the consult physician   mr brown  he said grave   it is quit fourteen and a half year sinc i was person ask to test a person problem  then it was the case of an attempt to poison the french presid at a lord mayor  s banquet  it is now  i understand  a question of whether some friend of your call maggi is a suitabl fiance for some friend of her call todhunt  well  mr brown  i am a sportsman  i will take it on  i will give the macnab famili my best advic  as good as i gave the french republ and the king of england  no  better  fourteen year better  i have noth els to do this afternoon  tell me your stori  the littl clergyman call brown thank him with unquestion warmth  but still with a queer kind of simplic  it was rather as if he were thank a stranger in a smoke  room for some troubl in pass the match  than as if he were  as he was  practic thank the curat of kew garden for come with him into a field to find a four  leav clover  with scarc a semi  colon after his hearti thank  the littl man began his recit   i told you my name was brown  well  that  s the fact  and i  m the priest of the littl cathol church i dare say you  ve seen beyond those stragg street  where the town end toward the north  in the last and straggliest of those street which run along the sea like a sea  wall there is a veri honest but rather sharp  temper member of my flock  a widow call macnab  she has one daughter  and she let lodg  and between her and the daughter  and between her and the lodger  well  i dare say there is a great deal to be said on both side  at present she has onli one lodger  the young man call todhunt  but he has given more troubl than all the rest  for he want to marri the young woman of the hous   and the young woman of the hous  ask dr hood  with huge and silent amus   what doe she want   whi  she want to marri him  cri father brown  sit up eager   that is just the aw complic   it is inde a hideous enigma  said dr hood   this young jame todhunt  continu the cleric   is a veri decent man so far as i know  but then nobodi know veri much  he is a bright  brownish littl fellow  agil like a monkey  clean  shaven like an actor  and oblig like a born courtier  he seem to have quit a pocket of money  but nobodi know what his trade is  mrs macnab  therefor  be of a pessimist turn  is quit sure it is someth dread  and probabl connect with dynamit  the dynamit must be of a shi and noiseless sort  for the poor fellow onli shut himself up for sever hour of the day and studi someth behind a lock door  he declar his privaci is temporari and justifi  and promis to explain befor the wed  that is all that anyon know for certain  but mrs macnab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of  you know how the tale grow like grass on such a patch of ignor as that  there are tale of two voic heard talk in the room  though  when the door is open  todhunt is alway found alon  there are tale of a mysteri tall man in a silk hat  who onc came out of the sea  mist and appar out of the sea  step soft across the sandi field and through the small back garden at twilight  till he was heard talk to the lodger at his open window  the colloquy seem to end in a quarrel  todhunt dash down his window with violenc  and the man in the high hat melt into the sea  fog again  this stori is told by the famili with the fiercest mystif  but i realli think mrs macnab prefer her own origin tale  that the other man  or whatev it is  crawl out everi night from the big box in the corner  which is kept lock all day  you see  therefor  how this seal door of todhunt  s is treat as the gate of all the fanci and monstros of the  thousand and one night  and yet there is the littl fellow in his respect black jacket  as punctual and innoc as a parlour clock  he pay his rent to the tick  he is practic a teetotal  he is tireless kind with the younger children  and can keep them amus for a day on end  and  last and most urgent of all  he has made himself equal popular with the eldest daughter  who is readi to go to church with him tomorrow  a man warm concern with ani larg theori has alway a relish for appli them to ani trivial  the great specialist have condescend to the priest  s simplic  condescend expans  he settl himself with comfort in his arm  chair and began to talk in the tone of a somewhat absent  mind lectur   even in a minut instanc  it is best to look first to the main tendenc of natur  a particular flower may not be dead in earli winter  but the flower are die  a particular pebbl may never be wet with the tide  but the tide is come in  to the scientif eye all human histori is a seri of collect movement  destruct or migrat  like the massacr of fli in winter or the return of bird in spring  now the root fact in all histori is race  race produc religion  race produc legal and ethic war  there is no stronger case than that of the wild  unworld and perish stock which we common call the celt  of whom your friend the macnab are specimen  small  swarthi  and of this dreami and drift blood  they accept easili the superstiti explan of ani incid  just as they still accept  you will excus me for say  that superstiti explan of all incid which you and your church repres  it is not remark that such peopl  with the sea moan behind them and the church  excus me again  drone in front of them  should put fantast featur into what are probabl plain event  you  with your small parochi respons  see onli this particular mrs macnab  terrifi with this particular tale of two voic and a tall man out of the sea  but the man with the scientif imagin see  as it were  the whole clan of macnab scatter over the whole world  in it ultim averag as uniform as a tribe of bird  he see thousand of mrs macnab  in thousand of hous  drop their littl drop of morbid in the tea  cup of their friend  he see  befor the scientist could conclud his sentenc  anoth and more impati summon sound from without  someon with swish skirt was marshal hurri down the corridor  and the door open on a young girl  decent dress but disord and red  hot with hast  she had sea  blown blond hair  and would have been entir beauti if her cheek  bone had not been  in the scotch manner  a littl high in relief as well as in colour  her apolog was almost as abrupt as a command   i  m sorri to interrupt you  sir  she said   but i had to follow father brown at onc  it  s noth less than life or death  father brown began to get to his feet in some disord   whi  what has happen  maggi  he said   jame has been murder  for all i can make out  answer the girl  still breath hard from her rush   that man glass has been with him again  i heard them talk through the door quit plain  two separ voic  for jame speak low  with a burr  and the other voic was high and quaveri   that man glass  repeat the priest in some perplex   i know his name is glass  answer the girl  in great impati   i heard it through the door  they were quarrel  about money  i think  for i heard jame say again and again   that  s right  mr glass  or  no  mr glass  and then   two or three  mr glass  but we  re talk too much  you must come at onc  and there may be time yet   but time for what  ask dr hood  who had been studi the young ladi with mark interest   what is there about mr glass and his money troubl that should impel such urgenc   i tri to break down the door and couldn  t  answer the girl short   then i ran to the back  yard  and manag to climb on to the window  sill that look into the room  it was an dim  and seem to be empti  but i swear i saw jame lie huddl up in a corner  as if he were drug or strangl   this is veri serious  said father brown  gather his errant hat and umbrella and stand up   in point of fact i was just put your case befor this gentleman  and his view   has been larg alter  said the scientist grave   i do not think this young ladi is so celtic as i had suppos  as i have noth els to do  i will put on my hat and stroll down town with you  in a few minut all three were approach the dreari tail of the macnab  street  the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the mountain  the criminologist with a loung grace  which was not without a certain leopard  like swift  and the priest at an energet trot entir devoid of distinct  the aspect of this edg of the town was not entir without justif for the doctor  s hint about desol mood and environ  the scatter hous stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashor  the afternoon was close with a prematur and part lurid twilight  the sea was of an inki purpl and murmur omin  in the scrappi back garden of the macnab which ran down toward the sand  two black  barren  look tree stood up like demon hand held up in astonish  and as mrs macnab ran down the street to meet them with lean hand similar spread  and her fierc face in shadow  she was a littl like a demon herself  the doctor and the priest made scant repli to her shrill reiter of her daughter  s stori  with more disturb detail of her own  to the divid vow of vengeanc against mr glass for murder  and against mr todhunt for be murder  or against the latter for have dare to want to marri her daughter  and for not have live to do it  they pass through the narrow passag in the front of the hous until they came to the lodger  s door at the back  and there dr hood  with the trick of an old detect  put his shoulder sharpli to the panel and burst in the door  it open on a scene of silent catastroph  no one see it  even for a flash  could doubt that the room had been the theatr of some thrill collis between two  or perhap more  person  play  card lay litter across the tabl or flutter about the floor as if a game had been interrupt  two wine glass stood readi for wine on a side  tabl  but a third lay smash in a star of crystal upon the carpet  a few feet from it lay what look like a long knife or short sword  straight  but with an ornament and pictur handl  it dull blade just caught a grey glint from the dreari window behind  which show the black tree against the leaden level of the sea  toward the opposit corner of the room was roll a gentleman  s silk top hat  as if it had just been knock off his head  so much so  inde  that one almost look to see it still roll  and in the corner behind it  thrown like a sack of potato  but cord like a railway trunk  lay mr jame todhunt  with a scarf across his mouth  and six or seven rope knot round his elbow and ankl  his brown eye were aliv and shift alert  dr orion hood paus for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violenc  then he step swift across the carpet  pick up the tall silk hat  and grave put it upon the head of the yet pinion todhunt  it was so much too larg for him that it almost slip down on to his shoulder   mr glass  s hat  said the doctor  return with it and peer into the insid with a pocket len   how to explain the absenc of mr glass and the presenc of mr glass  s hat  for mr glass is not a careless man with his cloth  that hat is of a stylish shape and systemat brush and burnish  though not veri new  an old dandi  i should think   but  good heaven  call out miss macnab   aren  t you go to unti the man first   i say  old  with intent  though not with certainti  continu the expositor   my reason for it might seem a littl far  fetch  the hair of human be fall out in veri vari degre  but almost alway fall out slight  and with the len i should see the tini hair in a hat recent worn  it has none  which lead me to guess that mr glass is bald  now when this is taken with the high  pitch and querul voic which miss macnab describ so vivid  patienc  my dear ladi  patienc  when we take the hairless head togeth with the tone common in senil anger  i should think we may deduc some advanc in year  nevertheless  he was probabl vigor  and he was almost certain tall  i might reli in some degre on the stori of his previous appear at the window  as a tall man in a silk hat  but i think i have more exact indic  this wineglass has been smash all over the place  but one of it splinter lie on the high bracket besid the mantelpiec  no such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smash in the hand of a compar short man like mr todhunt   by the way  said father brown   might it not be as well to unti mr todhunt   our lesson from the drink  vessel doe not end here  proceed the specialist   i may say at onc that it is possibl that the man glass was bald or nervous through dissip rather than age  mr todhunt  as has been remark  is a quiet thrifti gentleman  essenti an abstain  these card and wine  cup are no part of his normal habit  they have been produc for a particular companion  but  as it happen  we may go farther  mr todhunt may or may not possess this wine  servic  but there is no appear of his possess ani wine  what  then  were these vessel to contain  i would at onc suggest some brandi or whiski  perhap of a luxuri sort  from a flask in the pocket of mr glass  we have thus someth like a pictur of the man  or at least of the type  tall  elder  fashion  but somewhat fray  certain fond of play and strong water  perhap rather too fond of them mr glass is a gentleman not unknown on the fring of societi   look here  cri the young woman   if you don  t let me pass to unti him i  ll run outsid and scream for the polic   i should not advis you  miss macnab  said dr hood grave   to be in ani hurri to fetch the polic  father brown  i serious ask you to compos your flock  for their sake  not for mine  well  we have seen someth of the figur and qualiti of mr glass  what are the chief fact known of mr todhunt  they are substanti three  that he is econom  that he is more or less wealthi  and that he has a secret  now  sure it is obvious that there are the three chief mark of the kind of man who is blackmail  and sure it is equal obvious that the fade fineri  the proflig habit  and the shrill irrit of mr glass are the unmistak mark of the kind of man who blackmail him  we have the two typic figur of a tragedi of hush money  on the one hand  the respect man with a mysteri  on the other  the west  end vultur with a scent for a mysteri  these two men have met here today and have quarrel  use blow and a bare weapon   are you go to take those rope off  ask the girl stubborn  dr hood replac the silk hat care on the side tabl  and went across to the captiv  he studi him intent  even move him a littl and half  turn him round by the shoulder  but he onli answer   no  i think these rope will do veri well till your friend the polic bring the handcuff  father brown  who had been look dulli at the carpet  lift his round face and said   what do you mean  the man of scienc had pick up the peculiar dagger  sword from the carpet and was examin it intent as he answer   becaus you find mr todhunt tie up  he said   you all jump to the conclus that mr glass had tie him up  and then  i suppos  escap  there are four object to this  first  whi should a gentleman so dressi as our friend glass leav his hat behind him  if he left of his own free will  second  he continu  move toward the window   this is the onli exit  and it is lock on the insid  third  this blade here has a tini touch of blood at the point  but there is no wound on mr todhunt  mr glass took that wound away with him  dead or aliv  add to all this primari probabl  it is much more like that the blackmail person would tri to kill his incubus  rather than that the blackmail would tri to kill the goos that lay his golden egg  there  i think  we have a pretti complet stori   but the rope  inquir the priest  whose eye had remain open with a rather vacant admir   ah  the rope  said the expert with a singular inton   miss macnab veri much want to know whi i did not set mr todhunt free from his rope  well  i will tell her  i did not do it becaus mr todhunt can set himself free from them at ani minut he choos   what  cri the audienc on quit differ note of astonish   i have look at all the knot on mr todhunt  reiter hood quiet   i happen to know someth about knot  they are quit a branch of crimin scienc  everi one of those knot he has made himself and could loosen himself  not one of them would have been made by an enemi realli tri to pinion him  the whole of this affair of the rope is a clever fake  to make us think him the victim of the struggl instead of the wretch glass  whose corps may be hidden in the garden or stuf up the chimney  there was a rather depress silenc  the room was darken  the sea  blight bough of the garden tree look leaner and blacker than ever  yet they seem to have come nearer to the window  one could almost fanci they were sea  monster like kraken or cuttlefish  writh polypi who had crawl up from the sea to see the end of this tragedi  even as he  the villain and victim of it  the terribl man in the tall hat  had onc crawl up from the sea  for the whole air was dens with the morbid of blackmail  which is the most morbid of human thing  becaus it is a crime conceal a crime  a black plaster on a blacker wound  the face of the littl cathol priest  which was common complac and even comic  had sudden becom knot with a curious frown  it was not the blank curios of his first innoc  it was rather that creativ curios which come when a man has the begin of an idea   say it again  pleas  he said in a simpl  bother manner   do you mean that todhunt can tie himself up all alon and unti himself all alon   that is what i mean  said the doctor   jerusalem  ejacul brown sudden   i wonder if it could possibl be that  he scuttl across the room rather like a rabbit  and peer with quit a new impuls into the partial  cover face of the captiv  then he turn his own rather fatuous face to the compani   yes  that  s it  he cri in a certain excit   can  t you see it in the man  s face  whi  look at his eye  both the professor and the girl follow the direct of his glanc  and though the broad black scarf complet mask the lower half of todhunt  s visag  they did grow conscious of someth struggl and intens about the upper part of it   his eye do look queer  cri the young woman  strong move   you brute  i believ it  s hurt him   not that  i think  said dr hood   the eye have certain a singular express  but i should interpret those transvers wrinkl as express rather such slight psycholog abnorm   oh  bosh  cri father brown   can  t you see he  s laugh   laugh  repeat the doctor  with a start   but what on earth can he be laugh at   well  repli the reverend brown apologet   not to put too fine a point on it  i think he is laugh at you  and inde  i  m a littl inclin to laugh at myself  now i know about it   now you know about what  ask hood  in some exasper   now i know  repli the priest   the profess of mr todhunt  he shuffl about the room  look at one object after anoth with what seem to be a vacant stare  and then invari burst into an equal vacant laugh  a high irrit process for those who had to watch it  he laugh veri much over the hat  still more uproari over the broken glass  but the blood on the sword point sent him into mortal convuls of amus  then he turn to the fume specialist   dr hood  he cri enthusiast   you are a great poet  you have call an uncreat be out of the void  how much more godlik that is than if you had onli ferret out the mere fact  inde  the mere fact are rather commonplac and comic by comparison   i have no notion what you are talk about  said dr hood rather haughtili   my fact are all inevit  though necessarili incomplet  a place may be permit to intuit  perhap  or poetri if you prefer the term  but onli becaus the correspond detail cannot as yet be ascertain  in the absenc of mr glass   that  s it  that  s it  said the littl priest  nod quit eager   that  s the first idea to get fix  the absenc of mr glass  he is so extrem absent  i suppos  he ad reflect   that there was never anybodi so absent as mr glass   do you mean he is absent from the town  demand the doctor   i mean he is absent from everywher  answer father brown   he is absent from the natur of thing  so to speak   do you serious mean  said the specialist with a smile   that there is no such person  the priest made a sign of assent   it doe seem a piti  he said  orion hood broke into a contemptu laugh   well  he said   befor we go on to the hundr and one other evid  let us take the first proof we found  the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room  if there is no mr glass  whose hat is this   it is mr todhunt  s  repli father brown   but it doesn  t fit him  cri hood impati   he couldn  t possibl wear it  father brown shook his head with ineff mild   i never said he could wear it  he answer   i said it was his hat  or  if you insist on a shade of differ  a hat that is his   and what is the shade of differ  ask the criminologist with a slight sneer   my good sir  cri the mild littl man  with his first movement akin to impati   if you will walk down the street to the nearest hatter  s shop  you will see that there is  in common speech  a differ between a man  s hat and the hat that are his   but a hatter  protest hood   can get money out of his stock of new hat  what could todhunt get out of this one old hat   rabbit  repli father brown prompt   what  cri dr hood   rabbit  ribbon  sweetmeat  goldfish  roll of colour paper  said the reverend gentleman with rapid   didn  t you see it all when you found out the fake rope  it  s just the same with the sword  mr todhunt hasn  t got a scratch on him  as you say  but he  s got a scratch in him  if you follow me   do you mean insid mr todhunt  s cloth  inquir mrs macnab stern   i do not mean insid mr todhunt  s cloth  said father brown   i mean insid mr todhunt   well  what in the name of bedlam do you mean   mr todhunt  explain father brown placid   is learn to be a profession conjur  as well as juggler  ventriloquist  and expert in the rope trick  the conjur explain the hat  it is without trace of hair  not becaus it is worn by the prematur bald mr glass  but becaus it has never been worn by anybodi  the juggl explain the three glass  which todhunt was teach himself to throw up and catch in rotat  but  be onli at the stage of practic  he smash one glass against the ceil  and the juggl also explain the sword  which it was mr todhunt  s profession pride and duti to swallow  but  again  be at the stage of practic  he veri slight graze the insid of his throat with the weapon  henc he has a wound insid him  which i am sure  from the express on his face  is not a serious one  he was also practis the trick of a releas from rope  like the davenport brother  and he was just about to free himself when we all burst into the room  the card  of cours  are for card trick  and they are scatter on the floor becaus he had just been practis one of those dodg of send them fli through the air  he mere kept his trade secret  becaus he had to keep his trick secret  like ani other conjur  but the mere fact of an idler in a top hat have onc look in at his back window  and been driven away by him with great indign  was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romanc  and make us imagin his whole life overshadow by the silk  hat spectr of mr glass   but what about the two voic  ask maggi  stare   have you never heard a ventriloquist  ask father brown   don  t you know they speak first in their natur voic  and then answer themselv in just that shrill  squeaki  unnatur voic that you heard  there was a long silenc  and dr hood regard the littl man who had spoken with a dark and attent smile   you are certain a veri ingeni person  he said   it could not have been done better in a book  but there is just one part of mr glass you have not succeed in explain away  and that is his name  miss macnab distinct heard him so address by mr todhunt  the rev  mr brown broke into a rather childish giggl   well  that  he said   that  s the silliest part of the whole silli stori  when our juggl friend here threw up the three glass in turn  he count them aloud as he caught them  and also comment aloud when he fail to catch them  what he realli said was   one  two and three  miss a glass one  two  miss a glass  and so on  there was a second of still in the room  and then everyon with one accord burst out laugh  as they did so the figur in the corner complac uncoil all the rope and let them fall with a flourish  then  advanc into the middl of the room with a bow  he produc from his pocket a big bill print in blue and red  which announc that zaladin  the world  s greatest conjur  contortionist  ventriloquist and human kangaroo would be readi with an entir new seri of trick at the empir pavilion  scarborough  on

corner  but muscari  an ardent cathol  took no more notic of them than of a coupl of crow  but from a yet farther seat  part conceal behind a dwarf tree golden with orang  there rose and advanc toward the poet a person whose costum was the most aggress opposit to his own  this figur was clad in tweed of a piebald check  with a pink tie  a sharp collar and protuber yellow boot  he contriv  in the true tradit of  arri at margat  to look at onc startl and commonplac  but as the cockney apparit drew nearer  muscari was astound to observ that the head was distinct differ from the bodi  it was an italian head  fuzzi  swarthi and veri vivaci  that rose abrupt out of the stand collar like cardboard and the comic pink tie  in fact it was a head he knew  he recogn it  abov all the dire erect of english holiday array  as the face of an old but forgotten friend name ezza  this youth had been a prodigi at colleg  and european fame was promis him when he was bare fifteen  but when he appear in the world he fail  first public as a dramatist and a demagogu  and then privat for year on end as an actor  a travel  a commiss agent or a journalist  muscari had known him last behind the footlight  he was but too well attun to the excit of that profess  and it was believ that some moral calam had swallow him up   ezza  cri the poet  rise and shake hand in a pleasant astonish   well  i  ve seen you in mani costum in the green room  but i never expect to see you dress up as an englishman   this  answer ezza grave   is not the costum of an englishman  but of the italian of the futur   in that case  remark muscari   i confess i prefer the italian of the past   that is your old mistak  muscari  said the man in tweed  shake his head   and the mistak of itali  in the sixteenth centuri we tuscan made the morn  we had the newest steel  the newest carv  the newest chemistri  whi should we not now have the newest factori  the newest motor  the newest financ  the newest cloth   becaus they are not worth have  answer muscari   you cannot make italian realli progress  they are too intellig  men who see the short cut to good live will never go by the new elabor road   well  to me marconi  or d  annunzio  is the star of itali  said the other   that is whi i have becom a futurist  and a courier   a courier  cri muscari  laugh   is that the last of your list of trade  and whom are you conduct   oh  a man of the name of harrog  and his famili  i believ   not the banker in this hotel  inquir the poet  with some eager   that  s the man  answer the courier   doe it pay well  ask the troubadour innoc   it will pay me  said ezza  with a veri enigmat smile   but i am a rather curious sort of courier  then  as if chang the subject  he said abrupt   he has a daughter  and a son   the daughter is divin  affirm muscari   the father and son are  i suppos  human  but grant his harmless qualiti doesn  t that banker strike you as a splendid instanc of my argument  harrog has million in his safe  and i have  the hole in my pocket  but you daren  t say  you can  t say  that he  s clever than i  or bolder than i  or even more energet  he  s not clever  he  s got eye like blue button  he  s not energet  he move from chair to chair like a paralyt  he  s a conscienti  kind old blockhead  but he  s got money simpli becaus he collect money  as a boy collect stamp  you  re too strong  mind for busi  ezza  you won  t get on  to be clever enough to get all that money  one must be stupid enough to want it   i  m stupid enough for that  said ezza gloomili   but i should suggest a suspens of your critiqu of the banker  for here he come  mr harrog  the great financi  did inde enter the room  but nobodi look at him  he was a massiv elder man with a boil blue eye and fade grey  sandi moustach  but for his heavi stoop he might have been a colonel  he carri sever unopen letter in his hand  his son frank was a realli fine lad  cur  hair  sun  burnt and strenuous  but nobodi look at him either  all eye  as usual  were rivet  for the moment at least  upon ethel harrog  whose golden greek head and colour of the dawn seem set purpos abov that sapphir sea  like a goddess  s  the poet muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drink someth  as inde he was  he was drink the classic  which his father made  ezza studi her with a gaze equal intens and far more baffl  miss harrog was special radiant and readi for convers on this occas  and her famili had fallen into the easier continent habit  allow the stranger muscari and even the courier ezza to share their tabl and their talk  in ethel harrog convent crown itself with a perfect and splendour of it own  proud of her father  s prosper  fond of fashion pleasur  a fond daughter but an arrant flirt  she was all these thing with a sort of golden good  natur that made her veri pride pleas and her world respect a fresh and hearti thing  they were in an eddi of excit about some alleg peril in the mountain path they were to attempt that week  the danger was not from rock and avalanch  but from someth yet more romant  ethel had been earnest assur that brigand  the true cut  throat of the modern legend  still haunt that ridg and held that pass of the apennin   they say  she cri  with the aw relish of a schoolgirl   that all that countri isn  t rule by the king of itali  but by the king of thiev  who is the king of thiev   a great man  repli muscari   worthi to rank with your own robin hood  signorina  montano  the king of thiev  was first heard of in the mountain some ten year ago  when peopl said brigand were extinct  but his wild author spread with the swift of a silent revolut  men found his fierc proclam nail in everi mountain villag  his sentinel  gun in hand  in everi mountain ravin  six time the italian govern tri to dislodg him  and was defeat in six pitch battl as if by napoleon   now that sort of thing  observ the banker weightili   would never be allow in england  perhap  after all  we had better choos anoth rout  but the courier thought it perfect safe   it is perfect safe  said the courier contemptu   i have been over it twenti time  there may have been some old jailbird call a king in the time of our grandmoth  but he belong to histori if not to fabl  brigandag is utter stamp out   it can never be utter stamp out  muscari answer   becaus arm revolt is a recreat natur to southern  our peasant are like their mountain  rich in grace and green gaieti  but with the fire beneath  there is a point of human despair where the northern poor take to drink  and our own poor take to dagger   a poet is privileg  repli ezza  with a sneer   if signor muscari were english be would still be look for highwaymen in wandsworth  believ me  there is no more danger of be captur in itali than of be scalp in boston   then you propos to attempt it  ask mr harrog  frown   oh  it sound rather dread  cri the girl  turn her glorious eye on muscari   do you realli think the pass is danger  muscari threw back his black mane   i know it is danger  he said   i am cross it tomorrow  the young harrog was left behind for a moment empti a glass of white wine and light a cigarett  as the beauti retir with the banker  the courier and the poet  distribut peal of silveri satir  at about the same instant the two priest in the corner rose  the taller  a white  hair italian  take his leav  the shorter priest turn and walk toward the banker  s son  and the latter was astonish to realiz that though a roman priest the man was an englishman  he vagu rememb meet him at the social crush of some of his cathol friend  but the man spoke befor his memori could collect themselv   mr frank harrog  i think  he said   i have had an introduct  but i do not mean to presum on it  the odd thing i have to say will come far better from a stranger  mr harrog  i say one word and go  take care of your sister in her great sorrow  even for frank  s truli fratern indiffer the radianc and deris of his sister still seem to sparkl and ring  he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel  and he stare at his sombr advis in puzzledom   do you mean the brigand  he ask  and then  rememb a vagu fear of his own   or can you be think of muscari   one is never think of the real sorrow  said the strang priest   one can onli be kind when it come  and he pass prompt from the room  leav the other almost with his mouth open  a day or two afterward a coach contain the compani was realli crawl and stagger up the spur of the menac mountain rang  between ezza  s cheeri denial of the danger and muscari  s boister defianc of it  the financi famili were firm in their origin purpos  and muscari made his mountain journey coincid with their  a more surpris featur was the appear at the coast  town station of the littl priest of the restaur  he alleg mere that busi led him also to cross the mountain of the midland  but young harrog could not but connect his presenc with the mystic fear and warn of yesterday  the coach was a kind of commodi wagonett  invent by the modernist talent of the courier  who domin the expedit with his scientif activ and breezi wit  the theori of danger from thiev was banish from thought and speech  though so far conced in formal act that some slight protect was employ  the courier and the young banker carri load revolv  and muscari  with much boyish gratif  buckl on a kind of cutlass under his black cloak  he had plant his person at a fli leap next to the love englishwoman  on the other side of her sat the priest  whose name was brown and who was fortun a silent individu  the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind  muscari was in tower spirit  serious believ in the peril  and his talk to ethel might well have made her think him a maniac  but there was someth in the crazi and gorgeous ascent  amid crag like peak load with wood like orchard  that drag her spirit up alon with his into purpl preposter heaven with wheel sun  the white road climb like a white cat  it span sunless chasm like a tight  rope  it was flung round far  off headland like a lasso  and yet  howev high they went  the desert still blossom like the rose  the field were burnish in sun and wind with the colour of kingfish and parrot and hum  bird  the hue of a hundr flower flower  there are no loveli meadow and woodland than the english  no nobler crest or chasm than those of snowdon and glenco  but ethel harrog had never befor seen the southern park tilt on the splinter northern peak  the gorg of glenco laden with the fruit of kent  there was noth here of that chill and desol that in britain one associ with high and wild sceneri  it was rather like a mosaic palac  rent with earthquak  or like a dutch tulip garden blown to the star with dynamit   it  s like kew garden on beachi head  said ethel   it is our secret  answer he   the secret of the volcano  that is also the secret of the revolut  that a thing can be violent and yet fruit   you are rather violent yourself  and she smile at him   and yet rather fruitless  he admit   if i die tonight i die unmarri and a fool   it is not my fault if you have come  she said after a difficult silenc   it is never your fault  answer muscari   it was not your fault that troy fell  as they spoke they came under overwhelm cliff that spread almost like wing abov a corner of peculiar peril  shock by the big shadow on the narrow ledg  the hors stir doubt  the driver leapt to the earth to hold their head  and they becam ungovern  one hors rear up to his full height  the titan and terrifi height of a hors when he becom a bipe  it was just enough to alter the equilibrium  the whole coach heel over like a ship and crash through the fring of bush over the cliff  muscari threw an arm round ethel  who clung to him  and shout aloud  it was for such moment that he live  at the moment when the gorgeous mountain wall went round the poet  s head like a purpl windmil a thing happen which was superfici even more startl  the elder and letharg banker sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipic befor the tilt vehicl could take him there  in the first flash it look as wild as suicid  but in the second it was as sensibl as a safe invest  the yorkshireman had evid more promptitud  as well as more sagac  than muscari had given him credit for  for he land in a lap of land which might have been special pad with turf and clover to receiv him  as it happen  inde  the whole compani were equal lucki  if less dignifi in their form of eject  immedi under this abrupt turn of the road was a grassi and floweri hollow like a sunken meadow  a sort of green velvet pocket in the long  green  trail garment of the hill  into this they were all tip or tumbl with littl damag  save that their smallest baggag and even the content of their pocket were scatter in the grass around them  the wreck coach still hung abov  entangl in the tough hedg  and the hors plung pain down the slope  the first to sit up was the littl priest  who scratch his head with a face of foolish wonder  frank harrog heard him say to himself   now whi on earth have we fallen just here  he blink at the litter around him  and recov his own veri clumsi umbrella  beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of muscari  and besid it a seal busi letter which  after a glanc at the address  he return to the elder harrog  on the other side of him the grass part hid miss ethel  s sunshad  and just beyond it lay a curious littl glass bottl hard two inch long  the priest pick it up  in a quick  unobtrus manner he uncork and snif it  and his heavi face turn the colour of clay   heaven deliv us  he mutter   it can  t be her  has her sorrow come on her alreadi  he slip it into his own waistcoat pocket   i think i  m justifi  he said   till i know a littl more  he gaze pain at the girl  at that moment be rais out of the flower by muscari  who was say   we have fallen into heaven  it is a sign  mortal climb up and they fall down  but it is onli god and goddess who can fall upward  and inde she rose out of the sea of colour so beauti and happi a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shift   after all  he thought   perhap the poison isn  t her  perhap it  s one of muscari  s melodramat trick  muscari set the ladi light on her feet  made her an absurd theatric bow  and then  draw his cutlass  hack hard at the taut rein of the hors  so that they scrambl to their feet and stood in the grass trembl  when he had done so  a most remark thing occur  a veri quiet man  veri poor dress and extrem sunburnt  came out of the bush and took hold of the hors  head  he had a queer  shape knife  veri broad and crook  buckl on his belt  there was noth els remark about him  except his sudden and silent appear  the poet ask him who he was  and he did not answer  look around him at the confus and startl group in the hollow  muscari then perceiv that anoth tan and tatter man  with a short gun under his arm  was look at them from the ledg just below  lean his elbow on the edg of the turf  then he look up at the road from which they had fallen and saw  look down on them  the muzzl of four other carbin and four other brown face with bright but quit motionless eye   the brigand  cri muscari  with a kind of monstrous gaieti   this was a trap  ezza  if you will oblig me by shoot the coachman first  we can cut our way out yet  there are onli six of them   the coachman  said ezza  who was stand grim with his hand in his pocket   happen to be a servant of mr harrog  s   then shoot him all the more  cri the poet impati   he was bribe to upset his master  then put the ladi in the middl  and we will break the line up there  with a rush  and  wade in wild grass and flower  he advanc fearless on the four carbin  but find that no one follow except young harrog  he turn  brandish his cutlass to wave the other on  he beheld the courier still stand slight astrid in the centr of the grassi ring  his hand in his pocket  and his lean  iron italian face seem to grow longer and longer in the even light   you thought  muscari  i was the failur among our schoolfellow  he said   and you thought you were the success  but i have succeed more than you and fill a bigger place in histori  i have been act epic while you have been write them   come on  i tell you  thunder muscari from abov   will you stand there talk nonsens about yourself with a woman to save and three strong men to help you  what do you call yourself   i call myself montano  cri the strang courier in a voic equal loud and full   i am the king of thiev  and i welcom you all to my summer palac  and even as he spoke five more silent men with weapon readi came out of the bush  and look toward him for their order  one of them held a larg paper in his hand   this pretti littl nest where we are all picnick  went on the courier  brigand  with the same easi yet sinist smile   is  togeth with some cave underneath it  known by the name of the paradis of thiev  it is my princip stronghold on these hill  for  as you have doubtless notic  the eyri is invis both from the road abov and from the valley below  it is someth better than impregn  it is unnotic  here i most live  and here i shall certain die  if the gendarm ever track me here  i am not the kind of crimin that  reserv his defenc  but the better kind that reserv his last bullet  all were stare at him thunderstruck and still  except father brown  who heav a huge sigh as of relief and finger the littl phial in his pocket   thank god  he mutter   that  s much more probabl  the poison belong to this robber  chief  of cours  he carri it so that he may never be captur  like cato  the king of thiev was  howev  continu his address with the same kind of danger polit   it onli remain for me  he said   to explain to my guest the social condit upon which i have the pleasur of entertain them  i need not expound the quaint old ritual of ransom  which it is incumb upon me to keep up  and even this onli appli to a part of the compani  the reverend father brown and the celebr signor muscari i shall releas tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outpost  poet and priest  if you will pardon my simplic of speech  never have ani money  and so  sinc it is imposs to get anyth out of them  let us  seiz the opportun to show our admir for classic literatur and our rever for holi church  he paus with an unpleas smile  and father brown blink repeat at him  and seem sudden to be listen with great attent  the brigand captain took the larg paper from the attend brigand and  glanc over it  continu   my other intent are clear set forth in this public document  which i will hand round in a moment  and which after that will be post on a tree by everi villag in the valley  and everi cross  road in the hill  i will not weari you with the verbal  sinc you will be abl to check it  the substanc of my proclam is this  i announc first that i have captur the english millionair  the colossus of financ  mr samuel harrog  i next announc that i have found on his person note and bond for two thousand pound  which he has given up to me  now sinc it would be realli immor to announc such a thing to a credul public if it had not occur  i suggest it should occur without further delay  i suggest that mr harrog senior should now give me the two thousand pound in his pocket  the banker look at him under lower brow  red  face and sulki  but seem cow  that leap from the fail carriag seem to have use up his last viril  he had held back in a hang  dog style when his son and muscari had made a bold movement to break out of the brigand trap  and now his red and trembl hand went reluct to his breast  pocket  and pass a bundl of paper and envelop to the brigand   excel  cri that outlaw gaili   so far we are all cosi  i resum the point of my proclam  so soon to be publish to all itali  the third item is that of ransom  i am ask from the friend of the harrog famili a ransom of three thousand pound  which i am sure is almost insult to that famili in it moder estim of their import  who would not pay tripl this sum for anoth day  s associ with such a domest circl  i will not conceal from you that the document end with certain legal phrase about the unpleas thing that may happen if the money is not paid  but meanwhil  ladi and gentlemen  let me assur you that i am comfort off here for accommod  wine and cigar  and bid you for the present a sportsman  like welcom to the luxuri of the paradis of thiev  all the time that he had been speak  the dubious  look men with carbin and dirti slouch hat had been gather silent in such preponder number that even muscari was compel to recogn his salli with the sword as hopeless  he glanc around him  but the girl had alreadi gone over to sooth and comfort her father  for her natur affect for his person was as strong or stronger than her somewhat snobbish pride in his success  muscari  with the illog of a lover  admir this filial devot  and yet was irrit by it  he slap his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkili on one of the green bank  the priest sat down within a yard or two  and muscari turn his aquilin nose on him in an instantan irrit   well  said the poet tart   do peopl still think me too romant  are there  i wonder  ani brigand left in the mountain   there may be  said father brown agnost   what do you mean  ask the other sharpli   i mean i am puzzl  repli the priest   i am puzzl about ezza or montano  or whatev his name is  he seem to me much more inexplic as a brigand even than he was as a courier   but in what way  persist his companion   santa maria  i should have thought the brigand was plain enough   i find three curious difficulti  said the priest in a quiet voic   i should like to have your opinion on them  first of all i must tell you i was lunch in that restaur at the seasid  as four of you left the room  you and miss harrog went ahead  talk and laugh  the banker and the courier came behind  speak spare and rather low  but i could not help hear ezza say these word  well  let her have a littl fun  you know the blow may smash her ani minut  mr harrog answer noth  so the word must have had some mean  on the impuls of the moment i warn her brother that she might be in peril  i said noth of it natur  for i did not know  but if it meant this captur in the hill  the thing is nonsens  whi should the brigand  courier warn his patron  even by a hint  when it was his whole purpos to lure him into the mountain  mousetrap  it could not have meant that  but if not  what is this disast  known both to courier and banker  which hang over miss harrog  s head   disast to miss harrog  ejacul the poet  sit up with some feroc   explain yourself  go on   all my riddl  howev  revolv round our bandit chief  resum the priest reflect   and here is the second of them  whi did he put so promin in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two thousand pound from his victim on the spot  it had no faintest tendenc to evok the ransom  quit the other way  in fact  harrog  s friend would be far likeli to fear for his fate if they thought the thiev were poor and desper  yet the spoliat on the spot was emphas and even put first in the demand  whi should ezza montano want so special to tell all europ that he had pick the pocket befor he levi the blackmail   i cannot imagin  said muscari  rub up his black hair for onc with an unaffect gestur   you may think you enlighten me  but you are lead me deeper in the dark  what may be the third object to the king of the thiev   the third object  said father brown  still in medit   is this bank we are sit on  whi doe our brigand  courier call this his chief fortress and the paradis of thiev  it is certain a soft spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look at  it is also quit true  as he say  that it is invis from valley and peak  and is therefor a hide  place  but it is not a fortress  it never could be a fortress  i think it would be the worst fortress in the world  for it is actual command from abov by the common high  road across the mountain  the veri place where the polic would most probabl pass  whi  five shabbi short gun held us helpless here about half an hour ago  the quarter of a compani of ani kind of soldier could have blown us over the precipic  whatev is the mean of this odd littl nook of grass and flower  it is not an entrench posit  it is someth els  it has some other strang sort of import  some valu that i do not understand  it is more like an accident theatr or a natur green  room  it is like the scene for some romant comedi  it is like  as the littl priest  s word lengthen and lost themselv in a dull and dreami sincer  muscari  whose anim sens were alert and impati  heard a new nois in the mountain  even for him the sound was as yet veri small and faint  but he could have sworn the even breez bore with it someth like the pulsat of hors  hoof and a distant halloo  at the same moment  and long befor the vibrat had touch the less  experienc english ear  montano the brigand ran up the bank abov them and stood in the broken hedg  steadi himself against a tree and peer down the road  he was a strang figur as he stood there  for he had assum a flap fantast hat and swing baldric and cutlass in his capac of bandit king  but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier show through in patch all over him  the next moment he turn his oliv  sneer face and made a movement with his hand  the brigand scatter at the signal  not in confus  but in what was evid a kind of guerrilla disciplin  instead of occupi the road along the ridg  they sprinkl themselv along the side of it behind the tree and the hedg  as if watch unseen for an enemi  the nois beyond grew stronger  begin to shake the mountain road  and a voic could be clear heard call out order  the brigand sway and huddl  curs and whisper  and the even air was full of littl metal nois as they cock their pistol  or loosen their knive  or trail their scabbard over the stone  then the nois from both quarter seem to meet on the road abov  branch broke  hors neigh  men cri out   a rescu  cri muscari  spring to his feet and wave his hat   the gendarm are on them  now for freedom and a blow for it  now to be rebel against robber  come  don  t let us leav everyth to the polic  that is so dread modern  fall on the rear of these ruffian  the gendarm are rescu us  come  friend  let us rescu the gendarm  and throw his hat over the tree  he drew his cutlass onc more and began to escalad the slope up to the road  frank harrog jump up and ran across to help him  revolv in hand  but was astound to hear himself imper recal by the raucous voic of his father  who seem to be in great agit   i won  t have it  said the banker in a choke voic   i command you not to interfer   but  father  said frank veri warm   an italian gentleman has led the way  you wouldn  t have it said that the english hung back   it is useless  said the older man  who was trembl violent   it is useless  we must submit to our lot  father brown look at the banker  then he put his hand instinct as if on his heart  but realli on the littl bottl of poison  and a great light came into his face like the light of the revel of death  muscari meanwhil  without wait for support  had crest the bank up to the road  and struck the brigand king heavili on the shoulder  caus him to stagger and swing round  montano also had his cutlass unsheath  and muscari  without further speech  sent a slash at his head which he was compel to catch and parri  but even as the two short blade cross and clash the king of thiev deliber drop his point and laugh   what  s the good  old man  he said in spirit italian slang   this damn farc will soon be over   what do you mean  you shuffler  pant the fire  eat poet   is your courag a sham as well as your honesti   everyth about me is a sham  respond the ex  courier in complet good humour   i am an actor  and if i ever had a privat charact  i have forgotten it  i am no more a genuin brigand than i am a genuin courier  i am onli a bundl of mask  and you can  t fight a duel with that  and he laugh with boyish pleasur and fell into his old straddl attitud  with his back to the skirmish up the road  dark was deepen under the mountain wall  and it was not easi to discern much of the progress of the struggl  save that tall men were push their hors  muzzl through a cling crowd of brigand  who seem more inclin to harass and hustl the invad than to kill them  it was more like a town crowd prevent the passag of the polic than anyth the poet had ever pictur as the last stand of doom and outlaw men of blood  just as he was roll his eye in bewilder he felt a touch on his elbow  and found the odd littl priest stand there like a small noah with a larg hat  and request the favour of a word or two   signor muscari  said the cleric   in this queer crisi person may be pardon  i may tell you without offenc of a way in which you will do more good than by help the gendarm  who are bound to break through in ani case  you will permit me the impertin intimaci  but do you care about that girl  care enough to marri her and make her a good husband  i mean   yes  said the poet quit simpli   doe she care about you   i think so  was the equal grave repli   then go over there and offer yourself  said the priest   offer her everyth you can  offer her heaven and earth if you  ve got them  the time is short   whi  ask the astonish man of letter   becaus  said father brown   her doom is come up the road   noth is come up the road  argu muscari   except the rescu   well  you go over there  said his advis   and be readi to rescu her from the rescu  almost as he spoke the hedg were broken all along the ridg by a rush of the escap brigand  they dive into bush and thick grass like defeat men pursu  and the great cock hat of the mount gendarmeri were seen pass along abov the broken hedg  anoth order was given  there was a nois of dismount  and a tall offic with cock hat  a grey imperi  and a paper in his hand appear in the gap that was the gate of the paradis of thiev  there was a momentari silenc  broken in an extraordinari way by the banker  who cri out in a hoars and strangl voic   rob  i  ve been rob   whi  that was hour ago  cri his son in astonish   when you were rob of two thousand pound   not of two thousand pound  said the financi  with an abrupt and terribl composur   onli of a small bottl  the policeman with the grey imperi was stride across the green hollow  encount the king of the thiev in his path  he clap him on the shoulder with someth between a caress and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him

 iii  the duel of dr hirsch m  mauric brun and m  armand armagnac were cross the sunlit champ elyse with a kind of vivaci respect  they were both short  brisk and bold  they both had black beard that did not seem to belong to their face  after the strang french fashion which make real hair look like artifici  m  brun had a dark wedg of beard appar affix under his lower lip  m  armagnac  by way of a chang  had two beard  one stick out from each corner of his emphat chin  they were both young  they were both atheist  with a depress fixiti of outlook but great mobil of exposit  they were both pupil of the great dr hirsch  scientist  publicist and moralist  m  brun had becom promin by his propos that the common express  adieu  should be obliter from all the french classic  and a slight fine impos for it use in privat life   then  he said   the veri name of your imagin god will have echo for the last time in the ear of man  m  armagnac special rather in a resist to militar  and wish the chorus of the marseillais alter from  aux arm  citoyen  to  aux greve  citoyen  but his antimilitar was of a peculiar and gallic sort  an emin and veri wealthi english quaker  who had come to see him to arrang for the disarma of the whole planet  was rather distress by armagnac  s propos that  by way of begin  the soldier should shoot their offic  and inde it was in this regard that the two men differ most from their leader and father in philosophi  dr hirsch  though born in franc and cover with the most triumphant favour of french educ  was temperament of anoth type  mild  dreami  human  and  despit his sceptic system  not devoid of transcendent  he was  in short  more like a german than a frenchman  and much as they admir him  someth in the subconsci of these gaul was irrit at his plead for peac in so peac a manner  to their parti throughout europ  howev  paul hirsch was a saint of scienc  his larg and dare cosmic theori advertis his auster life and innoc  if somewhat frigid  moral  he held someth of the posit of darwin doubl with the posit of tolstoy  but he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot  his view on disarma were moder and evolutionari  the republican govern put consider confid in him as to various chemic improv  he had late even discov a noiseless explos  the secret of which the govern was care guard  his hous stood in a handsom street near the elyse  a street which in that strong summer seem almost as full of foliag as the park itself  a row of chestnut shatter the sunshin  interrupt onli in one place where a larg cafe ran out into the street  almost opposit to this were the white and green blind of the great scientist  s hous  an iron balconi  also paint green  run along in front of the first  floor window  beneath this was the entranc into a kind of court  gay with shrub and tile  into which the two frenchmen pass in anim talk  the door was open to them by the doctor  s old servant  simon  who might veri well have pass for a doctor himself  have a strict suit of black  spectacl  grey hair  and a confidenti manner  in fact  he was a far more present man of scienc than his master  dr hirsch  who was a fork radish of a fellow  with just enough bulb of a head to make his bodi insignific  with all the graviti of a great physician handl a prescript  simon hand a letter to m  armagnac  that gentleman rip it up with a racial impati  and rapid read the follow  i cannot come down to speak to you  there is a man in this hous whom i refus to meet  he is a chauvinist offic  dubosc  he is sit on the stair  he has been kick the furnitur about in all the other room  i have lock myself in my studi  opposit that cafe  if you love me  go over to the cafe and wait at one of the tabl outsid  i will tri to send him over to you  i want you to answer him and deal with him  i cannot meet him myself  i cannot  i will not  there is go to be anoth dreyfus case  p  hirsch m  armagnac look at m  brun  m  brun borrow the letter  read it  and look at m  armagnac  then both betook themselv brisk to one of the littl tabl under the chestnut opposit  where they procur two tall glass of horribl green absinth  which they could drink appar in ani weather and at ani time  otherwis the cafe seem empti  except for one soldier drink coffe at one tabl  and at anoth a larg man drink a small syrup and a priest drink noth  mauric brun clear his throat and said   of cours we must help the master in everi way  but  there was an abrupt silenc  and armagnac said   he may have excel reason for not meet the man himself  but  befor either could complet a sentenc  it was evid that the invad had been expel from the hous opposit  the shrub under the archway sway and burst apart  as that unwelcom guest was shot out of them like a cannon  ball  he was a sturdi figur in a small and tilt tyrolean felt hat  a figur that had inde someth general tyrolean about it  the man  s shoulder were big and broad  but his leg were neat and activ in knee  breech and knit stock  his face was brown like a nut  he had veri bright and restless brown eye  his dark hair was brush back stiffli in front and crop close behind  outlin a squar and power skull  and he had a huge black moustach like the horn of a bison  such a substanti head is general base on a bull neck  but this was hidden by a big colour scarf  swath round up the man  s ear and fall in front insid his jacket like a sort of fanci waistcoat  it was a scarf of strong dead colour  dark red and old gold and purpl  probabl of orient fabric  altogeth the man had someth a shade barbar about him  more like a hungarian squir than an ordinari french offic  his french  howev  was obvious that of a nativ  and his french patriot was so impuls as to be slight absurd  his first act when he burst out of the archway was to call in a clarion voic down the street   are there ani frenchmen here  as if he were call for christian in mecca  armagnac and brun instant stood up  but they were too late  men were alreadi run from the street corner  there was a small but ever  cluster crowd  with the prompt french instinct for the polit of the street  the man with the black moustach had alreadi run across to a corner of the cafe  sprung on one of the tabl  and seiz a branch of chestnut to steadi himself  shout as camill desmoulin onc shout when he scatter the oak  leav among the populac   frenchmen  he volley   i cannot speak  god help me  that is whi i am speak  the fellow in their filthi parliament who learn to speak also learn to be silent  silent as that spi cower in the hous opposit  silent as he is when i beat on his bedroom door  silent as he is now  though he hear my voic across this street and shake where he sit  oh  they can be silent eloqu  the politician  but the time has come when we that cannot speak must speak  you are betray to the prussian  betray at this moment  betray by that man  i am jule dubosc  colonel of artilleri  belfort  we caught a german spi in the vosg yesterday  and a paper was found on him  a paper i hold in my hand  oh  they tri to hush it up  but i took it direct to the man who wrote it  the man in that hous  it is in his hand  it is sign with his initi  it is a direct for find the secret of this new noiseless powder  hirsch invent it  hirsch wrote this note about it  this note is in german  and was found in a german  s pocket   tell the man the formula for powder is in grey envelop in first drawer to the left of secretari  s desk  war offic  in red ink  he must be care  p  h  he rattl short sentenc like a quick  fire gun  but he was plain the sort of man who is either mad or right  the mass of the crowd was nationalist  and alreadi in threaten uproar  and a minor of equal angri intellectu  led by armagnac and brun  onli made the major more milit   if this is a militari secret  shout brun   whi do you yell about it in the street   i will tell you whi i do  roar dubosc abov the roar crowd   i went to this man in straight and civil style  if he had ani explan it could have been given in complet confid  he refus to explain  he refer me to two stranger in a cafe as to two flunkey  he has thrown me out of the hous  but i am go back into it  with the peopl of pari behind me  a shout seem to shake the veri facad of mansion and two stone flew  one break a window abov the balconi  the indign colonel plung onc more under the archway and was heard cri and thunder insid  everi instant the human sea grew wider and wider  it surg up against the rail and step of the traitor  s hous  it was alreadi certain that the place would be burst into like the bastill  when the broken french window open and dr hirsch came out on the balconi  for an instant the furi half turn to laughter  for he was an absurd figur in such a scene  his long bare neck and slope shoulder were the shape of a champagn bottl  but that was the onli festiv thing about him  his coat hung on him as on a peg  he wore his carrot  colour hair long and weedi  his cheek and chin were fulli fring with one of those irrit beard that begin far from the mouth  he was veri pale  and he wore blue spectacl  livid as he was  he spoke with a sort of prim decis  so that the mob fell silent in the middl of his third sentenc   onli two thing to say to you now  the first is to my foe  the second to my friend  to my foe i say  it is true i will not meet m  dubosc  though he is storm outsid this veri room  it is true i have ask two other men to confront him for me  and i will tell you whi  becaus i will not and must not see him  becaus it would be against all rule of digniti and honour to see him  befor i am triumphant clear befor a court  there is anoth arbitr this gentleman owe me as a gentleman  and in refer him to my second i am strict  armagnac and brun were wave their hat wild  and even the doctor  s enemi roar applaus at this unexpect defianc  onc more a few sentenc were inaud  but they could hear him say   to my friend  i myself should alway prefer weapon pure intellectu  and to these an evolv human will certain confin itself  but our own most precious truth is the fundament forc of matter and hered  my book are success  my theori are unrefut  but i suffer in polit from a prejudic almost physic in the french  i cannot speak like clemenceau and derouled  for their word are like echo of their pistol  the french ask for a duellist as the english ask for a sportsman  well  i give my proof  i will pay this barbar bribe  and then go back to reason for the rest of my life  two men were instant found in the crowd itself to offer their servic to colonel dubosc  who came out present  satisfi  one was the common soldier with the coffe  who said simpli   i will act for you  sir  i am the duc de valogn  the other was the big man  whom his friend the priest sought at first to dissuad  and then walk away alon  in the earli even a light dinner was spread at the back of the cafe charlemagn  though unroof by ani glass or gilt plaster  the guest were near all under a delic and irregular roof of leav  for the ornament tree stood so thick around and among the tabl as to give someth of the dim and the dazzl of a small orchard  at one of the central tabl a veri stumpi littl priest sat in complet solitud  and appli himself to a pile of whitebait with the gravest sort of enjoy  his daili live be veri plain  he had a peculiar tast for sudden and isol luxuri  he was an abstemi epicur  he did not lift his eye from his plate  round which red pepper  lemon  brown bread and butter  etc  were rigid rank  until a tall shadow fell across the tabl  and his friend flambeau sat down opposit  flambeau was gloomi   i  m afraid i must chuck this busi  said he heavili   i  m all on the side of the french soldier like dubosc  and i  m all against the french atheist like hirsch  but it seem to me in this case we  ve made a mistak  the duke and i thought it as well to investig the charg  and i must say i  m glad we did   is the paper a forgeri  then  ask the priest  that  s just the odd thing  repli flambeau   it  s exact like hirsch  s write  and nobodi can point out ani mistak in it  but it wasn  t written by hirsch  if he  s a french patriot he didn  t write it  becaus it give inform to germani  and if he  s a german spi he didn  t write it  well  becaus it doesn  t give inform to germani   you mean the inform is wrong  ask father brown   wrong  repli the other   and wrong exact where dr hirsch would have been right  about the hide  place of his own secret formula in his own offici depart  by favour of hirsch and the author  the duke and i have actual been allow to inspect the secret drawer at the war offic where the hirsch formula is kept  we are the onli peopl who have ever known it  except the inventor himself and the minist for war  but the minist permit it to save hirsch from fight  after that we realli can  t support dubosc if his revel is a mare  s nest   and it is  ask father brown   it is  said his friend gloomili   it is a clumsi forgeri by somebodi who knew noth of the real hide  place  it say the paper is in the cupboard on the right of the secretari  s desk  as a fact the cupboard with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk  it say the grey envelop contain a long document written in red ink  it isn  t written in red ink  but in ordinari black ink  it  s manifest absurd to say that hirsch can have made a mistak about a paper that nobodi knew of but himself  or can have tri to help a foreign thief by tell him to fumbl in the wrong drawer  i think we must chuck it up and apolog to old carrot  father brown seem to cogit  he lift a littl whitebait on his fork   you are sure the grey envelop was in the left cupboard  he ask   posit  repli flambeau   the grey envelop  it was a white envelop realli  was  father brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and stare across at his companion   what  he ask  in an alter voic   well  what  repeat flambeau  eat heartili   it was not grey  said the priest   flambeau  you frighten me   what the deuc are you frighten of   i  m frighten of a white envelop  said the other serious   if it had onli just been grey  hang it all  it might as well have been grey  but if it was white  the whole busi is black  the doctor has been dabbl in some of the old brimston after all   but i tell you he couldn  t have written such a note  cri flambeau   the note is utter wrong about the fact  and innoc or guilti  dr hirsch knew all about the fact   the man who wrote that note knew all about the fact  said his cleric companion sober   he could never have got  em so wrong without know about  em  you have to know an aw lot to be wrong on everi subject  like the devil   do you mean   i mean a man tell lie on chanc would have told some of the truth  said his friend firm   suppos someon sent you to find a hous with a green door and a blue blind  with a front garden but no back garden  with a dog but no cat  and where they drank coffe but not tea  you would say if you found no such hous that it was all made up  but i say no  i say if you found a hous where the door was blue and the blind green  where there was a back garden and no front garden  where cat were common and dog instant shot  where tea was drunk in quart and coffe forbidden  then you would know you had found the hous  the man must have known that particular hous to be so accur inaccur   but what could it mean  demand the diner opposit   i can  t conceiv  said brown   i don  t understand this hirsch affair at all  as long as it was onli the left drawer instead of the right  and red ink instead of black  i thought it must be the chanc blunder of a forger  as you say  but three is a mystic number  it finish thing  it finish this  that the direct about the drawer  the colour of ink  the colour of envelop  should none of them be right by accid  that can  t be a coincid  it wasn  t   what was it  then  treason  ask flambeau  resum his dinner   i don  t know that either  answer brown  with a face of blank bewilder   the onli thing i can think of  well  i never understood that dreyfus case  i can alway grasp moral evid easier than the other sort  i go by a man  s eye and voic  don  t you know  and whether his famili seem happi  and by what subject he choos  and avoid  well  i was puzzl in the dreyfus case  not by the horribl thing imput both way  i know  though it  s not modern to say so  that human natur in the highest place is still capabl of be cenci or borgia  no  what puzzl me was the sincer of both parti  i don  t mean the polit parti  the rank and file are alway rough honest  and often dupe  i mean the person of the play  i mean the conspir  if they were conspir  i mean the traitor  if he was a traitor  i mean the men who must have known the truth  now dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was a wrong man  and yet the french statesmen and soldier went on as if they knew he wasn  t a wrong man but simpli a wrong  un  i don  t mean they behav well  i mean they behav as if they were sure  i can  t describ these thing  i know what i mean   i wish i did  said his friend   and what has it to do with old hirsch   suppos a person in a posit of trust  went on the priest   began to give the enemi inform becaus it was fals inform  suppos he even thought he was save his countri by mislead the foreign  suppos this brought him into spi circl  and littl loan were made to him  and littl tie tie on to him  suppos he kept up his contradictori posit in a confus way by never tell the foreign spi the truth  but let it more and more be guess  the better part of him  what was left of it  would still say   i have not help the enemi  i said it was the left drawer  the meaner part of him would alreadi be say   but they may have the sens to see that mean the right  i think it is psycholog possibl  in an enlighten age  you know   it may be psycholog possibl  answer flambeau   and it certain would explain dreyfus be certain he was wrong and his judg be sure he was guilti  but it won  t wash histor  becaus dreyfus  s document  if it was his document  was liter correct   i wasn  t think of dreyfus  said father brown  silenc had sunk around them with the empti of the tabl  it was alreadi late  though the sunlight still clung to everyth  as if accident entangl in the tree  in the still flambeau shift his seat sharpli  make an isol and echo nois  and threw his elbow over the angl of it   well  he said  rather harsh   if hirsch is not better than a timid treason  monger   you mustn  t be too hard on them  said father brown gentl   it  s not entir their fault  but they have no instinct  i mean those thing that make a woman refus to danc with a man or a man to touch an invest  they  ve been taught that it  s all a matter of degre   anyhow  cri flambeau impati   he  s not a patch on my princip  and i shall go through with it  old dubosc may be a bit mad  but he  s a sort of patriot after all  father brown continu to consum whitebait  someth in the stolid way he did so caus flambeau  s fierc black eye to rambl over his companion afresh   what  s the matter with you  flambeau demand   dubosc  s all right in that way  you don  t doubt him   my friend  said the small priest  lay down his knife and fork in a kind of cold despair   i doubt everyth  everyth  i mean  that has happen today  i doubt the whole stori  though it has been act befor my face  i doubt everi sight that my eye have seen sinc morn  there is someth in this busi quit differ from the ordinari polic mysteri where one man is more or less lie and the other man more or less tell the truth  here both men  well  i  ve told you the onli theori i can think of that could satisfi anybodi  it doesn  t satisfi me   nor me either  repli flambeau frown  while the other went on eat fish with an air of entir resign   if all you can suggest is that notion of a messag convey by contrari  i call it uncommon clever  but  well  what would you call it   i should call it thin  said the priest prompt   i should call it uncommon thin  but that  s the queer thing about the whole busi  the lie is like a schoolboy  s  there are onli three version  dubosc  s and hirsch  s and that fanci of mine  either that note was written by a french offic to ruin a french offici  or it was written by the french offici to help german offic  or it was written by the french offici to mislead german offic  veri well  you  d expect a secret paper pass between such peopl  offici or offic  to look quit differ from that  you  d expect  probabl a cipher  certain abbrevi  most certain scientif and strict profession term  but this thing  s elabor simpl  like a penni dread   in the purpl grotto you will find the golden casket  it look as if  as if it were meant to be seen through at onc  almost befor they could take it in a short figur in french uniform had walk up to their tabl like the wind  and sat down with a sort of thump   i have extraordinari news  said the duc de valogn   i have just come from this colonel of our  he is pack up to leav the countri  and he ask us to make his excus sur le terrain   what  cri flambeau  with an incredul quit fright   apolog   yes  said the duke gruffli   then and there  befor everybodi  when the sword are drawn  and you and i have to do it while he is leav the countri   but what can this mean  cri flambeau   he can  t be afraid of that littl hirsch  confound it  he cri  in a kind of ration rage   nobodi could be afraid of hirsch   i believ it  s some plot  snap valogn  some plot of the jew and freemason  it  s meant to work up glori for hirsch  the face of father brown was commonplac  but curious content  it could shine with ignor as well as with knowledg  but there was alway one flash when the foolish mask fell  and the wise mask fit itself in it place  and flambeau  who knew his friend  knew that his friend had sudden understood  brown said noth  but finish his plate of fish   where did you last see our precious colonel  ask flambeau  irrit   he  s round at the hotel saint loui by the elyse  where we drove with him  he  s pack up  i tell you   will he be there still  do you think  ask flambeau  frown at the tabl   i don  t think he can get away yet  repli the duke   he  s pack to go a long journey   no  said father brown  quit simpli  but sudden stand up   for a veri short journey  for one of the shortest  in fact  but we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor  cab  noth more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the corner by the hotel saint loui  where they got out  and he led the parti up a side lane alreadi in deep shadow with the grow dusk  onc  when the duke impati ask whether hirsch was guilti of treason or not  he answer rather absent   no  onli of ambit  like caesar  then he somewhat inconsequ ad   he live a veri lone life  he has had to do everyth for himself   well  if he  s ambiti  he ought to be satisfi now  said flambeau rather bitter   all pari will cheer him now our curs colonel has turn tail   don  t talk so loud  said father brown  lower his voic   your curs colonel is just in front  the other two start and shrank farther back into the shadow of the wall  for the sturdi figur of their runaway princip could inde be seen shuffl along in the twilight in front  a bag in each hand  he look much the same as when they first saw him  except that he had chang his picturesqu mountain knicker for a convent pair of trouser  it was clear he was alreadi escap from the hotel  the lane down which they follow him was one of those that seem to be at the back of thing  and look like the wrong side of the stage sceneri  a colourless  continu wall ran down one flank of it  interrupt at interv by dull  hu and dirt  stain door  all shut fast and featureless save for the chalk scribbl of some pass gamin  the top of tree  most rather depress evergreen  show at interv over the top of the wall  and beyond them in the grey and purpl gloam could be seen the back of some long terrac of tall parisian hous  realli compar close  but somehow look as inaccess as a rang of marbl mountain  on the other side of the lane ran the high gilt rail of a gloomi park  flambeau was look round him in rather a weird way   do you know  he said   there is someth about this place that   hullo  call out the duke sharpli   that fellow  s disappear  vanish  like a blast fairi   he has a key  explain their cleric friend   he  s onli gone into one of these garden door  and as he spoke they heard one of the dull wooden door close again with a click in front of them  flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face  and stood in front of it for a moment  bite his black moustach in a furi of curios  then he threw up his long arm and swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall  his enorm figur dark against the purpl sky  like the dark tree  top  the duke look at the priest   dubosc  s escap is more elabor than we thought  he said   but i suppos he is escap from franc   he is escap from everywher  answer father brown  valogn  s eye brighten  but his voic sank   do you mean suicid  he ask   you will not find his bodi  repli the other  a kind of cri came from flambeau on the wall abov   my god  he exclaim in french   i know what this place is now  whi  it  s the back of the street where old hirsch live  i thought i could recogn the back of a hous as well as the back of a man   and dubosc  s gone in there  cri the duke  smite his hip   whi  they  ll meet after all  and with sudden gallic vivac he hop up on the wall besid flambeau and sat there posit kick his leg with excit  the priest alon remain below  lean against the wall  with his back to the whole theatr of event  and look wist across to the park pale and the twinkl  twilit tree  the duke  howev stimul  had the instinct of an aristocrat  and desir rather to stare at the hous than to spi on it  but flambeau  who had the instinct of a burglar  and a detect  had alreadi swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggl tree from which he could crawl quit close to the onli illumin window in the back of the high dark hous  a red blind had been pull down over the light  but pull crook  so that it gape on one side  and by risk his neck along a branch that look as treacher as a twig  flambeau could just see colonel dubosc walk about in a brilliant  light and luxuri bedroom  but close as flambeau was to the hous  he heard the word of his colleagu by the wall  and repeat them in a low voic   yes  they will meet now after all   they will never meet  said father brown   hirsch was right when he said that in such an affair the princip must not meet  have you read a queer psycholog stori by henri jame  of two person who so perpetu miss meet each other by accid that they began to feel quit frighten of each other  and to think it was fate  this is someth of the kind  but more curious   there are peopl in pari who will cure them of such morbid fanci  said valogn vindict   they will jolli well have to meet if we captur them and forc them to fight   they will not meet on the day of judgement  said the priest   if god almighti held the truncheon of the list  if st michael blew the trumpet for the sword to cross  even then  if one of them stood readi  the other would not come   oh  what doe all this mystic mean  cri the duc de valogn  impati   whi on earth shouldn  t they meet like other peopl   they are the opposit of each other  said father brown  with a queer kind of smile   they contradict each other  they cancel out  so to speak  he continu to gaze at the darken tree opposit  but valogn turn his head sharpli at a suppress exclam from flambeau  that investig  peer into the light room  had just seen the colonel  after a pace or two  proceed to take his coat off  flambeau  s first thought was that this realli look like a fight  but he soon drop the thought for anoth  the solid and squar of dubosc  s chest and shoulder was all a power piec of pad and came off with his coat  in his shirt and trouser he was a compar slim gentleman  who walk across the bedroom to the bathroom with no more pugnaci purpos than that of wash himself  he bent over a basin  dri his drip hand and face on a towel  and turn again so that the strong light fell on his face  his brown complexion had gone  his big black moustach had gone  he  was clean  shaven and veri pate  noth remain of the colonel but his bright  hawk  like  brown eye  under the wall father brown was go on in heavi medit  as if to himself   it is all just like what i was say to flambeau  these opposit won  t do  they don  t work  they don  t fight  if it  s white instead of black  and solid instead of liquid  and so on all along the line  then there  s someth wrong  monsieur  there  s someth wrong  one of these men is fair and the other dark  one stout and the other slim  one strong and the other weak  one has a moustach and no beard  so you can  t see his mouth  the other has a beard and no moustach  so you can  t see his chin  one has hair crop to his skull  but a scarf to hide his neck  the other has low shirt  collar  but long hair to bide his skull  it  s all too neat and correct  monsieur  and there  s someth wrong  thing made so opposit are thing that cannot quarrel  wherev the one stick out the other sink in  like a face and a mask  like a lock and a key  flambeau was peer into the hous with a visag as white as a sheet  the occup of the room was stand with his back to him  but in front of a look  glass  and had alreadi fit round his face a sort of framework of rank red hair  hang disord from the head and cling round the jaw and chin while leav the mock mouth uncov  seen thus in the glass the white face look like the face of juda laugh horribl and surround by caper flame of hell  for a spasm flambeau saw the fierc  red  brown eye danc  then they were cover with a pair of blue spectacl  slip on a loos black coat  the figur vanish toward the front of the hous  a few moment later a roar of popular applaus from the street beyond announc that dr hirsch had onc more appear upon the balconi  iv  the man in the passag two men appear simultan at the two end of a sort of passag run along the side of the apollo theatr in the adelphi  the even daylight in the street was larg and lumin  opalesc and empti  the passag was compar long and dark  so each man could see the other as a mere black silhouett at the other end  nevertheless  each man knew the other  even in that inki outlin  for they were both men of strike appear and they hate each other  the cover passag open at one end on one of the steep street of the adelphi  and at the other on a terrac overlook the sunset  colour river  one side of the passag was a blank wall  for the build it support was an old unsuccess theatr restaur  now shut up  the other side of the passag contain two door  one at each end  neither was what was common call the stage door  they were a sort of special and privat stage door use by veri special perform  and in this case by the star actor and actress in the shakespearean perform of the day  person of that emin often like to have such privat exit and entranc  for meet friend or avoid them  the two men in question were certain two such friend  men who evid knew the door and count on their open  for each approach the door at the upper end with equal cool and confid  not  howev  with equal speed  but the man who walk fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel  so they both arriv befor the secret stage door almost at the same instant  they salut each other with civil  and wait a moment befor one of them  the sharper walker who seem to have the shorter patienc  knock at the door  in this and everyth els each man was opposit and neither could be call inferior  as privat person both were handsom  capabl and popular  as public person  both were in the first public rank  but everyth about them  from their glori to their good look  was of a divers and incompar kind  sir wilson seymour was the kind of man whose import is known to everybodi who know  the more you mix with the innermost ring in everi politi or profess  the more often you met sir wilson seymour  he was the one intellig man on twenti unintellig committe  on everi sort of subject  from the reform of the royal academi to the project of bimetal for greater britain  in the art especi he was omnipot  he was so uniqu that nobodi could quit decid whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken up art  or a great artist whom the aristocrat had taken up  but you could not meet him for five minut without realiz that you had realli been rule by him all your life  his appear was  distinguish  in exact the same sens  it was at onc convent and uniqu  fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat  yet it was unlik anyon els  s hat  a littl higher  perhap  and ad someth to his natur height  his tall  slender figur had a slight stoop yet it look the revers of feebl  his hair was silver  grey  but he did not look old  it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effemin  it was cur but it did not look curl  his care point beard made him look more man and milit than otherwis  as it doe in those old admir of velazquez with whose dark portrait his hous was hung  his grey glove were a shade bluer  his silver  knob cane a shade longer than score of such glove and cane flap and flourish about the theatr and the restaur  the other man was not so tall  yet would have struck nobodi as short  but mere as strong and handsom  his hair also was cur  but fair and crop close to a strong  massiv head  the sort of head you break a door with  as chaucer said of the miller  s  his militari moustach and the carriag of his shoulder show him a soldier  but he had a pair of those peculiar frank and pierc blue eye which are more common in sailor  his face was somewhat squar  his jaw was squar  his shoulder were squar  even his jacket was squar  inde  in the wild school of caricatur then current  mr max beerbohm had repres him as a proposit in the fourth book of euclid  for he also was a public man  though with quit anoth sort of success  you did not have to be in the best societi to have heard of captain cutler  of the sieg of hong  kong  and the great march across china  you could not get away from hear of him wherev you were  his portrait was on everi other postcard  his map and battl in everi other illustr paper  song in his honour in everi other music  hall turn or on everi other barrel  organ  his fame  though probabl more temporari  was ten time more wide  popular and spontan than the other man  s  in thousand of english home he appear enorm abov england  like nelson  yet he had infinit less power in england than sir wilson seymour  the door was open to them by an age servant or  dresser  whose broken  down face and figur and black shabbi coat and trouser contrast queer with the glitter interior of the great actress  s dress  room  it was fit and fill with look  glass at everi angl of refract  so that they look like the hundr facet of one huge diamond  if one could get insid a diamond  the other featur of luxuri  a few flower  a few colour cushion  a few scrap of stage costum  were multipli by all the mirror into the mad of the arabian night  and danc and chang place perpetu as the shuffl attend shift a mirror outward or shot one back against the wall  they both spoke to the dingi dresser by name  call him parkinson  and ask for the ladi as miss aurora rome  parkinson said she was in the other room  but he would go and tell her  a shade cross the brow of both visitor  for the other room was the privat room of the great actor with whom miss aurora was perform  and she was of the kind that doe not inflam admir without inflam jealousi  in about half a minut  howev  the inner door open  and she enter as she alway did  even in privat life  so that the veri silenc seem to be a roar of applaus  and one well  deserv  she was clad in a somewhat strang garb of peacock green and peacock blue satin  that gleam like blue and green metal  such as delight children and aesthet  and her heavi  hot brown hair frame one of those magic face which are danger to all men  but especi to boy and to men grow grey  in compani with her male colleagu  the great american actor  isidor bruno  she was produc a particular poetic and fantast interpret of midsumm night  s dream  in which the artist promin was given to oberon and titania  or in other word to bruno and herself  set in dreami and exquisit sceneri  and move in mystic danc  the green costum  like burnish beetl  wing  express all the elus individu of an elfin queen  but when person confront in what was still broad daylight  a man look onli at the woman  s face  she greet both men with the beam and baffl smile which kept so mani male at the same just danger distanc from her  she accept some flower from cutler  which were as tropic and expens as his victori  and anoth sort of present from sir wilson seymour  offer later on and more nonchal by that gentleman  for it was against his breed to show eager  and against his convent unconvent to give anyth so obvious as flower  he had pick up a trifl  he said  which was rather a curios  it was an ancient greek dagger of the mycenaean epoch  and might well have been worn in the time of theseus and hippolyta  it was made of brass like all the heroic weapon  but  odd enough  sharp enough to prick anyon still  he had realli been attract to it by the leaf  like shape  it was as perfect as a greek vase  if it was of ani interest to miss rome or could come in anywher in the play  he hope she would  the inner door burst open and a big figur appear  who was more of a contrast to the explanatori seymour than even captain cutler  near six  foot  six  and of more than theatric thew and muscl  isidor bruno  in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden  brown garment of oberon  look like a barbar god  he lean on a sort of hunt  spear  which across a theatr look a slight  silveri wand  but which in the small and compar crowd room look as plain as a pike  staff  and as menac  his vivid black eye roll volcan  his bronz face  handsom as it was  show at that moment a combin of high cheekbon with set white teeth  which recal certain american conjectur about his origin in the southern plantat   aurora  he began  in that deep voic like a drum of passion that had move so mani audienc   will you  he stop indecis becaus a sixth figur had sudden present itself just insid the doorway  a figur so incongru in the scene as to be almost comic  it was a veri short man in the black uniform of the roman secular clergi  and look  especi in such a presenc as bruno  s and aurora  s  rather like the wooden noah out of an ark  he did not  howev  seem conscious of ani contrast  but said with dull civil   i believ miss rome sent for me  a shrewd observ might have remark that the emot temperatur rather rose at so unemot an interrupt  the detach of a profession celib seem to reveal to the other that they stood round the woman as a ring of amor rival  just as a stranger come in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnac  the presenc of the one man who did not care about her increas miss rome  s sens that everybodi els was in love with her  and each in a somewhat danger way  the actor with all the appetit of a savag and a spoilt child  the soldier with all the simpl selfish of a man of will rather than mind  sir wilson with that daili harden concentr with which old hedonist take to a hobbi  nay  even the abject parkinson  who had known her befor her triumph  and who follow her about the room with eye or feet  with the dumb fascin of a dog  a shrewd person might also have note a yet odder thing  the man like a black wooden noah  who was not wholli without shrewd  note it with a consider but contain amus  it was evid that the great aurora  though by no mean indiffer to the admir of the other sex  want at this moment to get rid of all the men who admir her and be left alon with the man who did not  did not admir her in that sens at least  for the littl priest did admir and even enjoy the firm feminin diplomaci with which she set about her task  there was  perhap  onli one thing that aurora rome was clever about  and that was one half of human  the other half  the littl priest watch  like a napoleon campaign  the swift precis of her polici for expel all while banish none  bruno  the big actor  was so babyish that it was easi to send him off in brute sulk  bang the door  cutler  the british offic  was pachydermat to idea  but punctili about behaviour  he would ignor all hint  but he would die rather than ignor a definit commiss from a ladi  as to old seymour  he had to be treat differ  he had to be left to the last  the onli way to move him was to appeal to him in confid as an old friend  to let him into the secret of the clearanc  the priest did realli admir miss rome as she achiev all these three object in one select action  she went across to captain cutler and said in her sweetest manner   i shall valu all these flower  becaus they must be your favourit flower  but they won  t be complet  you know  without my favourit flower  do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some lili  of  the  valley  and then it will be quit love  the first object of her diplomaci  the exit of the enrag bruno  was at onc achiev  he had alreadi hand his spear in a lord style  like a sceptr  to the piteous parkinson  and was about to assum one of the cushion seat like a throne  but at this open appeal to his rival there glow in his opal eyebal all the sensit insol of the slave  he knot his enorm brown fist for an instant  and then  dash open the door  disappear into his own apart beyond  but meanwhil miss rome  s experi in mobil the british armi had not succeed so simpli as seem probabl  cutler had inde risen stiffli and sudden  and walk toward the door  hatless  as if at a word of command  but perhap there was someth ostentati eleg about the languid figur of seymour lean against one of the look  glass that brought him up short at the entranc  turn his head this way and that like a bewild bulldog   i must show this stupid man where to go  said aurora in a whisper to seymour  and ran out to the threshold to speed the part guest  seymour seem to be listen  eleg and unconsci as was his postur  and he seem reliev when he heard the ladi call out some last instruct to the captain  and then turn sharpli and run laugh down the passag toward the other end  the end on the terrac abov the thame  yet a second or two after seymour  s brow darken again  a man in his posit has so mani rival  and he rememb that at the other end of the passag was the correspond entranc to bruno  s privat room  he did not lose his digniti  he said some civil word to father brown about the reviv of byzantin architectur in the westminst cathedr  and then  quit natur  stroll out himself into the upper end of the passag  father brown and parkinson were left alon  and they were neither of them men with a tast for superflu convers  the dresser went round the room  pull out look  glass and push them in again  his dingi dark coat and trouser look all the more dismal sinc he was still hold the festiv fairi spear of king oberon  everi time he pull out the frame of a new glass  a new black figur of father brown appear  the absurd glass chamber was full of father brown  upsid down in the air like angel  turn somersault like acrobat  turn their back to everybodi like veri rude person  father brown seem quit unconsci of this cloud of wit  but follow parkinson with an idl attent eye till he took himself and his absurd spear into the farther room of bruno  then he abandon himself to such abstract medit as alway amus him  calcul the angl of the mirror  the angl of each refract  the angl at which each must fit into the wall  when he heard a strong but strangl cri  he sprang to his feet and stood rigid listen  at the same instant sir wilson seymour burst back into the room  white as ivori   who  s that man in the passag  he cri   where  s that dagger of mine  befor father brown could turn in his heavi boot seymour was plung about the room look for the weapon  and befor he could possibl find that weapon or ani other  a brisk run of feet broke upon the pavement outsid  and the squar face of cutler was thrust into the same doorway  he was still grotesqu grasp a bunch of lili  of  the  valley   what  s this  he cri   what  s that creatur down the passag  is this some of your trick   my trick  hiss his pale rival  and made a stride toward him  in the instant of time in which all this happen father brown step out into the top of the passag  look down it  and at onc walk brisk toward what he saw  at this the other two men drop their quarrel and dart after him  cutler call out   what are you do  who are you   my name is brown  said the priest sad  as he bent over someth and straighten himself again   miss rome sent for me  and i came as quick as i could  i have come too late  the three men look down  and in one of them at least the life die in that late light of afternoon  it ran along the passag like a path of gold  and in the midst of it aurora rome lay lustrous in her robe of green and gold  with her dead face turn upward  her dress was torn away as in a struggl  leav the right shoulder bare  but the wound from which the blood was well was on the other side  the brass dagger lay flat and gleam a yard or so away  there was a blank still for a measur time  so that they could hear far off a flower  girl  s laugh outsid chare cross  and someon whistl furious for a taxicab in one of the street off the strand  then the captain  with a movement so sudden that it might have been passion or play  act  took sir wilson seymour by the throat  seymour look at him steadili without either fight or fear   you need not kill me  he said in a voic quit cold   i shall do that on my own account  the captain  s hand hesit and drop  and the other ad with the same ici candour   if i find i haven  t the nerv to do it with that dagger i can do it in a month with drink   drink isn  t good enough for me  repli cutler   but i  ll have blood for this befor i die  not your  but i think i know whose  and befor the other could appreci his intent he snatch up the dagger  sprang at the other door at the lower end of the passag  burst it open  bolt and all  and confront bruno in his dress  room  as he did so  old parkinson totter in his waver way out of the door and caught sight of the corps lie in the passag  he move shakili toward it  look at it weak with a work face  then move shakili back into the dress  room again  and sat down sudden on one of the rich cushion chair  father brown instant ran across to him  take no notic of cutler and the coloss actor  though the room alreadi rang with their blow and they began to struggl for the dagger  seymour  who retain some practic sens  was whistl for the polic at the end of the passag  when the polic arriv it was to tear the two men from an almost ape  like grappl  and  after a few formal inquiri  to arrest isidor bruno upon a charg of murder  brought against him by his furious oppon  the idea that the great nation hero of the hour had arrest a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had it weight with the polic  who are not without element of the journalist  they treat cutler with a certain solemn attent  and point out that he had got a slight slash on the hand  even as cutler bore him back across tilt chair and tabl  bruno had twist the dagger out of his grasp and disabl him just below the wrist  the injuri was realli slight  but till he was remov from the room the half  savag prison stare at the run blood with a steadi smile   look a cannib sort of chap  don  t he  said the constabl confidenti to cutler  cutler made no answer  but said sharpli a moment after   we must attend to the  the death  and his voic escap from articul   the two death  came in the voic of the priest from the farther side of the room   this poor fellow was gone when i got across to him  and he stood look down at old parkinson  who sat in a black huddl on the gorgeous chair  he also had paid his tribut  not without eloqu  to the woman who had die  the silenc was first broken by cutler  who seem not untouch by a rough tender   i wish i was him  he said huskili   i rememb he use to watch her wherev she walk more than  anybodi  she was his air  and he  s dri up  he  s just dead   we are all dead  said seymour in a strang voic  look down the road  they took leav of father brown at the corner of the road  with some random apolog for ani rude they might have shown  both their face were tragic  but also cryptic  the mind of the littl priest was alway a rabbit  warren of wild thought that jump too quick for him to catch them  like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanish thought that he was certain of their grief  but not so certain of their innoc   we had better all be go  said seymour heavili   we have done all we can to help   will you understand my motiv  ask father brown quiet   if i say you have done all you can to hurt  they both start as if guiltili  and cutler said sharpli   to hurt whom   to hurt yourselv  answer the priest   i would not add to your troubl if it weren  t common justic to warn you  you  ve done near everyth you could do to hang yourselv  if this actor should be acquit  they  ll be sure to subpoena me  i shall be bound to say that after the cri was heard each of you rush into the room in a wild state and began quarrel about a dagger  as far as my word on oath can go  you might either of you have done it  you hurt yourselv with that  and then captain cutler must have hurt himself with the dagger   hurt myself  exclaim the captain  with contempt   a silli littl scratch   which drew blood  repli the priest  nod   we know there  s blood on the brass now  and so we shall never know whether there was blood on it befor  there was a silenc  and then seymour said  with an emphasi quit alien to his daili accent   but i saw a man in the passag   i know you did  answer the cleric brown with a face of wood   so did captain cutler  that  s what seem so improb  befor either could make suffici sens of it even to answer  father brown had polit excus himself and gone stump up the road with his stumpi old umbrella  as modern newspap are conduct  the most honest and most import news is the polic news  if it be true that in the twentieth centuri more space is given to murder than to polit  it is for the excel reason that murder is a more serious subject  but even this would hard explain the enorm omnipres and wide distribut detail of  the bruno case  or  the passag mysteri  in the press of london and the provinc  so vast was the excit that for some week the press realli told the truth  and the report of examin and cross  examin  if intermin  even if intoler are at least reliabl  the true reason  of cours  was the coincid of person  the victim was a popular actress  the accus was a popular actor  and the accus had been caught red  hand  as it were  by the most popular soldier of the patriot season  in those extraordinari circumst the press was paralys into probiti and accuraci  and the rest of this somewhat singular busi can practic be record from report of bruno  s trial  the trial was presid over by mr justic monkhous  one of those who are jeer at as humor judg  but who are general much more serious than the serious judg  for their leviti come from a live impati of profession solemn  while the serious judg is realli fill with frivol  becaus he is fill with vaniti  all the chief actor be of a world import  the barrist were well balanc  the prosecutor for the crown was sir walter cowdray  a heavi  but weighti advoc of the sort that know how to seem english and trustworthi  and how to be rhetor with reluct  the prison was defend by mr patrick butler  k  c  who was mistaken for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the irish charact  and those who had not been examin by him  the medic evid involv no contradict  the doctor  whom seymour had summon on the spot  agre with the emin surgeon who had later examin the bodi  aurora rome had been stab with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger  some instrument  at least  of which the blade was short  the wound was just over the heart  and she had die instant  when the doctor first saw her she could hard have been dead for twenti minut  therefor when father brown found her she could hard have been dead for three  some offici detect evid follow  chiefli concern with the presenc or absenc of ani proof of a struggl  the onli suggest of this was the tear of the dress at the shoulder  and this did not seem to fit in particular well with the direct and final of the blow  when these detail had been suppli  though not explain  the first of the import wit was call  sir wilson seymour gave evid as he did everyth els that he did at all  not onli well  but perfect  though himself much more of a public man than the judg  he convey exact the fine shade of self  effac befor the king  s justic  and though everyon look at him as they would at the prime minist or the archbishop of canterburi  they could have said noth of his part in it but that it was that of a privat gentleman  with an accent on the noun  he was also refresh lucid  as he was on the committe  he had been call on miss rome at the theatr  he had met captain cutler there  they had been join for a short time by the accus  who had then return to his own dress  room  they had then been join by a roman cathol priest  who ask for the deceas ladi and said his name was brown  miss rome had then gone just outsid the theatr to the entranc of the passag  in order to point out to captain cutler a flower  shop at which he was to buy her some more flower  and the wit had remain in the room  exchang a few word with the priest  he had then distinct heard the deceas  have sent the captain on his errand  turn round laugh and run down the passag toward it other end  where was the prison  s dress  room  in idl curios as to the rapid movement of his friend  he had stroll out to the head of the passag himself and look down it toward the prison  s door  did he see anyth in the passag  yes  he saw someth in the passag  sir walter cowdray allow an impress interv  dure which the wit look down  and for all his usual composur seem to have more than his usual pallor  then the barrist said in a lower voic  which seem at onc sympathet and creepi   did you see it distinct  sir wilson seymour  howev move  had his excel brain in full work  order   veri distinct as regard it outlin  but quit indistinct  inde not at all  as regard the detail insid the outlin  the passag is of such length that anyon in the middl of it appear quit black against the light at the other end  the wit lower his steadi eye onc more and ad   i had notic the fact befor  when captain cutler first enter it  there was anoth silenc  and the judg lean forward and made a note   well  said sir walter patient   what was the outlin like  was it  for instanc  like the figur of the murder woman   not in the least  answer seymour quiet   what did it look like to you   it look to me  repli the wit   like a tall man  everyon in court kept his eye rivet on his pen  or his umbrella  handl  or his book  or his boot or whatev he happen to be look at  they seem to be hold their eye away from the prison by main forc  but they felt his figur in the dock  and they felt it as gigant  tall as bruno was to the eye  he seem to swell taller and taller when an eye had been torn away from him  cowdray was resum his seat with his solemn face  smooth his black silk robe  and white silk whisker  sir wilson was leav the wit  box  after a few final particular to which there were mani other wit  when the counsel for the defenc sprang up and stop him   i shall onli detain you a moment  said mr butler  who was a rustic  look person with red eyebrow and an express of partial slumber   will you tell his lordship how you knew it was a man  a faint  refin smile seem to pass over seymour  s featur   i  m afraid it is the vulgar test of trouser  he said   when i saw daylight between the long leg i was sure it was a man  after all  butler  s sleepi eye open as sudden as some silent explos   after all  he repeat slowli   so you did think at first it was a woman  seymour look troubl for the first time   it is hard a point of fact  he said   but if his lordship would like me to answer for my impress  of cours i shall do so  there was someth about the thing that was not exact a woman and yet was not quit a man  somehow the curv were differ  and it had someth that look like long hair   thank you  said mr butler  k  c  and sat down sudden  as if he had got what he want  captain cutler was a far less plausibl and compos wit than sir wilson  but his account of the open incid was solid the same  he describ the return of bruno to his dress  room  the dispatch of himself to buy a bunch of lili  of  the  valley  his return to the upper end of the passag  the thing he saw in the passag  his suspicion of seymour  and his struggl with bruno  but he could give littl artist assist about the black figur that he and seymour had seen  ask about it outlin  he said he was no art critic  with a somewhat too obvious sneer at seymour  ask if it was a man or a woman  he said it look more like a beast  with a too obvious snarl at the prison  but the man was plain shaken with sorrow and sincer anger  and cowdray quick excus him from confirm fact that were alreadi fair clear  the defend counsel also was again brief in his cross  examin  although  as was his custom  even in be brief  he seem to take a long time about it   you use a rather remark express  he said  look at cutler sleepili   what do you mean by say that it look more like a beast than a man or a woman  cutler seem serious agit   perhap i oughtn  t to have said that  he said   but when the brute has huge hump shoulder like a chimpanze  and bristl stick out of it head like a pig  mr butler cut short his curious impati in the middl   never mind whether it hair was like a pig  s  he said   was it like a woman  s   a woman  s  cri the soldier   great scott  no   the last wit said it was  comment the counsel  with unscrupul swift   and did the figur have ani of those serpentin and semi  feminin curv to which eloqu allus has been made  no  no feminin curv  the figur  if i understand you  was rather heavi and squar than otherwis   he may have been bend forward  said cutler  in a hoars and rather faint voic   or again  he may not  said mr butler  and sat down sudden for the second time  the third  wit call by sir walter cowdray was the littl cathol clergyman  so littl  compar with the other  that his head seem hard to come abov the box  so that it was like cross  examin a child  but unfortun sir walter had somehow got it into his head  most by some ramif of his famili  s religion  that father brown was on the side of the prison  becaus the prison was wick and foreign and even part black  therefor he took father brown up sharpli whenev that proud pontiff tri to explain anyth  and told him to answer yes or no  and tell the plain fact without ani jesuitri  when father brown began  in his simplic  to say who he thought the man in the passag was  the barrist told him that he did not want his theori   a black shape was seen in the passag  and you say you saw the black shape  well  what shape was it  father brown blink as under rebuk  but he had long known the liter natur of obedi   the shape  he said   was short and thick  but had two sharp  black project curv upward on each side of the head or top  rather like horn  and   oh  the devil with horn  no doubt  ejacul cowdray  sit down in triumphant jocular   it was the devil come to eat protest   no  said the priest dispassion   i know who it was  those in court had been wrought up to an irrat  but real sens of some monstros  they had forgotten the figur in the dock and thought onli of the figur in the passag  and the figur in the passag  describ by three capabl and respect men who had all seen it  was a shift nightmar  one call it a woman  and the other a beast  and the other a devil  the judg was look at father brown with level and pierc eye   you are a most extraordinari wit  he said   but there is someth about you that make me think you are tri to tell the truth  well  who was the man you saw in the passag   he was myself  said father brown  butler  k  c  sprang to his feet in an extraordinari still  and said quit calm   your lordship will allow me to cross  examin  and then  without stop  he shot at brown the appar disconnect question   you have heard about this dagger  you know the expert say the crime was commit with a short blade   a short blade  assent brown  nod solemn like an owl   but a veri long hilt  befor the audienc could quit dismiss the idea that the priest had realli seen himself do murder with a short dagger with a long hilt  which seem somehow to make it more horribl  he had himself hurri on to explain   i mean dagger aren  t the onli thing with short blade  spear have short blade  and spear catch at the end of the steel just like dagger  if they  re that sort of fanci spear they had in theatr  like the spear poor old parkinson kill his wife with  just when she  d sent for me to settl their famili troubl  and i came just too late  god forgiv me  but he die penit  he just die of be penit  he couldn  t bear what he  d done  the general impress in court was that the littl priest  who was gobbl away  had liter gone mad in the box  but the judg still look at him with bright and steadi eye of interest  and the counsel for the defenc went on with his question unperturb   if parkinson did it with that pantomim spear  said butler   he must have thrust from four yard away  how do you account for sign of struggl  like the dress drag off the shoulder  he had slip into treat his mere wit as an expert  but no one notic it now   the poor ladi  s dress was torn  said the wit   becaus it was caught in a panel that slid to just behind her  she struggl to free herself  and as she did so parkinson came out of the prison  s room and lung with the spear   a panel  repeat the barrist in a curious voic   it was a look  glass on the other side  explain father brown   when i was in the dress  room i notic that some of them could probabl be slid out into the passag  there was anoth vast and unnatur silenc  and this time it was the judg who spoke   so you realli mean that when you look down that passag  the man you saw was yourself  in a mirror   yes  my lord  that was what i was tri to say  said brown   but they ask me for the shape  and our hat have corner just like horn  and so i  the judg lean forward  his old eye yet more brilliant  and said in special distinct tone   do you realli mean to say that when sir wilson seymour saw that wild what  you  call  him with curv and a woman  s hair and a man  s trouser  what he saw was sir wilson seymour   yes  my lord  said father brown   and you mean to say that when captain cutler saw that chimpanze with hump shoulder and hog  s bristl  he simpli saw himself   yes  my lord  the judg lean back in his chair with a luxuri in which it was hard to separ the cynic and the admir   and can you tell us whi  he ask   you should know your own figur in a look  glass  when two such distinguish men don  t  father brown blink even more pain than befor  then he stammer   realli  my lord  i don  t know unless it  s becaus i don  t look at it so often  v  the mistak of the machin flambeau and his friend the priest were sit in the templ garden about sunset  and their neighbourhood or some such accident influenc had turn their talk to matter of legal process  from the problem of the licenc in cross  examin  their talk stray to roman and mediaev tortur  to the examin magistr in franc and the third degre in america   i  ve been read  said flambeau   of this new psychometr method they talk about so much  especi in america  you know what i mean  they put a pulsomet on a man  s wrist and judg by how his heart goe at the pronunci of certain word  what do you think of it   i think it veri interest  repli father brown   it remind me of that interest idea in the dark age that blood would flow from a corps if the murder touch it   do you realli mean  demand his friend   that you think the two method equal valuabl   i think them equal valueless  repli brown   blood flow  fast or slow  in dead folk or live  for so mani more million reason than we can ever know  blood will have to flow veri funnili  blood will have to flow up the matterhorn  befor i will take it as a sign that i am to shed it   the method  remark the other   has been guarante by some of the greatest american men of scienc   what sentimentalist men of scienc are  exclaim father brown   and how much more sentiment must american men of scienc be  who but a yanke would think of prove anyth from heart  throb  whi  they must be as sentiment as a man who think a woman is in love with him if she blush  that  s a test from the circul of the blood  discov by the immort harvey  and a jolli rotten test  too   but sure  insist flambeau   it might point pretti straight at someth or other   there  s a disadvantag in a stick point straight  answer the other   what is it  whi  the other end of the stick alway point the opposit way  it depend whether you get hold of the stick by the right end  i saw the thing done onc and i  ve never believ in it sinc  and he proceed to tell the stori of his disillusion  it happen near twenti year befor  when he was chaplain to his co  religionist in a prison in chicago  where the irish popul display a capac both for crime and penit which kept him toler busi  the offici second  in  command under the governor was an ex  detect name greywood usher  a cadaver  care  spoken yanke philosoph  occasion vari a veri rigid visag with an odd apologet grimac  he like father brown in a slight patron way  and father brown like him  though he heartili dislik his theori  his theori were extrem complic and were held with extrem simplic  one even he had sent for the priest  who  accord to his custom  took a seat in silenc at a tabl pile and litter with paper  and wait  the offici select from the paper a scrap of newspap cut  which he hand across to the cleric  who read it grave  it appear to be an extract from one of the pinkest of american societi paper  and ran as follow   societi  s brightest widow is onc more on the freak dinner stunt  all our exclus citizen will recal the perambul parad dinner  in which last  trick todd  at his palati home at pilgrim  s pond  caus so mani of our promin debutant to look even younger than their year  equal eleg and more miscellan and larg  heart in social outlook was last  trick  s show the year previous  the popular cannib crush lunch  at which the confect hand round were sarcast mould in the form of human arm and leg  and dure which more than one of our gayest mental gymnast was heard offer to eat his partner  the wittic which will inspir this even is as yet in mr todd  s pretti retic intellect  or lock in the jewel bosom of our citi  s gayest leader  but there is talk of a pretti parodi of the simpl manner and custom at the other end of societi  s scale  this would be all the more tell  as hospit todd is entertain in lord falconroy  the famous travel  a true  blood aristocrat fresh from england  s oak  grove  lord falconroy  s travel began befor his ancient feudal titl was resurrect  he was in the republ in his youth  and fashion murmur a sli reason for his return  miss etta todd is one of our deep  soul new yorker  and come into an incom of near twelv hundr million dollar   well  ask usher   doe that interest you   whi  word rather fail me  answer father brown   i cannot think at this moment of anyth in this world that would interest me less  and  unless the just anger of the republ is at last go to electrocut journalist for write like that  i don  t quit see whi it should interest you either   ah  said mr usher dryli  and hand across anoth scrap of newspap   well  doe that interest you  the paragraph was head  savag murder of a warder  convict escap  and ran   just befor dawn this morn a shout for help was heard in the convict settlement at sequah in this state  the author  hurri in the direct of the cri  found the corps of the warder who patrol the top of the north wall of the prison  the steepest and most difficult exit  for which one man has alway been found suffici  the unfortun offic had  howev  been hurl from the high wall  his brain beaten out as with a club  and his gun was miss  further inquiri show that one of the cell was empti  it had been occupi by a rather sullen ruffian give his name as oscar rian  he was onli temporarili detain for some compar trivial assault  but he gave everyon the impress of a man with a black past and a danger futur  final  when daylight bad fulli reveal the scene of murder  it was found that he had written on the wall abov the bodi a fragmentari sentenc  appar with a finger dip in blood   this was self  defenc and he had the gun  i meant no harm to him or ani man but one  i am keep the bullet for pilgrim  s pond  o  r  a man must have use most fiendish treacheri or most savag and amaz bodili dare to have storm such a wall in spite of an arm man   well  the literari style is somewhat improv  admit the priest cheer   but still i don  t see what i can do for you  i should cut a poor figur  with my short leg  run about this state after an athlet assassin of that sort  i doubt whether anybodi could find him  the convict settlement at sequah is thirti mile from here  the countri between is wild and tangl enough  and the countri beyond  where he will sure have the sens to go  is a perfect no  man  s land tumbl away to the prairi  he may be in ani hole or up ani tree   he isn  t in ani hole  said the governor   he isn  t up ani tree   whi  how do you know  ask father brown  blink   would you like to speak to him  inquir usher  father brown open his innoc eye wide   he is here  he exclaim   whi  how did your men get hold of him   i got hold of him myself  drawl the american  rise and lazili stretch his lanki leg befor the fire   i got hold of him with the crook end of a walk  stick  don  t look so surpris  i realli did  you know i sometim take a turn in the countri lane outsid this dismal place  well  i was walk earli this even up a steep lane with dark hedg and grey  look plough field on both side  and a young moon was up and silver the road  by the light of it i saw a man run across the field toward the road  run with his bodi bent and at a good mile  race trot  he appear to be much exhaust  but when he came to the thick black hedg he went through it as if it were made of spider  web   or rather  for i heard the strong branch break and snap like bayonet  as if he himself were made of stone  in the instant in which he appear up against the moon  cross the road  i slung my hook cane at his leg  trip him and bring him down  then i blew my whistl long and loud  and our fellow came run up to secur him   it would have been rather awkward  remark brown   if you had found he was a popular athlet practis a mile race   he was not  said usher grim   we soon found out who he was  but i had guess it with the first glint of the moon on him   you thought it was the runaway convict  observ the priest simpli   becaus you had read in the newspap cut that morn that a convict had run away   i had somewhat better ground  repli the governor coolli   i pass over the first as too simpl to be emphas  i mean that fashion athlet do not run across plough field or scratch their eye out in brambl hedg  nor do they run all doubl up like a crouch dog  there were more decis detail to a fair well  train eye  the man was clad in coars and rag cloth  but they were someth more than mere coars and rag  they were so ill  fit as to be quit grotesqu  even as he appear in black outlin against the moonris  the coat  collar in which his head was buri made him look like a hunchback  and the long loos sleev look as if he had no hand  it at onc occur to me that he had somehow manag to chang his convict cloth for some confeder  s cloth which did not fit him  second  there was a pretti stiff wind against which he was run  so that i must have seen the streaki look of blow hair  if the hair had not been veri short  then i rememb that beyond these plough field he was cross lay pilgrim  s pond  for which  you will rememb  the convict was keep his bullet  and i sent my walk  stick fli   a brilliant piec of rapid deduct  said father brown   but had he got a gun  as usher stop abrupt in his walk the priest ad apologet   i  ve been told a bullet is not half so use without it   he had no gun  said the other grave   but that was doubtless due to some veri natur mischanc or chang of plan  probabl the same polici that made him chang the cloth made him drop the gun  he began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood of his victim   well  that is possibl enough  answer the priest   and it  s hard worth specul on  said usher  turn to some other paper   for we know it  s the man by this time  his cleric friend ask faint   but how  and greywood usher threw down the newspap and took up the two press  cut again   well  sinc you are so obstin  he said   let  s begin at the begin  you will notic that these two cut have onli one thing in common  which is the mention of pilgrim  s pond  the estat  as you know  of the millionair ireton todd  you also know that he is a remark charact  one of those that rose on step  stone   of our dead selv to higher thing  assent his companion   yes  i know that  petroleum  i think   anyhow  said usher   last  trick todd count for a great deal in this rum affair  he stretch himself onc more befor the fire and continu talk in his expans  radiant explanatori style   to begin with  on the face of it  there is no mysteri here at all  it is not mysteri  it is not even odd  that a jailbird should take his gun to pilgrim  s pond  our peopl aren  t like the english  who will forgiv a man for be rich if he throw away money on hospit or hors  last  trick todd has made himself big by his own consider abil  and there  s no doubt that mani of those on whom he has shown his abil would like to show their on him with a shot  gun  todd might easili get drop by some man he  d never even heard of  some labour he  d lock out  or some clerk in a busi he  d bust  last  trick is a man of mental endow and a high public charact  but in this countri the relat of employ and employ are consider strain   that  s how the whole thing look suppos this rian made for pilgrim  s pond to kill todd  so it look to me  till anoth littl discoveri woke up what i have of the detect in me  when i had my prison safe  i pick up my cane again and stroll down the two or three turn of countri road that brought me to one of the side entranc of todd  s ground  the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place is name  it was some two hour ago  about seven by this time  the moonlight was more lumin  and i could see the long white streak of it lie on the mysteri mere with it grey  greasi  half  liquid shore in which they say our father use to make witch walk until they sank  i  d forgotten the exact tale  but you know the place i mean  it lie north of todd  s hous toward the wilder  and has two queer wrinkl tree  so dismal that they look more like huge fungoid than decent foliag  as i stood peer at this misti pool  i fanci i saw the faint figur of a man move from the hous toward it  but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact  and still less of the detail  besid  my attent was veri sharpli arrest by someth much closer  i crouch behind the fenc which ran not more than two hundr yard from one wing of the great mansion  and which was fortun split in place  as if special for the applic of a cautious eye  a door had open in the dark bulk of the left wing  and a figur appear black against the illumin interior  a muffl figur bend forward  evid peer out into the night  it close the door behind it  and i saw it was carri a lantern  which threw a patch of imperfect light on the dress and figur of the wearer  it seem to be the figur of a woman  wrap up in a rag cloak and evid disguis to avoid notic  there was someth veri strang both about the rag and the furtiv in a person come out of those room line with gold  she took cautious the curv garden path which brought her within half a hundr yard of me  then she stood up for an instant on the terrac of turf that look toward the slimi lake  and hold her flame lantern abov her head she deliber swung it three time to and fro as for a signal  as she swung it the second time a flicker of it light fell for a moment on her own face  a face that i knew  she was unnatur pale  and her head was bundl in her borrow plebeian shawl  but i am certain it was etta todd  the millionair  s daughter   she retrac her step in equal secreci and the door close behind her again  i was about to climb the fenc and follow  when i realiz that the detect fever that had lure me into the adventur was rather undignifi  and that in a more authorit capac i alreadi held all the card in my hand  i was just turn away when a new nois broke on the night  a window was thrown up in one of the upper floor  but just round the corner of the hous so that i could not see it  and a voic of terribl distinct was heard shout across the dark garden to know where lord falconroy was  for he was miss from everi room in the hous  there was no mistak that voic  i have heard it on mani a polit platform or meet of director  it was ireton todd himself  some of the other seem to have gone to the lower window or on to the step  and were call up to him that falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the pilgrim  s pond an hour befor  and could not be trace sinc  then todd cri  mighti murder  and shut down the window violent  and i could hear him plung down the stair insid  repossess myself of my former and wiser purpos  i whip out of the way of the general search that must follow  and return here not later than eight o  clock   i now ask you to recal that littl societi paragraph which seem to you so pain lack in interest  if the convict was not keep the shot for todd  as he evid wasn  t  it is most like that he was keep it for lord falconroy  and it look as if he had deliv the good  no more handi place to shoot a man than in the curious geolog surround of that pool  where a bodi thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth practic unknown  let us suppos  then  that our friend with the crop hair came to kill falconroy and not todd  but  as i have point out  there are mani reason whi peopl in america might want to kill todd  there is no reason whi anybodi in america should want to kill an english lord newli land  except for the one reason mention in the pink paper  that the lord is pay his attent to the millionair  s daughter  our crop  hair friend  despit his ill  fit cloth  must be an aspir lover   i know the notion will seem to you jar and even comic  but that  s becaus you are english  it sound to you like say the archbishop of canterburi  s daughter will be marri in st georg  s  hanov squar  to a cross  sweeper on ticket  of  leav  you don  t do justic to the climb and aspir power of our more remark citizen  you see a good  look grey  hair man in even  dress with a sort of author about him  you know he is a pillar of the state  and you fanci he had a father  you are in error  you do not realiz that a compar few year ago he may have been in a tenement or  quit like  in a jail  you don  t allow for our nation buoyanc and uplift  mani of our most influenti citizen have not onli risen recent  but risen compar late in life  todd  s daughter was fulli eighteen when her father first made his pile  so there isn  t realli anyth imposs in her have a hanger  on in low life  or even in her hang on to him  as i think she must be do  to judg by the lantern busi  if so  the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnect with the hand that held the gun  this case  sir  will make a nois   well  said the priest patient   and what did you do next   i reckon you  ll be shock  repli greywood usher   as i know you don  t cotton to the march of scienc in these matter  i am given a good deal of discret here  and perhap take a littl more than i  m given  and i thought it was an excel opportun to test that psychometr machin i told you about  now  in my opinion  that machin can  t lie   no machin can lie  said father brown   nor can it tell the truth   it did in this case  as i  ll show you  went on usher posit   i sat the man in the ill  fit cloth in a comfort chair  and simpli wrote word on a blackboard  and the machin simpli record the variat of his puls  and i simpli observ his manner  the trick is to introduc some word connect with the suppos crime in a list of word connect with someth quit differ  yet a list in which it occur quit natur  thus i wrote  heron  and  eagl  and  owl  and when i wrote  falcon  he was tremend agit  and when i began to make an  r  at the end of the word  that machin just bound  who els in this republ has ani reason to jump at the name of a newli  arriv englishman like falconroy except the man who  s shot him  isn  t that better evid than a lot of gabbl from wit  if the evid of a reliabl machin   you alway forget  observ his companion   that the reliabl machin alway has to be work by an unreli machin   whi  what do you mean  ask the detect   i mean man  said father brown   the most unreli machin i know of  i don  t want to be rude  and i don  t think you will consid man to be an offens or inaccur descript of yourself  you say you observ his manner  but how do you know you observ it right  you say the word have to come in a natur way  but how do you know that you did it natur  how do you know  if you come to that  that he did not observ your manner  who is to prove that you were not tremend agit  there was no machin tie on to your puls   i tell you  cri the american in the utmost excit   i was as cool as a cucumb   crimin also can be as cool as cucumb  said brown with a smile   and almost as cool as you   well  this one wasn  t  said usher  throw the paper about   oh  you make me tire   i  m sorri  said the other   i onli point out what seem a reason possibl  if you could tell by his manner when the word that might hang him had come  whi shouldn  t he tell from your manner that the word that might hang him was come  i should ask for more than word myself befor i hang anybodi  usher smote the tabl and rose in a sort of angri triumph   and that  he cri   is just what i  m go to give you  i tri the machin first just in order to test the thing in other way afterward and the machin  sir  is right  he paus a moment and resum with less excit   i rather want to insist  if it come to that  that so far i had veri littl to go on except the scientif experi  there was realli noth against the man at all  his cloth were ill  fit  as i  ve said  but they were rather better  if anyth  than those of the submerg class to which he evid belong  moreov  under all the stain of his plung through plough field or burst through dusti hedg  the man was compar clean  this might mean  of cours  that he had onli just broken prison  but it remind me more of the desper decenc of the compar respect poor  his demeanour was  i am bound to confess  quit in accord with their  he was silent and dignifi as they are  he seem to have a big  but buri  grievanc  as they do  he profess total ignor of the crime and the whole question  and show noth but a sullen impati for someth sensibl that might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape  he ask me more than onc if he could telephon for a lawyer who had help him a long time ago in a trade disput  and in everi sens act as you would expect an innoc man to act  there was noth against him in the world except that littl finger on the dial that point to the chang of his puls   then  sir  the machin was on it trial  and the machin was right  by the time i came with him out of the privat room into the vestibul where all sort of other peopl were await examin  i think he had alreadi more or less made up his mind to clear thing up by someth like a confess  he turn to me and began to say in a low voic   oh  i can  t stick this ani more  if you must know all about me   at the same instant one of the poor women sit on the long bench stood up  scream aloud and point at him with her finger  i have never in my life heard anyth more demoniac distinct  her lean finger seem to pick him out as if it were a pea  shooter  though the word was a mere howl  everi syllabl was as clear as a separ stroke on the clock   drugger davi  she shout   they  ve got drugger davi   among the wretch women  most thiev and streetwalk  twenti face were turn  gape with glee and hate  if i had never heard the word  i should have known by the veri shock upon his featur that the so  call oscar rian had heard his real name  but i  m not quit so ignor  you may be surpris to hear  drugger davi was one of the most terribl and deprav crimin that ever baffl our polic  it is certain he had done murder more than onc long befor his last exploit with the warder  but he was never entir fix for it  curious enough becaus he did it in the same manner as those milder  or meaner  crime for which he was fix pretti often  he was a handsom  well  bred  look brute  as he still is  to some extent  and he use most to go about with barmaid or shop  girl and do them out of their money  veri often  though  he went a good deal farther  and they were found drug with cigarett or chocol and their whole properti miss  then came one case where the girl was found dead  but deliber could not quit be prove  and  what was more practic still  the crimin could not be found  i heard a rumour of his have reappear somewher in the opposit charact this time  lend money instead of borrow it  but still to such poor widow as he might person fascin  but still with the same bad result for them  well  there is your innoc man  and there is his innoc record  even  sinc then  four crimin and three warder have identifi him and confirm the stori  now what have you got to say to my poor littl machin after that  hasn  t the machin done for him  or do you prefer to say that the woman and i have done for him   as to what you  ve done for him  repli father brown  rise and shake himself in a floppi way   you  ve save him from the electr chair  i don  t think they can kill drugger davi on that old vagu stori of the poison  and as for the convict who kill the warder  i suppos it  s obvious that you haven  t got him  mr davi is innoc of that crime  at ani rate   what do you mean  demand the other   whi should he be innoc of that crime   whi  bless us all  cri the small man in one of his rare moment of anim   whi  becaus he  s guilti of the other crime  i don  t know what you peopl are made of  you seem to think that all sin are kept togeth in a bag  you talk as if a miser on monday were alway a spendthrift on tuesday  you tell me this man you have here spent week and month wheedl needi women out of small sum of money  that he use a drug at the best  and a poison at the worst  that he turn up afterward as the lowest kind of moneylend  and cheat most poor peopl in the same patient and pacif style  let it be grant  let us admit  for the sake of argument  that he did all this  if that is so  i will tell you what he didn  t do  he didn  t storm a spike wall against a man with a load gun  he didn  t write on the wall with his own hand  to say he had done it  he didn  t stop to state that his justif was self  defenc  he didn  t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder  he didn  t name the hous of the rich man to which he was go with the gun  he didn  t write his own  initi in a man  s blood  saint aliv  can  t you see the whole charact is differ  in good and evil  whi  you don  t seem to be like i am a bit  one would think you  d never had ani vice of your own  the amaz american had alreadi part his lip in protest when the door of his privat and offici room was hammer and rattl in an unceremoni way to which he was total unaccustom  the door flew open  the moment befor greywood usher had been come to the conclus that father brown might possibl be mad  the moment after he began to think he was mad himself  there burst and fell into his privat room a man in the filthiest rag  with a greasi squash hat still askew on his head  and a shabbi green shade shove up from one of his eye  both of which were glare like a tiger  s  the rest of his face was almost undiscover  be mask with a mat beard and whisker through which the nose could bare thrust itself  and further buri in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief  mr usher pride himself on have seen most of the roughest specimen in the state  but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dress as a scarecrow as this  but  abov all  he had never in all his placid scientif exist heard a man like that speak to him first   see here  old man usher  shout the be in the red handkerchief   i  m get tire  don  t you tri ani of your hide  and  seek on me  i don  t get fool ani  leav go of my guest  and i  ll let up on the fanci clockwork  keep him here for a split instant and you  ll feel pretti mean  i reckon i  m not a man with no pull  the emin usher was regard the bellow monster with an amaz which had dri up all other sentiment  the mere shock to his eye had render his ear  almost useless  at last he rang a bell with a hand of violenc  while the bell was still strong and peal  the voic of father brown fell soft but distinct   i have a suggest to make  he said   but it seem a littl confus  i don  t know this gentleman  but  but i think i know him  now  you know him  you know him quit well  but you don  t know him  natur  sound paradox  i know   i reckon the cosmos is crack  said usher  and fell asprawl in his round offic chair   now  see here  vocifer the stranger  strike the tabl  but speak in a voic that was all the more mysteri becaus it was compar mild and ration though still resound   i won  t let you in  i want   who in hell are you  yell usher  sudden sit up straight   i think the gentleman  s name is todd  said the priest  then he pick up the pink slip of newspap   i fear you don  t read the societi paper proper  he said  and began to read out in a

telescop length and changeless continu  the pilgrim walk down it begin to think he will never come to a break or a corner  but there is one except  a veri small one  but hail by the pilgrim almost with a shout  there is a sort of mew between two of the tall mansion  a mere slit like the crack of a door by comparison with the street  but just larg enough to permit a pigmi ale  hous or eat  hous  still allow by the rich to their stabl  servant  to stand in the angl  there is someth cheeri in it veri dingi  and someth free and elfin in it veri insignific  at the feet of those grey stone giant

letter  half hid the interior from the street  and a face peer out not unlik a rather innoc goblin  s  it was  in fact  the face of one with the harmless human name of brown  former priest of cobhol in essex  and now work in london  his friend  flambeau  a semi  offici investig  was sit opposit him  make his last note of a case he had clear up in the neighbourhood  they were sit at a small tabl  close up to the window  when the priest pull the curtain back and look out  he wait till a stranger in the street had pass the window  to let the curtain fall into it place again  then his round eye roll to the larg white letter on the window abov his head  and then stray to the next tabl  at which sat onli a navvi with beer and chees  and a young girl with red hair and a glass of milk  then  see his friend put away the pocket  book  he said soft   if you  ve got ten minut  i wish you  d follow that man with the fals nose  flambeau look up in surpris  but the girl with the red hair also look up  and with someth that was stronger than astonish  she was simpli and even loos dress in light brown sack stuff  but she was a ladi  and even  on a second glanc  a rather needless haughti one   the man with the fals nose  repeat flambeau   who  s he   i haven  t a notion  answer father brown   i want you to find out  i ask it as a favour  he went down there  and he jerk his thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguish gestur   and can  t have pass three lamp  post yet  i onli want to know the direct  flambeau gaze at his friend for some time  with an express between perplex and amus  and then  rise from the tabl  squeez his huge form out of the littl door of the dwarf tavern  and melt into the twilight  father brown took a small book out of his pocket and began to read steadili  he betray no conscious of the fact that the red  hair ladi had left her own tabl and sat down opposit him  at last she lean over and said in a low  strong voic   whi do you say that  how do you know it  s fals  he lift his rather heavi eyelid  which flutter in consider embarrass  then his dubious eye roam again to the white letter on the glass front of the public  hous  the young woman  s eye follow his  and rest there also  but in pure puzzledom   no  said father brown  answer her thought   it doesn  t say  sela  like the thing in the psalm  i read it like that myself when i was wool  gather just now  it say  ale   well  inquir the stare young ladi   what doe it matter what it say  his rumin eye rove to the girl  s light canva sleev  round the wrist of which ran a veri slight thread of artist pattern  just enough to distinguish it from a work  dress of a common woman and make it more like the work  dress of a ladi art  student  he seem to find much food for thought in this  but his repli was veri slow and hesit   you see  madam  he said   from outsid the place look  well  it is a perfect decent place  but ladi like you don  t  don  t general think so  they never go into such place from choic  except   well  she repeat   except an unfortun few who don  t go in to drink milk   you are a most singular person  said the young ladi   what is your object in all this   not to troubl you about it  he repli  veri gentl   onli to arm myself with knowledg enough to help you  if ever you freeli ask my help   but whi should i need help  he continu his dreami monologu   you couldn  t have come in to see protege  humbl friend  that sort of thing  or you  d have gone through into the parlour  and you couldn  t have come in becaus you were ill  or you  d have spoken to the woman of the place  who  s obvious respect  besid  you don  t look ill in that way  but onli unhappi  this street is the onli origin long lane that has no turn  and the hous on both side are shut up  i could onli suppos that you  d seen somebodi come whom you didn  t want to meet  and found the public  hous was the onli shelter in this wilder of stone  i don  t think i went beyond the licenc of a stranger in glanc at the onli man who pass immedi after  and as i thought he look like the wrong sort  and you look like the right sort  i held myself readi to help if he annoy you  that is all  as for my friend  he  ll be back soon  and he certain can  t find out anyth by stump down a road like this  i didn  t think he could   then whi did you send him out  she cri  lean forward with yet warmer curios  she had the proud  impetu face that goe with reddish colour  and a roman nose  as it did in mari antoinett  he look at her steadili for the first time  and said   becaus i hope you would speak to me  she look back at him for some time with a heat face  in which there hung a red shadow of anger  then  despit her anxieti  humour broke out of her eye and the corner of her mouth  and she answer almost grim   well  if you  re so keen on my convers  perhap you  ll answer my question  after a paus she ad   i had the honour to ask you whi you thought the man  s nose was fals   the wax alway spot like that just a littl in this weather  answer father brown with entir simplic   but it  s such a crook nose  remonstr the red  hair girl  the priest smile in his turn   i don  t say it  s the sort of nose one would wear out of mere fopperi  he admit   this man  i think  wear it becaus his real nose is so much nicer   but whi  she insist   what is the nurseri  rhyme  observ brown absent  mind   there was a crook man and he went a crook mile  that man  i fanci  has gone a veri crook road  by follow his nose   whi  what  s he done  she demand  rather shakili   i don  t want to forc your confid by a hair  said father brown  veri quiet   but i think you could tell me more about that than i can tell you  the girl sprang to her feet and stood quit quiet  but with clench hand  like one about to stride away  then her hand loosen slowli  and she sat down again   you are more of a mysteri than all the other  she said desper   but i feel there might be a heart in your mysteri   what we all dread most  said the priest in a low voic   is a maze with no centr  that is whi atheism is onli a nightmar   i will tell you everyth  said the red  hair girl dog   except whi i am tell you  and that i don  t know  she pick at the darn tabl  cloth and went on   you look as if you knew what isn  t snobberi as well as what is  and when i say that our is a good old famili  you  ll understand it is a necessari part of the stori  inde  my chief danger is in my brother  s high  and  dri notion  nobless oblig and all that  well  my name is christabel carstair  and my father was that colonel carstair you  ve probabl heard of  who made the famous carstair collect of roman coin  i could never describ my father to you  the nearest i can say is that he was veri like a roman coin himself  he was as handsom and as genuin and as valuabl and as metal and as out  of  date  he was prouder of his collect than of his coat  of  arm  nobodi could say more than that  his extraordinari charact came out most in his will  he had two son and one daughter  he quarrel with one son  my brother gile  and sent him to australia on a small allow  he then made a will leav the carstair collect  actual with a yet smaller allow  to my brother arthur  he meant it as a reward  as the highest honour he could offer  in acknowledg of arthur  s loyalti and rectitud and the distinct he had alreadi gain in mathemat and econom at cambridg  he left me practic all his pretti larg fortun  and i am sure he meant it in contempt   arthur  you may say  might well complain of this  but arthur is my father over again  though he had some differ with my father in earli youth  no sooner had he taken over the collect than he becam like a pagan priest dedic to a templ  he mix up these roman halfpenc with the honour of the carstair famili in the same stiff  idolatr way as his father befor him  he act as if roman money must be guard by all the roman virtu  he took no pleasur  he spent noth on himself  he live for the collect  often he would not troubl to dress for his simpl meal  but patter about among the cord brown  paper parcel  which no one els was allow to touch  in an old brown dress  gown  with it rope and tassel and his pale  thin  refin face  it made him look like an old ascet monk  everi now and then  though  he would appear dress like a decid fashion gentleman  but that was onli when he went up to the london sale or shop to make an addit to the carstair collect   now  if you  ve known ani young peopl  you won  t be shock if i say that i got into rather a low frame of mind with all this  the frame of mind in which one begin to say that the ancient roman were all veri well in their way  i  m not like my brother arthur  i can  t help enjoy enjoy  i got a lot of romanc and rubbish where i got my red hair  from the other side of the famili  poor gile was the same  and i think the atmospher of coin might count in excus for him  though he realli did wrong and near went to prison  but he didn  t behav ani wors than i did  as you shall hear   i come now to the silli part of the stori  i think a man as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin to reliev the monotoni for an unruli girl of seventeen place in such a posit  but i am so rattl with more dread thing that i can hard read my own feel  and don  t know whether i despis it now as a flirtat or bear it as a broken heart  we live then at a littl seasid water  place in south wale  and a retir sea  captain live a few door off had a son about five year older than myself  who had been a friend of gile befor he went to the coloni  his name doe not affect my tale  but i tell you it was philip hawker  becaus i am tell you everyth  we use to go shrimp togeth  and said and thought we were in love with each other  at least he certain said he was  and i certain thought i was  if i tell you he had bronz cur hair and a falconish sort of face  bronz by the sea also  it  s not for his sake  i assur you  but for the stori  for it was the caus of a veri curious coincid   one summer afternoon  when i had promis to go shrimp along the sand with philip  i was wait rather impati in the front draw  room  watch arthur handl some packet of coin he had just purchas and slowli shunt them  one or two at a time  into his own dark studi and museum which was at the back of the hous  as soon as i heard the heavi door close on him final  i made a bolt for my shrimp  net and tam  o  shanter and was just go to slip out  when i saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay gleam on the long bench by the window  it was a bronz coin  and the colour  combin with the exact curv of the roman nose and someth in the veri lift of the long  wiri neck  made the head of caesar on it the almost precis portrait of philip hawker  then i sudden rememb gile tell philip of a coin that was like him  and philip wish he had it  perhap you can fanci the wild  foolish thought with which my head went round  i felt as if i had had a gift from the fairi  it seem to me that if i could onli run away with this  and give it to philip like a wild sort of wed  ring  it would be a bond between us for ever  i felt a thousand such thing at onc  then there yawn under me  like the pit  the enorm  aw notion of what i was do  abov all  the unbear thought  which was like touch hot iron  of what arthur would think of it  a carstair a thief  and a thief of the carstair treasur  i believ my brother could see me burn like a witch for such a thing  but then  the veri thought of such fanat cruelti heighten my old hatr of his dingi old antiquarian fussi and my long for the youth and liberti that call to me from the sea  outsid was strong sunlight with a wind  and a yellow head of some broom or gors in the garden rap against the glass of the window  i thought of that live and grow gold call to me from all the heath of the world  and then of that dead  dull gold and bronz and brass of my brother  s grow dustier and dustier as life went by  natur and the carstair collect had come to grip at last   natur is older than the carstair collect  as i ran down the street to the sea  the coin clench tight in my fist  i felt all the roman empir on my back as well as the carstair pedigre  it was not onli the old lion argent that was roar in my ear  but all the eagl of the caesar seem flap and scream in pursuit of me  and yet my heart rose higher and higher like a child  s kite  until i came over the loos  dri sand  hill and to the flat  wet sand  where philip stood alreadi up to his ankl in the shallow shine water  some hundr yard out to sea  there was a great red sunset  and the long stretch of low water  hard rise over the ankl for half a mile  was like a lake of rubi flame  it was not till i had torn off my shoe and stock and wade to where he stood  which was well away from the dri land  that i turn and look round  we were quit alon in a circl of sea  water and wet sand  and i gave him the head of caesar   at the veri instant i had a shock of fanci  that a man far away on the sand  hill was look at me intent  i must have felt immedi after that it was a mere leap of unreason nerv  for the man was onli a dark dot in the distanc  and i could onli just see that he was stand quit still and gaze  with his head a littl on one side  there was no earth logic evid that he was look at me  he might have been look at a ship  or the sunset  or the sea  gull  or at ani of the peopl who still stray here and there on the shore between us  nevertheless  whatev my start sprang from was prophet  for  as i gaze  he start walk brisk in a bee  line toward us across the wide wet sand  as he drew nearer and nearer i saw that he was dark and beard  and that his eye were mark with dark spectacl  he was dress poor but respect in black  from the old black top hat on his head to the solid black boot on his feet  in spite of these he walk straight into the sea without a flash of hesit  and came on at me with the steadi of a travel bullet   i can  t tell you the sens of monstros and miracl i had when he thus silent burst the barrier between land and water  it was as if he had walk straight off a cliff and still march steadili in mid  air  it was as if a hous had flown up into the sky or a man  s head had fallen off  he was onli wet his boot  but he seem to be a demon disregard a law of natur  if he had hesit an instant at the water  s edg it would have been noth  as it was  he seem to look so much at me alon as not to notic the ocean  philip was some yard away with his back to me  bend over his net  the stranger came on till he stood within two yard of me  the water wash half  way up to his knee  then he said  with a clear modul and rather minc articul   would it discommod you to contribut elsewher a coin with a somewhat differ superscript   with one except there was noth defin abnorm about him  his tint glass were not realli opaqu  but of a blue kind common enough  nor were the eye behind them shifti  but regard me steadili  his dark beard was not realli long or wild  but he look rather hairi  becaus the beard began veri high up in his face  just under the cheek  bone  his complexion was neither sallow nor livid  but on the contrari rather clear and youth  yet this gave a pink  and  white wax look which somehow  i don  t know whi  rather increas the horror  the onli odditi one could fix was that his nose  which was otherwis of a good shape  was just slight turn sideway at the tip  as if  when it was soft  it had been tap on one side with a toy hammer  the thing was hard a deform  yet i cannot tell you what a live nightmar it was to me  as he stood there in the sunset  stain water he affect me as some hellish sea  monster just risen roar out of a sea like blood  i don  t know whi a touch on the nose should affect my imagin so much  i think it seem as if he could move his nose like a finger  and as if he had just that moment move it   ani littl assist  he continu with the same queer  priggish accent   that may obviat the necess of my communic with the famili   then it rush over me that i was be blackmail for the theft of the bronz piec  and all my mere superstiti fear and doubt were swallow up in one overpow  practic question  how could he have found out  i had stolen the thing sudden and on impuls  i was certain alon  for i alway made sure of be unobserv when i slip out to see philip in this way  i had not  to all appear  been follow in the street  and if i had  they could not  x  ray  the coin in my close hand  the man stand on the sand  hill could no more have seen what i gave philip than shoot a fli in one eye  like the man in the fairi  tale   philip  i cri helpless   ask this man what he want   when philip lift his head at last from mend his net he look rather red  as if sulki or asham  but it may have been onli the exert of stoop and the red even light  i may have onli had anoth of the morbid fanci that seem to be danc about me  he mere said gruffli to the man   you clear out of this  and  motion me to follow  set off wade shoreward without pay further attent to him  he step on to a stone breakwat that ran out from among the root of the sand  hill  and so struck homeward  perhap think our incubus would find it less easi to walk on such rough stone  green and slipperi with seawe  than we  who were young and use to it  but my persecutor walk as daintili as he talk  and he still follow me  pick his way and pick his phrase  i heard his delic  detest voic appeal to me over my shoulder  until at last  when we had crest the sand  hill  philip  s patienc  which was by no mean so conspicu on most occas  seem to snap  he turn sudden  say   go back  i can  t talk to you now  and as the man hover and open his mouth  philip struck him a buffet on it that sent him fli from the top of the tallest sand  hill to the bottom  i saw him crawl out below  cover with sand   this stroke comfort me somehow  though it might well increas my peril  but philip show none of his usual elat at his own prowess  though as affection as ever  he still seem cast down  and befor i could ask him anyth fulli  he part with me at his own gate  with two remark that struck me as strang  he said that  all thing consid  i ought to put the coin back in the collect  but that he himself would keep it  for the present  and then he ad quit sudden and irrelev   you know gile is back from australia  the door of the tavern open and the gigant shadow of the investig flambeau fell across the tabl  father brown present him to the ladi in his own slight  persuas style of speech  mention his knowledg and sympathi in such case  and almost without know  the girl was soon reiter her stori to two listen  but flambeau  as he bow and sat down  hand the priest a small slip of paper  brown accept it with some surpris and read on it   cab to wagga wagga  379  mafek avenu  putney  the girl was go on with her stori   i went up the steep street to my own hous with my head in a whirl  it had not begun to clear when i came to the doorstep  on which i found a milk  can  and the man with the twist nose  the milk  can told me the servant were all out  for  of cours  arthur  brows about in his brown dress  gown in a brown studi  would not hear or answer a bell  thus there was no one to help me in the hous  except my brother  whose help must be my ruin  in desper i thrust two shill into the horrid thing  s hand  and told him to call again in a few day  when i had thought it out  he went off sulk  but more sheepish than i had expect  perhap he had been shaken by his fall  and i watch the star of sand splash on his back reced down the road with a horrid vindict pleasur  he turn a corner some six hous down   then i let myself in  made myself some tea  and tri to think it out  i sat at the draw  room window look on to the garden  which still glow with the last full even light  but i was too distract and dreami to look at the lawn and flower  pot and flower  bed with ani concentr  so i took the shock the more sharpli becaus i  d seen it so slowli   the man or monster i  d sent away was stand quit still in the middl of the garden  oh  we  ve all read a lot about pale  face phantom in the dark  but this was more dread than anyth of that kind could ever be  becaus  though he cast a long even shadow  he still stood in warm sunlight  and becaus his face was not pale  but had that waxen bloom still upon it that belong to a barber  s dummi  he stood quit still  with his face toward me  and i can  t tell you how horrid he look among the tulip and all those tall  gaudi  almost hothous  look flower  it look as if we  d stuck up a waxwork instead of a statu in the centr of our garden   yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turn and ran out of the garden by the back gate  which stood open and by which he had undoubt enter  this renew timid on his part was so differ from the impud with which he had walk into the sea  that i felt vagu comfort  i fanci  perhap  that he fear confront arthur more than i knew  anyhow  i settl down at last  and had a quiet dinner alon  for it was against the rule to disturb arthur when he was rearrang the museum  and  my thought  a littl releas  fled to philip and lost themselv  i suppos  anyhow  i was look blank  but rather pleasant than otherwis  at anoth window  uncurtain  but by this time black as a slate with the final night  fall  it seem to me that someth like a snail was on the outsid of the window  pane  but when i stare harder  it was more like a man  s thumb press on the pane  it had that curl look that a thumb has  with my fear and courag re  awaken togeth  i rush at the window and then recoil with a strangl scream that ani man but arthur must have heard   for it was not a thumb  ani more than it was a snail  it was the tip of a crook nose  crush against the glass  it look white with the pressur  and the stare face and eye behind it were at first invis and afterward grey like a ghost  i slam the shutter togeth somehow  rush up to my room and lock myself in  but  even as i pass  i could swear i saw a second black window with someth on it that was like a snail   it might be best to go to arthur after all  if the thing was crawl close all around the hous like a cat  it might have purpos wors even than blackmail  my brother might cast me out and curs me for ever  but he was a gentleman  and would defend me on the spot  after ten minut  curious think  i went down  knock on the door and then went in  to see the last and worst sight   my brother  s chair was empti  and he was obvious out  but the man with the crook nose was sit wait for his return  with his hat still insol on his head  and actual read one of my brother  s book under my brother  s lamp  his face was compos and occupi  but his nose  tip still had the air of be the most mobil part of his face  as if it had just turn from left to right like an eleph  s probosci  i had thought him poison enough while he was pursu and watch me  but i think his unconsci of my presenc was more fright still   i think i scream loud and long  but that doesn  t matter  what i did next doe matter  i gave him all the money i had  includ a good deal in paper which  though it was mine  i dare say i had no right to touch  he went off at last  with hate  tact regret all in long word  and i sat down  feel ruin in everi sens  and yet i was save that veri night by a pure accid  arthur had gone off sudden to london  as he so often did  for bargain  and return  late but radiant  have near secur a treasur that was an ad splendour even to the famili collect  he was so resplend that i was almost embolden to confess the abstract of the lesser gem  but he bore down all other topic with his over  power project  becaus the bargain might still misfir ani moment  he insist on my pack at onc and go up with him to lodg he had alreadi taken in fulham  to be near the curio  shop in question  thus in spite of myself  i fled from my foe almost in the dead of night  but from philip also  my brother was often at the south kensington museum  and  in order to make some sort of secondari life for myself  i paid for a few lesson at the art school  i was come back from them this even  when i saw the abomin of desol walk aliv down the long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said   i  ve got onli one thing to say  i don  t deserv to be help  and i don  t question or complain of my punish  it is just  it ought to have happen  but i still question  with burst brain  how it can have happen  am i punish by miracl  or how can anyon but philip and myself know i gave him a tini coin in the middl of the sea   it is an extraordinari problem  admit flambeau   not so extraordinari as the answer  remark father brown rather gloomili   miss carstair  will you be at home if we call at your fulham place in an hour and a half henc  the girl look at him  and then rose and put her glove on   yes  she said   i  ll be there  and almost instant left the place  that night the detect and the priest were still talk of the matter as they drew near the fulham hous  a tenement strang mean even for a temporari resid of the carstair famili   of cours the superfici  on reflect  said flambeau   would think first of this australian brother who  s been in troubl befor  who  s come back so sudden and who  s just the man to have shabbi confeder  but i can  t see how he can come into the thing by ani process of thought  unless   well  ask his companion patient  flambeau lower his voic   unless the girl  s lover come in  too  and he would be the blacker villain  the australian chap did know that hawker want the coin  but i can  t see how on earth he

friend   my god  cri flambeau   you don  t mean  an activ figur ran down the step of the hous and show under the golden lamplight the unmistak head that resembl the roman coin   miss carstair  said hawker without ceremoni   wouldn  t go in till you came   well  observ brown confid   don  t you think it  s the best thing she can do to stop outsid  with you to look after her  you see  i rather guess you have guess it all yourself   yes  said the young man  in an underton   i guess on the sand and now i know  that was whi i let him fall soft  take a latchkey from the girl and the coin from hawker  flambeau let himself and his friend into the empti hous and pass into the outer parlour  it was empti of all occup but one  the man whom father brown had seen pass the tavern was stand against the wall as if at bay  unchang  save that he had taken off his black coat and was wear a brown dress  gown   we have come  said father brown polit   to give back this coin to it owner  and he hand it to the man with the nose  flambeau  s eye roll   is this man a coin  collector  he ask   this man is mr arthur carstair  said the priest posit   and he is a coin  collector of a somewhat singular kind  the man chang colour so horribl that the crook nose stood out on his face like a separ and comic thing  he spoke  nevertheless  with a sort of despair digniti   you shall see  then  he said   that i have not lost all the famili qualiti  and he turn sudden and strode into an inner room  slam the door   stop him  shout father brown  bound and half fall over a chair  and  after a wrench or two  flambeau had the door open  but it was too late  in dead silenc flambeau strode across and telephon for doctor and polic  an empti medicin bottl lay on the floor  across the tabl the bodi of the man in the brown dress  gown lay amid his burst and gape brown  paper parcel  out of which pour and roll  not roman  but veri modern english coin  the priest held up the bronz head of caesar   this  he said   was all that was left of the carstair collect  after a silenc he went on  with more than common gentl   it was a cruel will his wick father made  and you see he did resent it a littl  he hate the roman money he had  and grew fonder of the real money deni him  he not onli sold the collect bit by bit  but sank bit by bit to the basest way of make money  even to blackmail his own famili in a disguis  he blackmail his brother from australia for his littl forgotten crime  that is whi he took the cab to wagga wagga in putney  he blackmail his sister for the theft he alon could have notic

quit close  there was anoth silenc   well  growl the detect   and so this great numismatist and coin  collector was noth but a vulgar miser   is there so great a differ  ask father brown  in the same strang  indulg tone   what is there wrong about a miser that is not often as wrong about a collector  what is wrong  except  thou shalt not make to thyself ani graven imag  thou shalt not bow down to them nor serv them  for i  but we must go and see how the poor young peopl are get on   i think  said flambeau   that in spite of everyth  they are probabl get on veri well  vii  the purpl wig mr edward nutt  the industri editor of the daili reform  sat at his desk  open letter and mark proof to the merri tune of a typewrit  work by a vigor young ladi  he was a stoutish  fair man  in his shirt  sleev  his movement were resolut  his mouth firm and his tone final  but his round  rather babyish blue eye had a bewild and even wist look that rather contradict all this  nor inde was the express altogeth mislead  it might truli be said of him  as for mani journalist in author  that his most familiar emot was one of continu fear  fear of libel action  fear of lost advertis  fear of misprint  fear of the sack  his life was a seri of distract compromis between the proprietor of the paper  and of him  who was a senil soap  boiler with three ineradic mistak in his mind  and the veri abl staff he had collect to run the paper  some of whom were brilliant and experienc men and  what was even wors  sincer enthusiast for the polit polici of the paper  a letter from one of these lay immedi befor him  and rapid and resolut as he was  he seem almost to hesit befor open it  he took up a strip of proof instead  ran down it with a blue eye  and a blue pencil  alter the word  adulteri  to the word  improprieti  and the word  jew  to the word  alien  rang a bell and sent it fli upstair  then  with a more thought eye  he rip open the letter from his more distinguish contributor  which bore a postmark of devonshir  and read as follow  dear nutt  as i see you  re work spook and dook at the same time  what about an articl on that rum busi of the eyr of exmoor  or as the old women call it down here  the devil  s ear of eyr  the head of the famili  you know  is the duke of exmoor  he is one of the few realli stiff old tori aristocrat left  a sound old crust tyrant it is quit in our line to make troubl about  and i think i  m on the track of a stori that will make troubl  of cours i don  t believ in the old legend about jame i  and as for you  you don  t believ in anyth  not even in journal  the legend  you  ll probabl rememb  was about the blackest busi in english histori  the poison of overburi by that witch  s cat franc howard  and the quit mysteri terror which forc the king to pardon the murder  there was a lot of alleg witchcraft mix up with it  and the stori goe that a man  servant listen at the keyhol heard the truth in a talk between the king and carr  and the bodili ear with which he heard grew larg and monstrous as by magic  so aw was the secret  and though he had to be load with land and gold and made an ancestor of duke  the elf  shape ear is still recurr in the famili  well  you don  t believ in black magic  and if you did  you couldn  t use it for copi  if a miracl happen in your offic  you  d have to hush it up  now so mani bishop are agnost  but that is not the point the point is that there realli is someth queer about exmoor and his famili  someth quit natur  i dare say  but quit abnorm  and the ear is in it somehow  i fanci  either a symbol or a delus or diseas or someth  anoth tradit say that cavali just after jame i began to wear their hair long onli to cover the ear of the first lord exmoor  this also is no doubt fanci  the reason i point it out to you is this  it seem to me that we make a mistak in attack aristocraci entir for it champagn and diamond  most men rather admir the nob for have a good time  but i think we surrend too much when we admit that aristocraci has made even the aristocrat happi  i suggest a seri of articl point out how dreari  how inhuman  how downright diabolist  is the veri smell and atmospher of some of these great hous  there are plenti of instanc  but you couldn  t begin with a better one than the ear of the eyr  by the end of the week i think i can get you the truth about it  your ever  franci finn  mr nutt reflect a moment  stare at his left boot  then he call out in a strong  loud and entir lifeless voic  in which everi syllabl sound alik   miss barlow  take down a letter to mr finn  pleas  dear finn  i think it would do  copi should reach us second post saturday  your  e  nutt  this elabor epistl he articul as if it were all one word  and miss barlow rattl it down as if it were all one word  then he took up anoth strip of proof and a blue pencil  and alter the word  supernatur  to the word  marvel  and the express  shoot down  to the express  repress  in such happi  health activ did mr nutt disport himself  until the ensu saturday found him at the same desk  dictat to the same typist  and use the same blue pencil on the first instal of mr finn  s revel  the open was a sound piec of slash invect about the evil secret of princ  and despair in the high place of the earth  though written violent  it was in excel english  but the editor  as usual  had given to somebodi els the task of break it up into sub  head  which were of a spicier sort  as  peeress and poison  and  the eeri ear   the eyr in their eyri  and so on through a hundr happi chang  then follow the legend of the ear  amplifi from finn  s first letter  and then the substanc of his later discoveri  as follow  i know it is the practic of journalist to put the end of the stori at the begin and call it a headlin  i know that journal larg consist in say  lord jone dead  to peopl who never knew that lord jone was aliv  your present correspond think that this  like mani other journalist custom  is bad journal  and that the daili reform has to set a better exampl in such thing  he propos to tell his stori as it occur  step by step  he will use the real name of the parti  who in most case are readi to confirm his testimoni  as for the headlin  the sensat proclam  they will come at the end  i was walk along a public path that thread through a privat devonshir orchard and seem to point toward devonshir cider  when i came sudden upon just such a place as the path suggest  it was a long  low inn  consist realli of a cottag and two barn  thatch all over with the thatch that look like brown and grey hair grown befor histori  but outsid the door was a sign which call it the blue dragon  and under the sign was one of those long rustic tabl that use to stand outsid most of the free english inn  befor teetotal and brewer between them destroy freedom  and at this tabl sat three gentlemen  who might have live a hundr year ago  now that i know them all better  there is no difficulti about disentangl the impress  but just then they look like three veri solid ghost  the domin figur  both becaus he was bigger in all three dimens  and becaus he sat central in the length of the tabl  face me  was a tall  fat man dress complet in black  with a rubicund  even apoplect visag  but a rather bald and rather bother brow  look at him again  more strict  i could not exact say what it was that gave me the sens of antiqu  except the antiqu cut of his white cleric neckti and the bar wrinkl across his brow  it was even less easi to fix the impress in the case of the man at the right end of the tabl  who  to say truth  was as commonplac a person as could be seen anywher  with a round  brown  hair head and a round snub nose  but also clad in cleric black  of a stricter cut  it was onli when i saw his broad curv hat lie on the tabl besid him that i realiz whi i connect him with anyth ancient  he was a roman cathol priest  perhap the third man  at the other end of the tabl  had realli more to do with it than the rest  though he was both slighter in physic presenc and more inconsider in his dress  his lank limb were clad  i might also say clutch  in veri tight grey sleev and pantaloon  he had a long  sallow  aquilin face which seem somehow all the more saturnin becaus his lantern jaw were imprison in his collar and neck  cloth more in the style of the old stock  and his hair  which ought to have been dark brown  was of an odd dim  russet colour which  in conjunct with his yellow face  look rather purpl than red  the unobtrus yet unusu colour was all the more notabl becaus his hair was almost unnatur healthi and curl  and he wore it full  but  after all analysi  i inclin to think that what gave me my first old  fashion impress was simpli a set of tall  old  fashion wine  glass  one or two lemon and two churchwarden pipe  and also  perhap  the old  world errand on which i had come  be a harden report  and it be appar a public inn  i did not need to summon much of my impud to sit down at the long tabl and order some cider  the big man in black seem veri learn  especi about local antiqu  the small man in black  though he talk much less  surpris me with a yet wider cultur  so we got on veri well togeth  but the third man  the old gentleman in the tight pantaloon  seem rather distant and haughti  until i slid into the subject of the duke of exmoor and his ancestri  i thought the subject seem to embarrass the other two a littl  but it broke the spell of the third man  s silenc most success  speak with restraint and with the accent of a high educ gentleman  and puf at interv at his long churchwarden pipe  he proceed to tell me some of the most horribl stori i have ever heard in my life  how one of the eyr in the former age had hang his own father  and anoth had his wife scourg at the cart tail through the villag  and anoth had set fire to a church full of children  and so on  some of the tale  inde  are not fit for public print  such as the stori of the scarlet nun  the abomin stori of the spot dog  or the thing that was done in the quarri  and all this red roll of impieti came from his thin  genteel lip rather prim than otherwis  as he sat sip the wine out of his tall  thin glass  i could see that the big man opposit me was tri  if anyth  to stop him  but he evid held the old gentleman in consider respect  and could not ventur to do so at all abrupt  and the littl priest at the other end of the  tabl  though free from ani such air of embarrass  look steadili at the tabl  and seem to listen to the recit with great pain  as well as he might   you don  t seem  i said to the narrat   to be veri fond of the exmoor pedigre  he look at me a moment  his lip still prim  but whiten and tighten  then he deliber broke his long pipe and glass on the tabl and stood up  the veri pictur of a perfect gentleman with the frame temper of a fiend   these gentlemen  he said   will tell you whether i have caus to like it  the curs of the eyr of old has lain heavi on this countri  and mani have suffer from it  they know there are none who have suffer from it as i have  and with that he crush a piec of the fallen glass under his heel  and strode away among the green twilight of the twinkl appl  tree   that is an extraordinari old gentleman  i said to the other two   do you happen to know what the exmoor famili has done to him  who is he  the big man in black was stare at me with the wild air of a baffl bull  he did not at first seem to take it in  then he said at last   don  t you know who he is  i reaffirm my ignor  and there was anoth silenc  then the littl priest said  still look at the tabl   that is the duke of exmoor  then  befor i could collect my scatter sens  he ad equal quiet  but with an air of regular thing   my friend here is doctor mull  the duke  s librarian  my name is brown   but  i stammer   if that is the duke  whi doe he damn all the old duke like that   he seem realli to believ  answer the priest call brown   that they have left a curs on him  then he ad  with some irrelev   that  s whi he wear a wig  it was a few moment befor his mean dawn on me   you don  t mean that fabl about the fantast ear  i demand   i  ve heard of it  of cours  but sure it must be a superstiti yarn spun out of someth much simpler  i  ve sometim thought it was a wild version of one of those mutil stori  they use to crop crimin  ear in the sixteenth centuri   i hard think it was that  answer the littl man thought   but it is not outsid ordinari scienc or natur law for a famili to have some deform frequent reappear  such as one ear bigger than the other  the big librarian had buri his big bald brow in his big red hand  like a man tri to think out his duti   no  he groan   you do the man a wrong after all  understand  i  ve no reason to defend him  or even keep faith with him  he has been a tyrant to me as to everybodi els  don  t fanci becaus you see him sit here that he isn  t a great lord in the worst sens of the word  he would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off  if it would summon anoth man three mile to fetch a matchbox three yard off  he must have a footman to carri his walk  stick  a bodi servant to hold up his opera  glass   but not a valet to brush his cloth  cut in the priest  with a curious dryness   for the valet would want to brush his wig  too  the librarian turn to him and seem to forget my presenc  he was strong move and  i think  a littl heat with wine   i don  t know how you know it  father brown  he said   but you are right  he let the whole world do everyth for him  except dress him  and that he insist on do in a liter solitud like a desert  anybodi is kick out of the hous without a charact who is so much as found near his dress  room door   he seem a pleasant old parti  i remark   no  repli dr mull quit simpli   and yet that is just what i mean by say you are unjust to him after all  gentlemen  the duke doe realli feel the bitter about the curs that he utter just now  he doe  with sincer shame and terror  hide under that purpl wig someth he think it would blast the son of man to see  i know it is so  and i know it is not a mere natur disfigur  like a crimin mutil  or a hereditari disproport in the featur  i know it is wors than that  becaus a man told me who was present at a scene that no man could invent  where a stronger man than ani of us tri to defi the secret  and was scare away from it  i open my mouth to speak  but mull went on in oblivion of me  speak out of the cavern of his hand   i don  t mind tell you  father  becaus it  s realli more defend the poor duke than give him away  didn  t you ever hear of the time when he veri near lost all the estat  the priest shook his head  and the librarian proceed to tell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post  who had been his patron and instructor  and whom he seem to trust implicit  up to a certain point it was a common enough tale of the declin of a great famili  s fortun  the tale of a famili lawyer  his lawyer  howev  had the sens to cheat honest  if the express explain itself  instead of use fund he held in trust  he took advantag of the duke  s careless to put the famili in a financi hole  in which it might be necessari for the duke to let him hold them in realiti  the lawyer  s name was isaac green  but the duke alway call him elisha  presum in refer to the fact that he was quit bald  though certain not more than thirti  he had risen veri rapid  but from veri dirti begin  be first a  nark  or inform  and then a money  lender  but as solicitor to the eyr he had the sens  as i say  to keep technic straight until he was readi to deal the final blow  the blow fell at dinner  and the old librarian said he should never forget the veri look of the lampshad and the decant  as the littl lawyer  with a steadi smile  propos to the great landlord that they should halv the estat between them  the sequel certain could not be overlook  for the duke  in dead silenc  smash a decant on the man  s bald head as sudden as i had seen him smash the glass that day in the orchard  it left a red triangular scar on the scalp  and the lawyer  s eye alter  but not his smile  he rose totter to his feet  and struck back as such men do strike   i am glad of that  he said   for now i can take the whole estat  the law will give it to me  exmoor  it seem  was white as ash  but his eye still blaze   the law will give it you  he said   but you will not take it  whi not  whi  becaus it would mean the crack of doom for me  and if you take it i shall take off my wig  whi  you piti pluck fowl  anyon can see your bare head  but no man shall see mine and live  well  you may say what you like and make it mean what you like  but mull swear it is the solemn fact that the lawyer  after shake his knot fist in the air for an instant  simpli ran from the room and never reappear in the countrysid  and sinc then exmoor has been fear more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistr  now dr mull told his stori with rather wild theatric gestur  and with a passion i think at least partisan  i was quit conscious of the possibl that the whole was the extravag of an old braggart and gossip  but befor i end this half of my discoveri  i think it due to dr mull to record that my two first inquiri have confirm his stori  i learn from an old apothecari in the villag that there was a bald man in even dress  give the name of green  who came to him one night to have a three  corner cut on his forehead plaster  and i learnt from the legal record and old newspap that there was a lawsuit threaten  and at least begun  by one green against the duke of exmoor  mr nutt  of the daili reform  wrote some high incongru word across the top of the copi  made some high mysteri mark down the side of it  and call to miss barlow in the same loud  monoton voic   take down a letter to mr finn  dear finn  your copi will do  but i have had to headlin it a bit  and our public would never stand a romanist priest in the stori  you must keep your eye on the suburb  i  ve alter him to mr brown  a spiritualist  your  e  nutt  a day or two afterward found the activ and judici editor examin  with blue eye that seem to grow rounder and rounder  the second instal of mr finn  s tale of mysteri in high life  it began with the word  i have made an astound discoveri  i freeli confess it is quit differ from anyth i expect to discov  and will give a much more practic shock to the public  i ventur to say  without ani vaniti  that the word i now write will be read all over europ  and certain all over america and the coloni  and yet i heard all i have to tell befor i left this same littl wooden tabl in this same littl wood of appl  tree  i owe it all to the small priest brown  he is an extraordinari man  the big librarian had left the tabl  perhap asham of his long tongu  perhap anxious about the storm in which his mysteri master had vanish  anyway  he betook himself heavili in the duke  s track through the tree  father brown had pick up one of the lemon and was eye it with an odd pleasur   what a love colour a lemon is  he said   there  s one thing i don  t like about the duke  s wig  the colour   i don  t think i understand  i answer   i dare say he  s got good reason to cover his ear  like king mida  went on the priest  with a cheer simplic which somehow seem rather flippant under the circumst   i can quit understand that it  s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plate or leather flap  but if he want to use hair  whi doesn  t he make it look like hair  there never was hair of that colour in this world  it look more like a sunset  cloud come through the wood  whi doesn  t he conceal the famili curs better  if he  s realli so asham of it  shall i tell you  it  s becaus he isn  t asham of it  he  s proud of it   it  s an ugli wig to be proud of  and an ugli stori  i said   consid  repli this curious littl man   how you yourself realli feel about such thing  i don  t suggest you  re either more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us  but don  t you feel in a vagu way that a genuin old famili curs is rather a fine thing to have  would you be asham  wouldn  t you be a littl proud  if the heir of the glami horror call you his friend  or if byron  s famili had confid  to you onli  the evil adventur of their race  don  t be too hard on the aristocrat themselv if their head are as weak as our would be  and they are snob about their own sorrow   by jove  i cri   and that  s true enough  my own mother  s famili had a banshe  and  now i come to think of it  it has comfort me in mani a cold hour   and think  he went on   of that stream of blood and poison that spurt from his thin lip the instant you so much as mention his ancestor  whi should he show everi stranger over such a chamber of horror unless he is proud of it  he doesn  t conceal his wig  he doesn  t conceal his blood  he doesn  t conceal his famili curs  he doesn  t conceal the famili crime  but  the littl man  s voic chang so sudden  he shut his hand so sharpli  and his eye so rapid grew rounder and brighter like a wake owl  s  that it had all the abrupt of a small explos on the tabl   but  he end   he doe realli conceal his toilet  it somehow complet the thrill of my fanci nerv that at that instant the duke appear again silent among the glimmer tree  with his soft foot and sunset  hu hair  come round the corner of the hous in compani with his librarian  befor he came within earshot  father brown had ad quit compos   whi doe he realli hide the secret of what he doe with the purpl wig  becaus it isn  t the sort of secret we suppos  the duke came round the corner and resum his seat at the head of the tabl with all his nativ digniti  the embarrass of the librarian left him hover on his hind leg  like a huge bear  the duke address the priest with great serious   father brown  he said   doctor mull inform me that you have come here to make a request  i no longer profess an observ of the religion of my father  but for their sake  and for the sake of the day when we met befor  i am veri will to hear you  but i presum you would rather be heard in privat  whatev i retain of the gentleman made me stand up  whatev i have attain of the journalist made me stand still  befor this paralysi could pass  the priest had made a momentarili detain motion   if  he said   your grace will permit me my real petit  or if i retain ani right to advis you  i would urg that as mani peopl as possibl should be present  all over this countri i have found hundr  even of my own faith and flock  whose imagin are poison by the spell which i implor you to break  i wish we could have all devonshir here to see you do it   to see me do what  ask the duke  arch his eyebrow   to see you take off your wig  said father brown  the duke  s face did not move  but he look at his petition with a glassi stare which was the most aw express i have ever seen on a human face  i could see the librarian  s great leg waver under him like the shadow of stem in a pool  and i could not banish from my own brain the fanci that the tree all around us were fill soft in the silenc with devil instead of bird   i spare you  said the duke in a voic of inhuman piti   i refus  if i gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror i have to bear alon  you would lie shriek at these feet of mine and beg to know no more  i will spare you the hint  you shall not spell the first letter of what is written on the altar of the unknown god   i know the unknown god  said the littl priest  with an unconsci grandeur of certitud that stood up like a granit tower   i know his name  it is satan  the true god was made flesh and dwelt among us  and i say to you  wherev you find men rule mere by mysteri  it is the mysteri of iniqu  if the devil tell you someth is too fear to look at  look at it  if he say someth is too terribl to hear  hear it  if you think some truth unbear  bear it  i entreat your grace to end this nightmar now and here at this tabl   if i did  said the duke in a low voic   you and all you believ  and all by which alon you live  would be the first to shrivel and perish  you would have an instant to know the great noth befor you die   the cross of christ be between me and harm  said father brown   take off your wig  i was lean over the tabl in ungovern excit  in listen to this extraordinari duel half a thought had come into my head   your grace  i cri   i call your bluff  take off that wig or i will knock it off  i suppos i can be prosecut for assault  but i am veri glad i did it  when he said  in the same voic of stone   i refus  i simpli sprang on him  for three long instant he strain against me as if he had all hell to help him  but i forc his head until the hairi cap fell off it  i admit that  whilst wrestl  i shut my eye as it fell  i was awaken by a cri from mull  who was also by this time at the duke  s side  his head and mine were both bend over the bald head of the wigless duke  then the silenc was snap by the librarian exclaim   what can it mean  whi  the man had noth to hide  his ear are just like everybodi els  s   yes  said father brown   that is what he had to hide  the priest walk straight up to him  but strang enough did not even glanc at his ear  he stare with an almost comic serious at his bald forehead  and point to a three  corner cicatric  long heal  but still discern   mr green  i think  he said polit   and he did get the whole estat after all  and now let me tell the reader of the daili reform what i think the most remark thing in the whole affair  this transform scene  which will seem to you as wild and purpl as a persian fairi  tale  has been  except for my technic assault  strict legal and constitut from it first begin  this man with the odd scar and the ordinari ear is not an impostor  though  in one sens  he wear anoth man  s wig and claim anoth man  s ear  he has not stolen anoth man  s coronet  he realli is the one and onli duke of exmoor  what happen was this  the old duke realli had a slight malform of the ear  which realli was more or less hereditari  he realli was morbid about it  and it is like enough that he did invok it as a kind of curs in the violent scene  which undoubt happen  in which he struck green with the decant  but the contest end veri differ  green press his claim and got the estat  the dispossess nobleman shot himself and die without issu  after a decent interv the beauti english govern reviv the

cheer  he crumpl up the copi and toss it into the wast  paper basket  but not befor he had  automat and by forc of habit  alter the word  god  to the word  circumst  viii  the perish of the pendragon father brown was in no mood for adventur  he had late fallen ill with over  work  and when he began to recov  his friend flambeau had taken him on a cruis in a small yacht with sir cecil fanshaw  a young cornish squir and an enthusiast for cornish coast sceneri  but brown was still rather weak  he was no veri happi sailor  and though he was never of the sort that either grumbl or break down  his spirit did not rise abov patienc and civil  when the other two men prais the rag violet sunset or the rag volcan crag  he agre with them  when flambeau point out a rock shape like a dragon  he look at it and thought it veri like a dragon  when fanshaw more excit indic a rock that was like merlin  he look at it  and signifi assent  when flambeau ask whether this rocki gate of the twist river was not the gate of fairyland  he said  yes  he heard the most import thing and the most trivial with the same tasteless absorpt  he heard that the coast was death to all but care seamen  he also heard that the ship  s cat was asleep  he heard that fanshaw couldn  t find his cigar  holder anywher  he also heard the pilot deliv the oracl  both eye bright  she  s all right  one eye wink  down she sink  he heard flambeau say to fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eye open and be spri  and he heard fanshaw say to flambeau that  odd enough  it didn  t mean this  it meant that while they saw two of the coast light  one near and the other distant  exact side by side  they were in the right river  channel  but that if one light was hidden behind the other  they were go on the rock  he heard fanshaw add that his countri was full of such quaint fabl and idiom  it was the veri home of romanc  he even pit this part of cornwal against devonshir  as a claimant to the laurel of elizabethan seamanship  accord to him there had been captain among these cove and islet compar with whom drake was practic a landsman  he heard flambeau laugh  and ask if  perhap  the adventur titl of  westward ho  onli meant that all devonshir men wish they were live in cornwal  he heard fanshaw say there was no need to be silli  that not onli had cornish captain been hero  but that they were hero still  that near that veri spot there was an old admir  now retir  who was scar by thrill voyag full of adventur  and who had in his youth found the last group of eight pacif island that was ad to the chart of the world  this cecil fanshaw was  in person  of the kind that common urg such crude but pleas enthusiasm  a veri young man  light  hair  high  colour  with an eager profil  with a boyish bravado of spirit  but an almost girlish delicaci of tint and type  the big shoulder  black brow and black mousquetair swagger of flambeau were a great contrast  all these trivial brown heard and saw  but heard them as a tire man hear a tune in the railway wheel  or saw them as a sick man see the pattern of his wall  paper  no one can calcul the turn of mood in convalesc  but father brown  s depress must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliar with the sea  for as the river mouth narrow like the neck of a bottl  and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earth  he seem to wake up and take notic like a babi  they had reach that phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright  but earth and all it grow thing look almost black by comparison  about this particular even  howev  there was someth except  it was one of those rare atmospher in which a smoke  glass slide seem to have been slid away from between us and natur  so that even dark colour on that day look more gorgeous than bright colour on cloudier day  the trampl earth of the river  bank and the peati stain in the pool did not look drab but glow umber  and the dark wood astir in the breez did not look  as usual  dim blue with mere depth of distanc  but more like wind  tumbl mass of some vivid violet blossom  this magic clear and intens in the colour was further forc on brown  s slowli reviv sens by someth romant and even secret in the veri form of the landscap  the river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasur boat so small as their  but the curv of the countri  side suggest that it was close in on either hand  the wood seem to be make broken and fli attempt at bridg  build  as if the boat were pass from the romanc of a valley to the romanc of a hollow and so to the suprem romanc of a tunnel  beyond this mere look of thing there was littl for brown  s freshen fanci to feed on  he saw no human be  except some gipsi trail along the river bank  with faggot and osier cut in the forest  and one sight no longer unconvent  but in such remot part still uncommon  a dark  hair ladi  bare  head  and paddl her own cano  if father brown ever attach ani import to either of these  he certain forgot them at the next turn of the river which brought in sight a singular object  the water seem to widen and split  be cloven by the dark wedg of a fish  shape and wood islet  with the rate at which they went  the islet seem to swim toward them like a ship  a ship with a veri high prow  or  to speak more strict  a veri high funnel  for at the extrem point nearest them stood up an odd  look build  unlik anyth they could rememb or connect with ani purpos  it was not special high  but it was too high for it breadth to be call anyth but a tower  yet it appear to be built entir of wood  and that in a most unequ and eccentr way  some of the plank and beam were of good  season oak  some of such wood cut raw and recent  some again of white pinewood  and a great deal more of the same sort of wood paint black with tar  these black beam were set crook or crisscross at all kind of angl  give the whole a most patchi and puzzl appear  there were one or two window  which appear to be colour and lead in an old  fashion but more elabor style  the travel look at it with that paradox feel we have when someth remind us of someth  and yet we are certain it is someth veri differ  father brown  even when he was mystifi  was clever in analys his own mystif  and he found himself reflect that the odditi seem to consist in a particular shape cut out in an incongru materi  as if one saw a top  hat made of tin  or a frock  coat cut out of tartan  he was sure he had seen timber of differ tint arrang like that somewher  but never in such architectur proport  the next moment a glimps through the dark tree told him all he want to know and he laugh  through a gap in the foliag there appear for a moment one of those old wooden hous  face with black beam  which are still to be found here and there in england  but which most of us see imit in some show call  old london  or  shakespear  s england  it was in view onli long enough for the priest to see that  howev old  fashion  it was a comfort and well  kept countri  hous  with flower  bed in front of it  it had none of the piebald and crazi look of the tower that seem made out of it refus   what on earth  s this  said flambeau  who was still stare at the tower  fanshaw  s eye were shine  and he spoke triumphant   aha  you  ve not seen a place quit like this befor  i fanci  that  s whi i  ve brought you here  my friend  now you shall see whether i exagger about the marin of cornwal  this place belong to old pendragon  whom we call the admir  though he retir befor get the rank  the spirit of raleigh and hawkin is a memori with the devon folk  it  s a modern fact with the pendragon  if queen elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up this river in a gild barg  she would be receiv by the admir in a hous exact such as she was accustom to  in everi corner and casement  in everi panel on the wall or plate on the tabl  and she would find an english captain still talk fierc of fresh land to be found in littl ship  as much as if she had dine with drake   she  d find a rum sort of thing in the garden  said father brown   which would not pleas her renaiss eye  that elizabethan domest architectur is charm in it way  but it  s against the veri natur of it to break out into turret   and yet  answer fanshaw   that  s the most romant and elizabethan part of the busi  it was built by the pendragon in the veri day of the spanish war  and though it  s need patch and even rebuild for anoth reason  it  s alway been rebuilt in the old way  the stori goe that the ladi of sir peter pendragon built it in this place and to this height  becaus from the top you can just see the corner where vessel turn into the river mouth  and she wish to be the first to see her husband  s ship  as he sail home from the spanish main   for what other reason  ask father brown   do you mean that it has been rebuilt   oh  there  s a strang stori about that  too  said the young squir with relish   you are realli in a land of strang stori  king arthur was here and merlin and the fairi befor him  the stori goe that sir peter pendragon  who  i fear  had some of the fault of the pirat as well as the virtu of the sailor  was bring home three spanish gentlemen in honour captiv  intend to escort them to elizabeth  s court  but he was a man of flame and tigerish temper  and come to high word with one of them  he caught him by the throat and flung him by accid or design  into the sea  a second spaniard  who was the brother of the first  instant drew his sword and flew at pendragon  and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wound in as mani minut  pendragon drove his blade through the other  s bodi and the second spaniard was account for  as it happen the ship had alreadi turn into the river mouth and was close to compar shallow water  the third spaniard sprang over the side of the ship  struck out for the shore  and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist in water  and turn again to face the ship  and hold up both arm to heaven  like a prophet call plagu upon a wick citi  he call out to pendragon in a pierc and terribl voic  that he at least was yet live  that he would go on live  that he would live for ever  and that generat after generat the hous of pendragon should never see him or his  but should know by veri certain sign that he and his vengeanc were aliv  with that he dive under the wave  and was either drown or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterward   there  s that girl in the cano again  said flambeau irrelev  for good  look young women would call him off ani topic   she seem bother by the queer tower just as we were  inde  the black  hair young ladi was let her cano float slowli and silent past the strang islet  and was look intent up at the strang tower  with a strong glow of curios on her oval and oliv face   never mind girl  said fanshaw impati   there are plenti of them in the world  but not mani thing like the pendragon tower  as you may easili suppos  plenti of superstit and scandal have follow in the track of the spaniard  s curs  and no doubt  as you would put it  ani accid happen to this cornish famili would be connect with it by rural credul  but it is perfect true that this tower has been burnt down two or three time  and the famili can  t be call lucki  for more than two  i think  of the admir  s near kin have perish by shipwreck  and one at least  to my own knowledg  on practic the same spot where sir peter threw the spaniard overboard   what a piti  exclaim flambeau   she  s go   when did your friend the admir tell you this famili histori  ask father brown  as the girl in the cano paddl off  without show the least intent of extend her interest from the tower to the yacht  which fanshaw had alreadi caus to lie alongsid the island   mani year ago  repli fanshaw   he hasn  t been to sea for some time now  though he is as keen on it as ever  i believ there  s a famili compact or someth  well  here  s the land stage  let  s come ashor and see the old boy  they follow him on to the island  just under the tower  and father brown  whether from the mere touch of dri land  or the interest of someth on the other bank of the river  which he stare at veri hard for some second  seem singular improv in brisk  they enter a wood avenu between two fenc of thin greyish wood  such as often enclos park or garden  and over the top of which the dark tree toss to and fro like black and purpl plume upon the hears of a giant  the tower  as they left it behind  look all the quainter  becaus such entranc are usual flank by two tower  and this one look lopsid  but for this  the avenu had the usual appear of the entranc to a gentleman  s ground  and  be so curv that the hous was now out of sight  somehow look a much larger park than ani plantat on such an island could realli be  father brown was  perhap  a littl fanci in his fatigu  but he almost thought the whole place must be grow larger  as thing do in a nightmar  anyhow  a mystic monotoni was the onli charact of their march  until fanshaw sudden stop  and point to someth stick out through the grey fenc  someth that look at first rather like the imprison horn of some beast  closer observ show that it was a slight curv blade of metal that shone faint in the fade light  flambeau  who like all frenchmen had been a soldier  bent over it and said in a startl voic   whi  it  s a sabr  i believ i know the sort  heavi and curv  but shorter than the cavalri  they use to have them in artilleri and the  as he spoke the blade pluck itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with a more ponder slash  split the fissipar fenc to the bottom with a rend nois  then it was pull out again  flash abov the fenc some feet further along  and again split it halfway down with the first stroke  and after waggl a littl to extric itself  accompani with curs in the dark  split it down to the ground with a second  then a kick of devilish energi sent the whole loosen squar of thin wood fli into the pathway  and a great gap of dark coppic gape in the pale  fanshaw peer into the dark open and utter an exclam of astonish   my dear admir  he exclaim   do you  er  do you general cut out a new front door whenev you want to go for a walk  the voic in the gloom swore again  and then broke into a jolli laugh   no  it said   i  ve realli got to cut down this fenc somehow  it  s spoil all the plant  and no one els here can do it  but i  ll onli carv anoth bit off the front door  and then come out and welcom you  and sure enough  he heav up his weapon onc more  and  hack twice  brought down anoth and similar strip of fenc  make the open about fourteen feet wide in all  then through this larger forest gateway he came out into the even light  with a chip of grey wood stick to his sword  blade  he momentarili fulfil all fanshaw  s fabl of an old pirat admir  though the detail seem afterward to decompos into accid  for instanc  he wore a broad  brim hat as protect against the sun  but the front flap of it was turn up straight to the sky  and the two corner pull down lower than the ear  so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cock hat worn by nelson  he wore an ordinari dark  blue jacket  with noth special about the button  but the combin of it with white linen trouser somehow had a sailorish look  he was tall and loos  and walk with a sort of swagger  which was not a sailor  s roll  and yet somehow suggest it  and he held in his hand a short sabr which was like a navi cutlass  but about twice as big  under the bridg of the hat his eagl face look eager  all the more becaus it was not onli clean  shaven  but without eyebrow  it seem almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrust it through a throng of element  his eye were promin and pierc  his colour was curious attract  while part tropic  it remind one vagu of a blood  orang  that is  that while it was ruddi and sanguin  there was a yellow in it that was in no way sick  but seem rather to glow like gold appl of the hesperid  father brown thought he had never seen a figur so express of all the romanc about the countri of the sun  when fanshaw had present his two friend to their host he fell again into a tone of ralli the latter about his wreckag of the fenc and his appar rage of profan  the admir pooh  pooh it at first as a piec of necessari but annoy garden work  but at length the ring of real energi came back into his laughter  and he cri with a mixtur of impati and good humour   well  perhap i do go at it a bit rabid  and feel a kind of pleasur in smash anyth  so would you if your onli pleasur was in cruis about to find some new cannib island  and you had to stick on this muddi littl rockeri in a sort of rustic pond  when i rememb how i  ve cut down a mile and a half of green poison jungl with an old cutlass half as sharp as this  and then rememb i must stop here and chop this matchwood  becaus of some confound old bargain scribbl in a famili bibl  whi  i  he swung up the heavi steel again  and this time sunder the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke   i feel like that  he said laugh  but furious fling the sword some yard down the path   and now let  s go up to the hous  you must have some dinner  the semicircl of lawn in front of the hous was vari by three circular garden bed  one of red tulip  a second of yellow tulip  and the third of some white  waxen  look blossom that the visitor did not know and presum to be exot  a heavi  hairi and rather sullen  look garden was hang up a heavi coil of garden hose  the corner of the expir sunset which seem to cling about the corner of the hous gave glimps here and there of the colour of remot flowerb  and in a treeless space on one side of the hous open upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilt a big brass telescop  just outsid the step of the porch stood a littl paint green garden tabl  as if someon had just had tea there  the entranc was flank with two of those half  featur lump of stone with hole for eye that are said to be south sea idol  and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confus carv that look almost as barbar  as they pass indoor  the littl cleric hop sudden on to the tabl  and stand on it peer unaffect through his spectacl at the mould in the oak  admir pendragon look veri much astonish  though not particular annoy  while fanshaw was so amus with what look like a perform pigmi on his littl stand  that he could not control his laughter  but father brown was not like to notic either the laughter or the astonish  he was gaze at three carv symbol  which  though veri worn and obscur  seem still to convey some sens to him  the first seem to be the outlin of some tower or other build  crown with what look like cur  point ribbon  the second was clearer  an old elizabethan galley with decor wave beneath it  but interrupt in the middl by a curious jag rock  which was either a fault in the wood or some convent represent of the water come in  the third repres the upper half of a human figur  end in an escallop line like the wave  the face was rub and featureless  and both arm were held veri stiffli up in the air   well  mutter father brown  blink   here is the legend of the spaniard plain enough  here he is hold up his arm and curs in the sea  and here are the two curs  the wreck ship and the burn of pendragon tower  pendragon shook his head with a kind of vener amus   and how mani other thing might it not be  he said   don  t you know that that sort of half  man  like a half  lion or half  stag  is quit common in heraldri  might not that line through the ship be one of those parti  per  pale line  indent  i think they call it  and though the third thing isn  t so veri herald  it would be more herald to suppos it a tower crown with laurel than with fire  and it look just as like it   but it seem rather odd  said flambeau   that it should exact confirm the old legend   ah  repli the sceptic travel   but you don  t know how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figur  besid  it isn  t the onli old legend  fanshaw  here  who is fond of such thing  will tell you there are other version of the tale  and much more horribl one  one stori credit my unfortun ancestor with have had the spaniard cut in two  and that will fit the pretti pictur also  anoth oblig credit our famili with the possess of a tower full of snake and explain those littl  wrigg thing in that way  and a third theori suppos the crook line on the ship to be a convention thunderbolt  but that alon  if serious examin  would show what a veri littl way these unhappi coincid realli go   whi  how do you mean  ask fanshaw   it so happen  repli his host coolli   that there was no thunder and lightn at all in the two or three shipwreck i know of in our famili   oh  said father brown  and jump down from the littl tabl  there was anoth silenc in which they heard the continu murmur of the river  then fanshaw said  in a doubt and perhap disappoint tone   then you don  t think there is anyth in the tale of the tower in flame   there are the tale  of cours  said the admir  shrug his shoulder   and some of them  i don  t deni  on evid as decent as one ever get for such thing  someon saw a blaze hereabout  don  t you know  as he walk home through a wood  someon keep sheep on the upland inland thought he saw a flame hover over pendragon tower  well  a damp dab of mud like this confound island seem the last place where one would think of fire   what is that fire over there  ask father brown with a gentl sudden  point to the wood on the left river  bank  they were all thrown a littl off their balanc  and the more fanci fanshaw had even some difficulti in recov his  as they saw a long  thin stream of blue smoke ascend silent into the end of the even light  then pendragon broke into a scorn laugh again   gipsi  he said   they  ve been camp about here for about a week  gentlemen  you want your dinner  and he turn as if to enter the hous  but the antiquarian superstit in fanshaw was still quiver  and he said hastili   but  admir  what  s that hiss nois quit near the island  it  s veri like fire   it  s more like what it is  said the admir  laugh as he led the way   it  s onli some cano go by  almost as he spoke  the butler  a lean man in black  with veri black hair and a veri long  yellow face  appear in the doorway and told him that dinner was serv  the dine  room was as nautic as the cabin of a ship  but it note was rather that of the modern than the elizabethan captain  there were  inde  three antiqu cutlass in a trophi over the fireplac  and one brown sixteenth  centuri map with triton and littl ship dot about a cur sea  but such thing were less promin on the white panel than some case of quaint  colour south american bird  veri scientif stuf  fantast shell from the pacif  and sever instrument so rude and queer in shape that savag might have use them either to kill their enemi or to cook them  but the alien colour culmin in the fact that  besid the butler  the admir  s onli servant were two negro  somewhat quaint clad in tight uniform of yellow  the priest  s instinct trick of analys his own impress told him that the colour and the littl neat coat  tail of these bipe had suggest the word  canari  and so by a mere pun connect them with southward travel  toward the end of the dinner they took their yellow cloth and black face out of the room  leav onli the black cloth and yellow face of the butler   i  m rather sorri you take this so light  said fanshaw to the host   for the truth is  i  ve brought these friend of mine with the idea of their help you  as they know a good deal of these thing  don  t you realli believ in the famili stori at all   i don  t believ in anyth  answer pendragon veri brisk  with a bright eye cock at a red tropic bird   i  m a man of scienc  rather to flambeau  s surpris  his cleric friend  who seem to have entir woken up  took up the digress and talk natur histori with his host with a flow of word and much unexpect inform  until the dessert and decant were set down and the last of the servant vanish  then he said  without alter his tone   pleas don  t think me impertin  admir pendragon  i don  t ask for curios  but realli for my guidanc and your conveni  have i made a bad shot if i guess you don  t want these old thing talk of befor your butler  the admir lift the hairless arch over his eye and exclaim   well  i don  t know where you got it  but the truth is i can  t stand the fellow  though i  ve no excus for discharg a famili servant  fanshaw  with his fairi tale  would say my blood move against men with that black  spanish  look hair  flambeau struck the tabl with his heavi fist   by jove  he cri   and so had that girl   i hope it  ll all end tonight  continu the admir   when my nephew come back safe from his ship  you look surpris  you won  t understand  i suppos  unless i tell you the stori  you see  my father had two son  i remain a bachelor  but my elder brother marri  and had a son who becam a sailor like all the rest of us  and will inherit the proper estat  well  my father was a strang man  he somehow combin fanshaw  s superstit with a good deal of my sceptic  they were alway fight in him  and after my first voyag  he develop a notion which he thought somehow would settl final whether the curs was truth or trash  if all the pendragon sail about anyhow  he thought there would be too much chanc of natur catastroph to prove anyth  but if we went to sea one at a time in strict order of success to the properti  he thought it might show whether ani connect fate follow the famili as a famili  it was a silli notion  i think  and i quarrel with my father pretti heartili  for i was an ambiti man and was left to the last  come  by success  after my own nephew   and your father and brother  said the priest  veri gentl   die at sea  i fear   yes  groan the admir   by one of those brutal accid on which are built all the lie mytholog of mankind  they were both shipwreck  my father  come up this coast out of the atlant  was wash up on these cornish rock  my brother  s ship was sunk  no one know where  on the voyag home from tasmania  his bodi was never found  i tell you it was from perfect natur mishap  lot of other peopl besid pendragon were drown  and both disast are discuss in a normal way by navig  but  of cours  it set this forest of superstit on fire  and men saw the flame tower everywher  that  s whi i say it will be all right when walter return  the girl he  s engag to was come today  but i was so afraid of some chanc delay frighten her that i wire her not to come till she heard from me  but he  s practic sure to be here some time tonight  and then it  ll all end in smoke  tobacco smoke  we  ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottl of this wine   veri good wine  said father brown  grave lift his glass   but  as you see  a veri bad wine  bibber  i most sincer beg your pardon  for he had spilt a small spot of wine on the tabl  cloth  he drank and put down the glass with a compos face  but his hand had start at the exact moment when he becam conscious of a face look in through the garden window just behind the admir  the face of a woman  swarthi  with southern hair and eye  and young  but like a mask of tragedi  after a paus the priest spoke again in his mild manner   admir  he said   will you do me a favour  let me  and my friend if they like  stop in that tower of your just for tonight  do you know that in my busi you  re an exorcist almost befor anyth els  pendragon sprang to his feet and pace swift to and fro across the window  from which the face had instant vanish   i tell you there is noth in it  he cri  with ring violenc   there is one thing i know about this matter  you may call me an atheist  i am an atheist  here he swung round and fix father brown with a face of fright concentr   this busi is perfect natur  there is no curs in it at all  father brown smile   in that case  he said   there can  t be ani object to my sleep in your delight summer  hous   the idea is utter ridicul  repli the admir  beat a tattoo on the back of his chair   pleas forgiv me for everyth  said brown in his most sympathet tone   includ spill the wine  but it seem to me you are not quit so easi about the flame tower as you tri to be  admir pendragon sat down again as abrupt as he had risen  but he sat quit still  and when he spoke again it was in a lower voic   you do it at your own peril  he said   but wouldn  t you be an atheist to keep sane in all this devilri  some three hour afterward fanshaw  flambeau and the priest were still dawdl about the garden in the dark  and it began to dawn on the other two that father brown had no intent of go to bed either in the tower or the hous   i think the lawn want weed  said he dreamili   if i could find a spud or someth i  d do it myself  they follow him  laugh and half remonstr  but he repli with the utmost solemn  explain to them  in a madden littl sermon  that one can alway find some small occup that is help to other  he did not find a spud  but he found an old broom made of twig  with which he began energet to brush the fallen leav off the grass   alway some littl thing to be done  he said with idiot cheer   as georg herbert say   who sweep an admir  s garden in cornwal as for thi law make that and the action fine

out  samson  cri flambeau   whi  you  ve cut off the tulip  s head  father brown stood ruefulli contempl the decapit plant   mine doe seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of water  he admit  scratch his head   i suppos it  s a piti i didn  t find the spud  you should have seen me with the spud  talk of tool  you  ve got that swordstick  flambeau  you alway carri  that  s right  and sir cecil could have that sword the admir threw away by the fenc here  how grey everyth look   the mist  s rise from the river  said the stare flambeau  almost as he spoke the huge figur of the hairi garden appear on a higher ridg of the trench and terrac lawn  hail them with a brandish rake and a horribl bellow voic   put down that hose  he shout   put down that hose and go to your   i am fear clumsi  repli the reverend gentleman weak   do you know  i upset some wine at dinner  he made a waver half  turn of apolog toward the garden  with the hose still spout in his hand  the garden caught the cold crash of the water full in his face like the crash of a cannon  ball  stagger  slip and went sprawl with his boot in the air   how veri dread  said father brown  look round in a sort of wonder   whi  i  ve hit a man  he stood with his head forward for a moment as if look or listen  and then set off at a trot toward the tower  still trail the hose behind him  the tower was quit close  but it outlin was curious dim   your river mist  he said   has a rum smell   by the lord it has  cri fanshaw  who was veri white   but you can  t mean   i mean  said father brown   that one of the admir  s scientif predict is come true tonight  this stori is go to end in smoke  as he spoke a most beauti rose  red light seem to burst into blossom like a gigant rose  but accompani with a crackl and rattl nois that was like the laughter of devil   my god  what is this  cri sir cecil fanshaw   the sign of the flame tower  said father brown  and sent the drive water from his hose into the heart of the red patch   lucki we hadn  t gone to bed  ejacul fanshaw   i suppos it can  t spread to the hous   you may rememb  said the priest quiet   that the wooden fenc that might have carri it was cut away  flambeau turn electrifi eye upon his friend  but fanshaw onli said rather absent   well  nobodi can be kill  anyhow   this is rather a curious kind of tower  observ father brown   when it take to kill peopl  it alway kill peopl who are somewher els  at the same instant the monstrous figur of the garden with the stream beard stood again on the green ridg against the sky  wave other to come on  but now wave not a rake but a cutlass  behind him came the two negro  also with the old crook cutlass out of the trophi  but in the blood  red glare  with their black face and yellow figur  they look like devil carri instrument of tortur  in the dim garden behind them a distant voic was heard call out brief direct  when the priest heard the voic  a terribl chang came over his counten  but he remain compos  and never took his eye off the patch of flame which had begun by spread  but now seem to shrink a littl as it hiss under the torch of the long silver spear of water  he kept his finger along the nozzl of the pipe to ensur the aim  and attend to no other busi  know onli by the nois and that semi  conscious corner of the eye  the excit incid that began to tumbl themselv about the island garden  he gave two brief direct to his friend  one was   knock these fellow down somehow and tie them up  whoever they are  there  s rope down by those faggot  they want to take away my nice hose  the other was   as soon as you get a chanc  call out to that cano girl  she  s over on the bank with the gipsi  ask her if they could get some bucket across and fill them from the river  then he close his mouth and continu to water the new red flower as ruthless as he had water the red tulip  he never turn his head to look at the strang fight that follow between the foe and friend of the mysteri fire  he almost felt the island shake when flambeau collid with the huge garden  he mere imagin how it would whirl round them as they wrestl  he heard the crash fall  and his friend  s gasp of triumph as he dash on to the first negro  and the cri of both the black as flambeau and fanshaw bound them  flambeau  s enorm strength more than redress the odd in the fight  especi as the fourth man still hover near the hous  onli a shadow and a voic  he heard also the water broken by the paddl of a cano  the girl  s voic give order  the voic of gipsi answer and come nearer  the plump and suck nois of empti bucket plung into a full stream  and final the sound of mani feet around the fire  but all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent  which had late onc more increas  had onc more slight diminish  then came a cri that veri near made him turn his head  flambeau and fanshaw  now reinforc by some of the gipsi  had rush after the mysteri man by the hous  and he heard from the other end of the garden the frenchman  s cri of horror and astonish  it was echo by a howl not to be call human  as the be broke from their hold and ran along the garden  three time at least it race round the whole island  in a way that was as horribl as the chase of a lunat  both in the cri of the pursu and the rope carri by the pursuer  but was more horribl still  becaus it somehow suggest one of the chase game of children in a garden  then  find them close in on everi side  the figur sprang upon one of the higher river bank and disappear with a splash into the dark and drive river   you can do no more  i fear  said brown in a voic cold with pain   he has been wash down to the rock by now  where he has sent so mani other  he knew the use of a famili legend   oh  don  t talk in these parabl  cri flambeau impati   can  t you put it simpli in word of one syllabl   yes  answer brown  with his eye on the hose   both eye bright  she  s all right  one eye blink  down she sink  the fire hiss and shriek more and more  like a strangl thing  as it grew narrow and narrow under the flood from the pipe and bucket  but father brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speak   i thought of ask this young ladi  if it were morn yet  to look through that telescop at the river mouth and the river  she might have seen someth to interest her  the sign of the ship  or mr walter pendragon come home  and perhap even the sign of the half  man  for though he is certain safe by now  he may veri well have wade ashor  he has been within a shave of anoth shipwreck  and would never have escap it  if the ladi hadn  t had the sens to suspect the old admir  s telegram and come down to watch him  don  t let  s talk about the old admir  don  t let  s talk about anyth  it  s enough to say that whenev this tower  with it pitch and resin  wood  realli caught fire  the spark on the horizon alway look like the twin light to the coast light  hous   and that  said flambeau   is how the father and brother die  the wick uncl of the legend veri near got his estat after all  father brown did not answer  inde  he did not speak again  save for civil  till they were all safe round a cigar  box in the cabin of the yacht  he saw that the frustrat fire was extinguish  and then refus to linger  though he actual heard young pendragon  escort by an enthusiast crowd  come tramp up the river bank  and might  had he been move by romant curios  have receiv the combin thank of the man from the ship and the girl from the cano  but his fatigu had fallen on him onc more  and he onli start onc  when flambeau abrupt told him he had drop cigar  ash on his trouser   that  s no cigar  ash  he said rather wearili   that  s from the fire  but you don  t think so becaus you  re all smoke cigar  that  s just the way i got my first faint suspicion about the chart   do you mean pendragon  s chart of his pacif island  ask fanshaw   you thought it was a chart of the pacif island  answer brown   put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyon will think it  s a specimen  put the same feather with a ribbon and an artifici flower and everyon will think it  s for a ladi  s hat  put the same feather with an ink  bottl  a book and a stack of write  paper  and most men will swear they  ve seen a quill pen  so you saw that map among tropic bird and shell and thought it was a map of pacif island  it was the map of this river   but how do you know  ask fanshaw   i saw the rock you thought was like a dragon  and the one like merlin  and   you seem to have notic a lot as we came in  cri fanshaw   we thought you were rather abstract   i was sea  sick  said father brown simpli   i felt simpli horribl  but feel horribl has noth to do with not see thing  and he close his eye   do you think most men would have seen that  ask flambeau  he receiv no answer  father brown was asleep  ix  the god of the gong it was one of those chilli and empti afternoon in earli winter  when the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver  if it was dreari in a hundr bleak offic and yawn draw  room  it was drearier still along the edg of the flat essex coast  where the monotoni was the more inhuman for be broken at veri long interv by a lamp  post that look less civil than a tree  or a tree that look more ugli than a lamp  post  a light fall of snow had half  melt into a few strip  also look leaden rather than silver  when it had been fix again by the seal of frost  no fresh snow had fallen  but a ribbon of the old snow ran along the veri margin of the coast  so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam  the line of the sea look frozen in the veri vivid of it violet  blue  like the vein of a frozen finger  for mile and mile  forward and back  there was no breath soul  save two pedestrian  walk at a brisk pace  though one had much longer leg and took much longer stride than the other  it did not seem a veri appropri place or time for a holiday  but father brown had few holiday  and had to take them when he could  and he alway prefer  if possibl  to take them in compani with his old friend flambeau  ex  crimin and ex  detect  the priest had had a fanci for visit his old parish at cobhol  and was go north  eastward along the coast  after walk a mile or two farther  they found that the shore was begin to be formal embank  so as to form someth like a parad  the ugli lamp  post becam less few and far between and more ornament  though quit equal ugli  half a mile farther on father brown was puzzl first by littl labyrinth of flowerless flower  pot  cover with the low  flat  quiet  colour plant that look less like a garden than a tessel pavement  between weak cur path stud with seat with cur back  he faint snif the atmospher of a certain sort of seasid town that be did not special care about  and  look ahead along the parad by the sea  he saw someth that put the matter beyond a doubt  in the grey distanc the big bandstand of a water  place stood up like a giant mushroom with six leg   i suppos  said father brown  turn up his coat  collar and draw a woollen scarf rather closer round his neck   that we are approach a pleasur resort   i fear  answer flambeau   a pleasur resort to which few peopl just now have the pleasur of resort  they tri to reviv these place in the winter  but it never succeed except with brighton and the old one  this must be seawood  i think  lord pooley  s experi  he had the sicilian singer down at christma  and there  s talk about hold one of the great glove  fight here  but they  ll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea  it  s as dreari as a lost railway  carriag  they had come under the big bandstand  and the priest was look up at it with a curios that had someth rather odd about it  his head a littl on one side  like a bird  s  it was the convent  rather tawdri kind of erect for it purpos  a flatten dome or canopi  gilt here and there  and lift on six slender pillar of paint wood  the whole be rais about five feet abov the parad on a round wooden platform like a drum  but there was someth fantast about the snow combin with someth artifici about the gold that haunt flambeau as well as his friend with some associ he could not captur  but which he knew was at onc artist and alien   i  ve got it  he said at last   it  s japanes  it  s like those fanci japanes print  where the snow on the mountain look like sugar  and the gilt on the pagoda is like gilt on gingerbread  it look just like a littl pagan templ   yes  said father brown   let  s have a look at the god  and with an agil hard to be expect of him  he hop up on to the rais platform   oh  veri well  said flambeau  laugh  and the next instant his own tower figur was visibl on that quaint elev  slight as was the differ of height  it gave in those level wast a sens of see yet farther and farther across land and sea  inland the littl wintri garden fade into a confus grey cops  beyond that  in the distanc  were long low barn of a lone farmhous  and beyond that noth but the long east anglian plain  seaward there was no sail or sign of life save a few seagul  and even they look like the last snowflak  and seem to float rather than fli  flambeau turn abrupt at an exclam behind him  it seem to come from lower down than might have been expect  and to be address to his heel rather than his head  he instant held out his hand  but he could hard help laugh at what he saw  for some reason or other the platform had given way under father brown  and the unfortun littl man had drop through to the level of the parad  he was just tall enough  or short enough  for his head alon to stick out of the hole in the broken wood  look like st john the baptist  s head on a charger  the face wore a disconcert express  as did  perhap  that of st john the baptist  in a moment he began to laugh a littl   this wood must be rotten  said flambeau   though it seem odd it should bear me  and you go through the weak place  let me help you out  but the littl priest was look rather curious at the corner and edg of the wood alleg to be rotten  and there was a sort of troubl on his brow   come along  cri flambeau impati  still with his big brown hand extend   don  t you want to get out  the priest was hold a splinter of the broken wood between his finger and thumb  and did not immedi repli  at last he said thought   want to get out  whi  no  i rather think i want to get in  and he dive into the dark under the wooden floor so abrupt as to knock off his big curv cleric hat and leav it lie on the board abov  without ani cleric head in it  flambeau look onc more inland and out to sea  and onc more could see noth but sea as wintri as the snow  and snow as level as the sea  there came a scurri nois behind him  and the littl priest came scrambl out of the hole faster than he had fallen in  his face was no longer disconcert  but rather resolut  and  perhap onli through the reflect of the snow  a trifl paler than usual   well  ask his tall friend   have you found the god of the templ   no  answer father brown   i have found what was sometim more import  the sacrific   what the devil do you mean  cri flambeau  quit alarm  father brown did not answer  he was stare  with a knot in his forehead  at the landscap  and he sudden point at it   what  s that hous over there  he ask  follow his finger  flambeau saw for the first time the corner of a build nearer than the farmhous  but screen for the most part with a fring of tree  it was not a larg build  and stood well back from the shore  but a glint of ornament on it suggest that it was part of the same water  place scheme of decor as the bandstand  the littl garden and the cur  back iron seat  father brown jump off the bandstand  his friend follow  and as they walk in the direct indic the tree fell away to right and left  and they saw a small  rather flashi hotel  such as is common in resort  the hotel of the saloon bar rather than the bar parlour  almost the whole frontag was of gilt plaster and figur glass  and between that grey seascap and the grey  witch  like tree  it gimcrack qualiti had someth spectral in it melancholi  they both felt vagu that if ani food or drink were offer at such a hostelri  it would be the past  board ham and empti mug of the pantomim  in this  howev  they were not altogeth confirm  as they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet  which was appar close  one of the iron garden  seat with cur back that had adorn the garden  but much longer  run almost the whole length of the frontag  presum  it was place so that visitor might sit there and look at the sea  but one hard expect to find anyon do it in such weather  nevertheless  just in front of the extrem end of the iron seat stood a small round restaur tabl  and on this stood a small bottl of chabli and a plate of almond and raisin  behind the tabl and on the seat sat a dark  hair young man  barehead  and gaze at the sea in a state of almost astonish immobl  but though he might have been a waxwork when they were within four yard of him  he jump up like a jack  in  the  box when they came within three  and said in a deferenti  though not undignifi  manner   will you step insid  gentlemen  i have no staff at present  but i can get you anyth simpl myself   much oblig  said flambeau   so you are the proprietor   yes  said the dark man  drop back a littl into his motionless manner   my waiter are all italian  you see  and i thought it onli fair they should see their countryman beat the black  if he realli can do it  you know the great fight between malvoli and nigger ned is come off after all   i  m afraid we can  t wait to troubl your hospit serious  said father brown   but my friend would be glad of a glass of sherri  i  m sure  to keep out the cold and drink success to the latin champion  flambeau did not understand the sherri  but he did not object to it in the least  he could onli say amiabl   oh  thank you veri much   sherri  sir  certain  said their host  turn to his hostel   excus me if i detain you a few minut  as i told you  i have no staff  and he went toward the black window of his shutter and unlight inn   oh  it doesn  t realli matter  began flambeau  but the man turn to reassur him   i have the key  he said   i could find my way in the dark   i didn  t mean  began father brown  he was interrupt by a bellow human voic that came out of the bowel of the uninhabit hotel  it thunder some foreign name loud but inaud  and the hotel proprietor move more sharpli toward it than he had done for flambeau  s sherri  as instant evid prove  the proprietor had told  then and after  noth but the liter truth  but both flambeau and father brown have often confess that  in all their  often outrag  adventur  noth had so chill their blood as that voic of an ogr  sound sudden out of a silent and empti inn   my cook  cri the proprietor hastili   i had forgotten my cook  he will be start present  sherri  sir  and  sure enough  there appear in the doorway a big white bulk with white cap and white apron  as befit a cook  but with the needless emphasi of a black face  flambeau had often heard that negro made good cook  but somehow someth in the contrast of colour and cast increas his surpris that the hotel proprietor should answer the call of the cook  and not the cook the call of the proprietor  but he reflect that head cook are proverbi arrog  and  besid  the host had come back with the sherri  and that was the great thing   i rather wonder  said father brown   that there are so few peopl about the beach  when this big fight is come on after all  we onli met one man for mile  the hotel proprietor shrug his shoulder   they come from the other end of the town  you see  from the station  three mile from here  they are onli interest in the sport  and will stop in hotel for the night onli  after all  it is hard weather for bask on the shore   or on the seat  said flambeau  and point to the littl tabl   i have to keep a look  out  said the man with the motionless face  he was a quiet  well  featur fellow  rather sallow  his dark cloth had noth distinct about them  except that his black neckti was worn rather high  like a stock  and secur by a gold pin with some grotesqu head to it  nor was there anyth notabl in the face  except someth that was probabl a mere nervous trick  a habit of open one eye more narrowli than the other  give the impress that the other was larger  or was  perhap  artifici  the silenc that ensu was broken by their host say quiet   whereabout did you meet the one man on your march   curious enough  answer the priest   close by here  just by that bandstand  flambeau  who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherri  put it down and rose to his feet  stare at his friend in amaz  he open his mouth to speak  and then shut it again   curious  said the dark  hair man thought   what was he like   it was rather dark when i saw him  began father brown   but he was  as has been said  the hotel  keeper can be prove to have told the precis truth  his phrase that the cook was start present was fulfil to the letter  for the cook came out  pull his glove on  even as they spoke  but he was a veri differ figur from the confus mass of white and black that had appear for an instant in the doorway  he was button and buckl up to his burst eyebal in the most brilliant fashion  a tall black hat was tilt on his broad black head  a hat of the sort that the french wit has compar to eight mirror  but somehow the black man was like the black hat  he also was black  and yet his glossi skin flung back the light at eight angl or more  it is needless to say that he wore white spat and a white slip insid his waistcoat  the red flower stood up in his buttonhol aggress  as if it had sudden grown there  and in the way he carri his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitud  an attitud we must alway rememb when we talk of racial prejudic  someth innoc and insol  the cake walk   sometim  said flambeau  look after him   i  m not surpris that they lynch them   i am never surpris  said father brown   at ani work of hell  but as i was say  he resum  as the negro  still ostentati pull on his yellow glove  betook himself brisk toward the water  place  a queer music  hall figur against that grey and frosti scene  as i was say  i couldn  t describ the man veri minut  but he had a flourish and old  fashion whisker and moustachio  dark or dy  as in the pictur of foreign financi  round his neck was wrap a long purpl scarf that thrash out in the wind as he walk  it was fix at the throat rather in the way that nurs fix children  s comfort with a safeti  pin  onli this  ad the priest  gaze placid out to sea   was not a safeti  pin  the man sit on the long iron bench was also gaze placid out to sea  now he was onc more in repos  flambeau felt quit certain that one of his eye was natur larger than the other  both were now well open  and he could almost fanci the left eye grew larger as he gaze   it was a veri long gold pin  and had the carv head of a monkey or some such thing  continu the cleric   and it was fix in a rather odd way  he wore pinc  nez and a broad black  the motionless man continu to gaze at the sea  and the eye in his head might have belong to two differ men  then he made a movement of blind swift  father brown had his back to him  and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face  flambeau had no weapon  but his larg brown hand were rest on the end of the long iron seat  his shoulder abrupt alter their shape  and he heav the whole huge thing high over his head  like a headsman  s axe about to fall  the mere height of the thing  as he held it vertic  look like a long iron ladder by which he was invit men to climb toward the star  but the long shadow  in the level even light  look like a giant brandish the eiffel tower  it was the shock of that shadow  befor the shock of the iron crash  that made the stranger quail and dodg  and then dart into his inn  leav the flat and shine dagger he had drop exact where it had fallen   we must get away from here instant  cri flambeau  fling the huge seat away with furious indiffer on the beach  he caught the littl priest by the elbow and ran him down a grey perspect of barren back garden  at the end of which there was a close back garden door  flambeau bent over it an instant in violent silenc  and then said   the door is lock  as he spoke a black feather from one of the ornament fir fell  brush the brim of his hat  it startl him more than the small and distant deton that had come just befor  then came anoth distant deton  and the door he was tri to open shook under the bullet buri in it  flambeau  s shoulder again fill out and alter sudden  three hing and a lock burst at the same instant  and he went out into the empti path behind  carri the great garden door with him  as samson carri the gate of gaza  then he flung the garden door over the garden wall  just as a third shot pick up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel  without ceremoni he snatch up the littl priest  slung him astraddl on his shoulder  and went race toward seawood as fast as his long leg could carri him  it was not until near two mile farther on that he set his small companion down  it had hard been a dignifi escap  in spite of the classic model of anchis  but father brown  s face onli wore a broad grin   well  said flambeau  after an impati silenc  as they resum their more convent tramp through the street on the edg of the town  where no outrag need be fear   i don  t know what all this mean  but i take it i may trust my own eye that you never met the man you have so accur describ   i did meet him in a way  brown said  bite his finger rather nervous  i did realli  and it was too dark to see him proper  becaus it was under that bandstand affair  but i  m afraid i didn  t describ him so veri accur after all  for his pinc  nez was broken under him  and the long gold pin wasn  t stuck through his purpl scarf but through his heart   and i suppos  said the other in a lower voic   that glass  eye guy had someth to do with it   i had hope he had onli a littl  answer brown in a rather troubl voic   and i may have been wrong in what i did  i act on impuls  but i fear this busi has deep root and dark  they walk on through some street in silenc  the yellow lamp were begin to be lit in the cold blue twilight  and they were evid approach the more central part of the town  high colour bill announc the glove  fight between nigger ned and malvoli were slap about the wall   well  said flambeau   i never murder anyon  even in my crimin day  but i can almost sympath with anyon do it in such a dreari place  of all god  forsaken dustbin of natur  i think the most heart  break are place like that bandstand  that were meant to be festiv and are forlorn  i can fanci a morbid man feel he must kill his rival in the solitud and ironi of such a scene  i rememb onc take a tramp in your glorious surrey hill  think of noth but gors and skylark  when i came out on a vast circl of land  and over me lift a vast  voiceless structur  tier abov tier of seat  as huge as a roman amphitheatr and as empti as a new letter  rack  a bird sail in heaven over it  it was the grand stand at epsom  and i felt that no one would ever be happi there again   it  s odd you should mention epsom  said the priest   do you rememb what was call the sutton mysteri  becaus two suspect men  ice  cream men  i think  happen to live at sutton  they were eventu releas  a man was found strangl  it was said  on the down round that part  as a fact  i know  from an irish policeman who is a friend of mine  that he was found close up to the epsom grand stand  in fact  onli hidden by one of the lower door be push back   that is queer  assent flambeau   but it rather confirm my view that such pleasur place look aw lone out of season  or the man wouldn  t have been murder there   i  m not so sure he  began brown  and stop   not so sure he was murder  queri his companion   not so sure he was murder out of the season  answer the littl priest  with simplic   don  t you think there  s someth rather tricki about this solitud  flambeau  do you feel sure a wise murder would alway want the spot to be lone  it  s veri  veri seldom a man is quit alon  and  short of that  the more alon he is  the more certain he is to be seen  no  i think there must be some other  whi  here we are at the pavilion or palac  or whatev they call it  they had emerg on a small squar  brilliant light  of which the princip build was gay with gild  gaudi with poster  and flank with two giant photograph of malvoli and nigger ned   hallo  cri flambeau in great surpris  as his cleric friend stump straight up the broad step   i didn  t know pugil was your latest hobbi  are you go to see the fight   i don  t think there will be ani fight  repli father brown  they pass rapid through ant  room and inner room  they pass through the hall of combat itself  rais  rope  and pad with innumer seat and box  and still the cleric did not look round or paus till he came to a clerk at a desk outsid a door mark  committe  there he stop and ask to see lord pooley  the attend observ that his lordship was veri busi  as the fight was come on soon  but father brown had a good  temper tedium of reiter for which the offici mind is general not prepar  in a few moment the rather baffl flambeau found himself in the presenc of a man who was still shout direct to anoth man go out of the room   be care  you know  about the rope after the fourth  well  and what do you want  i wonder  lord pooley was a gentleman  and  like most of the few remain to our race  was worri  especi about money  he was half grey and half flaxen  and he had the eye of fever and a high  bridg  frost  bitten nose   onli a word  said father brown   i have come to prevent a man be kill  lord pooley bound off his chair as if a spring had flung him from it   i  m damn if i  ll stand ani more of this  he cri   you and your committe and parson and petit  weren  t there parson in the old day  when they fought without glove  now they  re fight with the regul glove  and there  s not the rag of a possibl of either of the boxer be kill   i didn  t mean either of the boxer  said the littl priest   well  well  well  said the nobleman  with a touch of frosti humour   who  s go to be kill  the refere   i don  t know who  s go to be kill  repli father brown  with a reflect stare   if i did i shouldn  t have to spoil your pleasur  i could simpli get him to escap  i never could see anyth wrong about prize  fight  as it is  i must ask you to announc that the fight is off for the present   anyth els  jeer the gentleman with feverish eye   and what do you say to the two thousand peopl who have come to see it   i say there will be one thousand nine  hundr and nineti  nine of them left aliv when they have seen it  said father brown  lord pooley look at flambeau   is your friend mad  he ask   far from it  was the repli   and took here  resum pooley in

ani tramp under the hedg or motorist among the hill  but nobodi would have seen it when the stand was crowd and the whole ring roar  when the favourit was come in first  or wasn  t  the twist of a neck  cloth  the thrust of a bodi behind a door could be done in an instant  so long as it was that instant  it was the same  of cours  he continu turn to flambeau   with that poor fellow under the bandstand  he was drop through the hole  it wasn  t an accident hole  just at some veri dramat moment of the entertain  when the bow of some great violinist or the voic of some great singer open or came to it climax  and here  of cours  when the knock  out blow came  it would not be the onli one  that is the littl trick nigger ned has adopt from his old god of gong   by the way  malvoli  pooley began   malvoli  said the priest   has noth to do with it  i dare say he has some italian with him  but our amiabl friend are not italian  they are octoroon and african half  blood of various shade  but i fear we english think all foreign are much the same so long as they are dark and dirti  also  he ad  with a smile   i fear the english declin to draw ani fine distinct between the moral charact produc by my religion and that which bloom out of voodoo  the blaze of the spring season had burst upon seawood  litter it foreshor with famin and bath  machin  with nomad preacher and nigger minstrel  befor the two friend saw it again  and long befor the storm of pursuit after the strang secret societi had die away  almost on everi hand the secret of their purpos perish with them  the man of the hotel was found drift dead on the sea like so much seawe  his right eye was close in peac  but his left eye was wide open  and glisten like glass in the moon  nigger ned had been overtaken a mile or two away  and murder three policemen with his close left hand  the remain offic was surpris  nay  pain  and the negro got away  but this was enough to set all the english paper in a flame  and for a month or two the main purpos of the british empir was to prevent the buck nigger  who was so in both sens  escap by ani english port  person of a figur remot reconcil with his were subject to quit extraordinari inquisit  made to scrub their face befor go on board ship  as if each white complexion were made up like a mask  of greasepaint  everi negro in england was put under special regul and made to report himself  the outgo ship would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk  for peopl had found out how fear and vast and silent was the forc of the savag secret societi  and by the time flambeau and father brown were lean on the parad parapet in april  the black man meant in england almost what he onc meant in scotland   he must be still in england  observ flambeau   and horrid well hidden  too  they must have found him at the port if he had onli whiten his face   you see  he is realli a clever man  said father brown apologet   and i  m sure he wouldn  t whiten his face   well  but what would he do   i think  said father brown   he would blacken his face  flambeau  lean motionless on the parapet  laugh and said   my dear fellow  father brown  also lean motionless on the parapet  move one finger for an instant into the direct of the soot  mask nigger sing on the sand  x  the salad of colonel cray father brown was walk home from mass on a white weird morn when the mist were slowli lift  one of those morn when the veri element of light appear as someth mysteri and new  the scatter tree outlin themselv more and more out of the vapour  as if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal  at yet more distant interv appear the hous upon the broken fring of the suburb  their outlin becam clearer and clearer until he recogn mani in which he had chanc acquaint  and mani more the name of whose owner he knew  but all the window and door were seal  none of the peopl were of the sort that would be up at such a time  or still less on such an errand  but as he pass under the shadow of one handsom villa with veranda and wide ornat garden  he heard a nois that made him almost involuntarili stop  it was the unmistak nois of a pistol or carbin or some light firearm discharg  but it was not this that puzzl him most  the first full nois was immedi follow by a seri of fainter nois  as he count them  about six  he suppos it must be the echo  but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the origin sound  it was not like anyth els that he could think of  the three thing nearest to it seem to be the nois made by siphon of soda  water  one of the mani nois made by an anim  and the nois made by a person attempt to conceal laughter  none of which seem to make much sens  father brown was made of two men  there was a man of action  who was as modest as a primros and as punctual as a clock  who went his small round of duti and never dream of alter it  there was also a man of reflect  who was much simpler but much stronger  who could not easili be stop  whose thought was alway  in the onli intellig sens of the word  free thought  he could not help  even unconsci  ask himself all the question that there were to be ask  and answer as mani of them as he could  all that went on like his breath or circul  but he never conscious carri his action outsid the sphere of his own duti  and in this case the two attitud were apt test  he was just about to resum his trudg in the twilight  tell himself it was no affair of his  but instinct twist and untwist twenti theori about what the odd nois might mean  then the grey sky  line brighten into silver  and in the broaden light he realiz that he had been to the hous which belong to an anglo  indian major name putnam  and that the major had a nativ cook from malta who was of his communion  he also began to rememb that pistol  shot are sometim serious thing  accompani with consequ with which he was legitim concern  he turn back and went in at the garden gate  make for the front door  half  way down one side of the hous stood out a project like a veri low shed  it was  as he afterward discov  a larg dustbin  round the corner of this came a figur  at first a mere shadow in the haze  appar bend and peer about  then  come nearer  it solidifi into a figur that was  inde  rather unusu solid  major putnam was a bald  head  bull  neck man  short and veri broad  with one of those rather apoplect face that are produc by a prolong attempt to combin the orient climat with the occident luxuri  but the face was a good  humour one  and even now  though evid puzzl and inquisit  wore a kind of innoc grin  he had a larg palm  leaf hat on the back of his head  suggest a halo that was by no mean appropri to the face  but otherwis he was clad onli in a veri vivid suit of stripe scarlet and yellow pyjama  which  though glow enough to behold  must have been  on a fresh morn  pretti chilli to wear  he had evid come out of his hous in a hurri  and the priest was not surpris when he call out without further ceremoni   did you hear that nois   yes  answer father brown   i thought i had better look in  in case anyth was the matter  the major look at him rather queer with his good  humour gooseberri eye   what do you think the nois was  he ask   it sound like a gun or someth  repli the other  with some hesit   but it seem to have a singular sort of echo  the major was still look at him quiet  but with protrud eye  when the front door was flung open  releas a flood of gaslight on the face of the fade mist  and anoth figur in pyjama sprang or tumbl out into the garden  the figur was much longer  leaner  and more athlet  the pyjama  though equal tropic  were compar tast  be of white with a light lemon  yellow stripe  the man was haggard  but handsom  more sunburn than the other  he had an aquilin profil and rather deep  sunken eye  and a slight air of odditi aris from the combin of coal  black hair with a much lighter moustach  all this father brown absorb in detail more at leisur  for the moment he onli saw one thing about the man  which was the revolv in his hand   cray  exclaim the major  stare at him   did you fire that shot   yes  i did  retort the black  hair gentleman hot   and so would you in my place  if you were chase everywher by devil and near  the major seem to interven rather hurri   this is my friend father brown  he said  and then to brown   i don  t know whether you  ve met colonel cray of the royal artilleri   i have heard of him  of cours  said the priest innoc   did you  did you hit anyth   i thought so  answer cray with graviti   did he  ask major putnam in a lower voic   did he fall or cri out  or anyth  colonel cray was regard his host with a strang and steadi stare   i  ll tell you exact what he did  he said   he sneez  father brown  s hand went half  way to his head  with the gestur of a man rememb somebodi  s name  he knew now what it was that was neither soda  water nor the snort of a dog   well  ejacul the stare major   i never heard befor that a servic revolv was a thing to be sneez at   nor i  said father brown faint   it  s lucki you didn  t turn your artilleri on him or you might have given him quit a bad cold  then  after a bewild paus  he said   was it a burglar   let us go insid  said major putnam  rather sharpli  and led the way into his hous  the interior exhibit a paradox often to be mark in such morn hour  that the room seem brighter than the sky outsid  even after the major had turn out the one gaslight in the front hall  father brown was surpris to see the whole dine  tabl set out as for a festiv meal  with napkin in their ring  and wine  glass of some six unnecessari shape set besid everi plate  it was common enough  at that time of the morn  to find the remain of a banquet over  night  but to find it fresh spread so earli was unusu  while he stood waver in the hall major putnam rush past him and sent a rage eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth  at last he spoke  splutter   all the silver gone  he gasp   fish  knive and fork gone  old cruet  stand gone  even the old silver cream  jug gone  and now  father brown  i am readi to answer your question of whether it was a burglar   they  re simpli a blind  said cray stubborn   i know better than you whi peopl persecut this hous  i know better than you whi  the major pat him on the shoulder with a gestur almost peculiar to the sooth of a sick child  and said   it was a burglar  obvious it was a burglar   a burglar with a bad cold  observ father brown   that might assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood  the major shook his head in a sombr manner   he must be far beyond trace now  i fear  he said  then  as the restless man with the revolv turn again toward the door in the garden  he ad in a huski  confidenti voic   i doubt whether i should send for the polic  for fear my friend here has been a littl too free with his bullet  and got on the wrong side of the law  he  s live in veri wild place  and  to be frank with you  i think he sometim fanci thing   i think you onc told me  said brown   that he believ some indian secret societi is pursu him  major putnam nod  but at the same time shrug his shoulder   i suppos we  d better follow him outsid  he said   i don  t want ani more  shall we say  sneez  they pass out into the morn light  which was now even ting with sunshin  and saw colonel cray  s tall figur bent almost doubl  minut examin the condit of gravel and grass  while the major stroll unobtrus toward him  the priest took an equal indol turn  which took him round the next corner of the hous to within a yard or two of the project dustbin  he stood regard this dismal object for some minut and a half  then he step toward it  lift the lid and put his head insid  dust and other discolour matter shook upward as he did so  but father brown never observ his own appear  whatev els he observ  he remain thus for a measur period  as if engag in some mysteri prayer  then he came out again  with some ash on his hair  and walk unconcern away  by the time he came round to the garden door again he found a group there which seem to roll away morbid as the sunlight had alreadi roll away the mist  it was in no way ration reassur  it was simpli broad comic  like a cluster of dicken  s charact  major putnam had manag to slip insid and plung into a proper shirt and trouser  with a crimson cummerbund  and a light squar jacket over all  thus normal set off  his red festiv face seem burst with a commonplac cordial  he was inde emphat  but then he was talk to his cook  the swarthi son of malta  whose lean  yellow and rather careworn face contrast quaint with his snow  white cap and costum  the cook might well be careworn  for cookeri was the major  s hobbi  he was one of those amateur who alway know more than the profession  the onli other person he even admit to be a judg of an omelett was his friend cray  and as brown rememb this  he turn to look for the other offic  in the new presenc of daylight and peopl cloth and in their right mind  the sight of him was rather a shock  the taller and more eleg man was still in his night  garb  with tousl black hair  and now crawl about the garden on his hand and knee  still look for trace of the burglar  and now and again  to all appear  strike the ground with his hand in anger at not find him  see him thus quadruped in the grass  the priest rais his eyebrow rather sad  and for the first time guess that  fanci thing  might be an euphem  the third item in the group of the cook and the epicur was also known to father brown  it was audrey watson  the major  s ward and housekeep  and at this moment  to judg by her apron  tuck  up sleev and resolut manner  much more the housekeep than the ward   it serv you right  she was say   i alway told you not to have that old  fashion cruet  stand   i prefer it  said putnam  placabl   i  m old  fashion myself  and the thing keep togeth   and vanish togeth  as you see  she retort   well  if you are not go to bother about the burglar  i shouldn  t bother about the lunch  it  s sunday  and we can  t send for vinegar and all that in the town  and you indian gentlemen can  t enjoy what you call a dinner without a lot of hot thing  i wish to good now you hadn  t ask cousin oliv to take me to the music servic  it isn  t over till half  past twelv  and the colonel has to leav by then  i don  t believ you men can manag alon   oh yes  we can  my dear  said the major  look at her veri amiabl   marco has all the sauc  and we  ve often done ourselv well in veri rough place  as you might know by now  and it  s time you had a treat  audrey  you mustn  t be a housekeep everi hour of the day  and i know you want to hear the music   i want to go to church  she said  with rather sever eye  she was one of those handsom women who will alway be handsom  becaus the beauti is not in an air or a tint  but in the veri structur of the head and featur  but though she was not yet middl  age and her auburn hair was of a titianesqu full in form and colour  there was a look in her mouth and around her eye which suggest that some sorrow wast her  as wind wast at last the edg of a greek templ  for inde the littl domest difficulti of which she was now speak so decis was rather comic than tragic  father brown gather  from the cours of the convers  that cray  the other gourmet  had to leav befor the usual lunch  time  but that putnam  his host  not to be done out of a final feast with an old croni  had arrang for a special dejeun to be set out and consum in the cours of the morn  while audrey and other graver person were at morn servic  she was go there under the escort of a relat and old friend of her  dr oliv oman  who  though a scientif man of a somewhat bitter type  was enthusiast for music  and would go even to church to get it  there was noth in all this that could conceiv concern the tragedi in miss watson  s face  and by a half conscious instinct  father brown turn again to the seem lunat grub about in the grass  when he stroll across to him  the black  unbrush head was lift abrupt  as if in some surpris at his continu presenc  and inde  father brown  for reason best known to himself  had linger much longer than polit requir  or even  in the ordinari sens  permit   well  cri cray  with wild eye   i suppos you think i  m mad  like the rest   i have consid the thesi  answer the littl man  compos   and i inclin to think you are not   what do you mean  snap cray quit savag   real madmen  explain father brown   alway encourag their own morbid  they never strive against it  but you are tri to find trace of the burglar  even when there aren  t ani  you are struggl against it  you want what no madman ever want   and what is that   you want to be prove wrong  said brown  dure the last word cray had sprung or stagger to his feet and was regard the cleric with agit eye   by hell  but that is a true word  he cri   they are all at me here that the fellow was onli after the silver  as if i shouldn  t be onli too pleas to think so  she  s been at me  and he toss his tousl black head toward audrey  but the other had no need of the direct   she  s been at me today about how cruel i was to shoot a poor harmless hous  breaker  and how i have the devil in me against poor harmless nativ  but i was a good  natur man onc  as good  natur as putnam  after a paus he said   look here  i  ve never seen you befor  but you shall judg of the whole stori  old putnam and i were friend in the same mess  but  owe to some accid on the afghan border  i got my command much sooner than most men  onli we were both invalid home for a bit  i was engag to audrey out there  and we all travel back togeth  but on the journey back thing happen  curious thing  the result of them was that putnam want it broken off  and even audrey keep it hang on  and i know what they mean  i know what they think i am  so do you   well  these are the fact  the last day we were in an indian citi i ask putnam if i could get some trichinopoli cigar  he direct me to a littl place opposit his lodg  i have sinc found he was quit right  but  opposit  is a danger word when one decent hous stand opposit five or six squalid one  and i must have mistaken the door  it open with difficulti  and then onli on dark  but as i turn back  the door behind me sank back and settl into it place with a nois as of innumer bolt  there was noth to do but to walk forward  which i did through passag after passag  pitch  dark  then i came to a flight of step  and then to a blind door  secur by a latch of elabor eastern ironwork  which i could onli trace by touch  but which i loosen at last  i came out again upon gloom  which was half turn into a greenish twilight by a multitud of small but steadi lamp below  they show mere the feet or fring of some huge and empti architectur  just in front of me was someth that look like a mountain  i confess i near fell on the great stone platform on which i had emerg  to realiz that it was an idol  and worst of all  an idol with it back to me   it was hard half human  i guess  to judg by the small squat head  and still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turn up behind and point  like a loathsom larg finger  at some symbol graven in the centr of the vast stone back  i had begun  in the dim light  to guess at the hieroglyph  not without horror  when a more horribl thing happen  a door open silent in the templ wall behind me and a man came out  with a brown face and a black coat  he had a carv smile on his face  of copper flesh and ivori teeth  but i think the most hate thing about him was that he was in european dress  i was prepar  i think  for shroud priest or nake fakir  but this seem to say that the devilri was over all the earth  as inde i found it to be   if you had onli seen the monkey  s feet  he said  smile steadili  and without other prefac   we should have been veri gentl  you would onli be tortur and die  if you had seen the monkey  s face  still we should be veri moder  veri toler  you would onli be tortur and live  but as you have seen the monkey  s tail  we must pronounc the worst sentenc  which is  go free   when he said the word i heard the elabor iron latch with which i had struggl  automat unlock itself  and then  far down the dark passag i had pass  i heard the heavi street  door shift it own bolt backward   it is vain to ask for merci  you must go free  said the smile man   henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword  and a breath shall bite you like an adder  weapon shall come against you out of nowher  and you shall die mani time  and with that he was swallow onc more in the wall behind  and i went out into the street  cray paus  and father brown unaffect sat down on the lawn and began to pick daisi  then the soldier continu   putnam  of cours  with his jolli common sens  pooh  pooh all my fear  and from that time date his doubt of my mental balanc  well  i  ll simpli tell you  in the fewest word  the three thing that have happen sinc  and you shall judg which of us is right   the first happen in an indian villag on the edg of the jungl  but hundr of mile from the templ  or town  or type of tribe and custom where the curs had been put on me  i woke in black midnight  and lay think of noth in particular  when i felt a faint tickl thing  like a thread or a hair  trail across my throat  i shrank back out of it way  and could not help think of the word in the templ  but when i got up and sought light and a mirror  the line across my neck was a line of blood   the second happen in a lodg in port said  later  on our journey home togeth  it was a jumbl of tavern and curios  shop  and though there was noth there remot suggest the cult of the monkey  it is  of cours  possibl that some of it imag or talisman were in such a place  it curs was there  anyhow  i woke again in the dark with a sensat that could not be put in colder or more liter word than that a breath bit like an adder  exist was an agoni of extinct  i dash my head against wall until i dash it against a window  and fell rather than jump into the garden below  putnam  poor fellow  who had call the other thing a chanc scratch  was bound to take serious the fact of find me half insens on the grass at dawn  but i fear it was my mental state he took serious  and not my stori   the third happen in malta  we were in a fortress there  and as it happen our bedroom overlook the open sea  which almost came up to our window  sill  save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea  i woke up again  but it was not dark  there was a full moon  as i walk to the window  i could have seen a bird on the bare battlement  or a sail on the horizon  what i did see was a sort of stick or branch circl  self  support  in the empti sky  it flew straight in at my window and smash the lamp besid the pillow i had just quit  it was one of those queer  shape war  club some eastern tribe use  but it had come from no human hand  father brown threw away a daisi  chain he was make  and rose with a wist look   has major putnam  he ask   got ani eastern curio  idol  weapon and so on  from which one might get a hint   plenti of those  though not much use  i fear  repli cray   but by all mean come into his studi  as they enter they pass miss watson button her glove for church  and heard the voic of putnam downstair still give a lectur on cookeri to the cook  in the major  s studi and den of curio they came sudden on a third parti  silk  hat and dress for the street  who was pore over an open book on the smoke  tabl  a book which he drop rather guiltili  and turn  cray introduc him civilli enough  as dr oman  but he show such disfavour in his veri face that brown guess the two men  whether audrey knew it or not  were rival  nor was the priest wholli unsympathet with the prejudic  dr oman was a veri well  dress gentleman inde  well  featur  though almost dark enough for an asiat  but father brown had to tell himself sharpli that one should be in chariti even with those who wax their point beard  who have small glove hand  and who speak with perfect modul voic  cray seem to find someth special irrit in the small prayer  book in oman  s dark  glove hand   i didn  t know that was in your line  he said rather rude  oman laugh mild  but without offenc   this is more so  i know  he said  lay his hand on the big book he had drop   a dictionari of drug and such thing  but it  s rather too larg to take to church  then he close the larger book  and there seem again the faintest touch of hurri and embarrass   i suppos  said the priest  who seem anxious to chang the subject   all these spear and thing are from india   from everywher  answer the doctor   putnam is an old soldier  and has been in mexico and australia  and the cannib island for all i know   i hope it was not in the cannib island  said brown   that he learnt the art of cookeri  and he ran his eye over the stew  pot or other strang utensil on the wall  at this moment the jolli subject of their convers thrust his laugh  lobsterish face into the room   come along  cray  he cri   your lunch is just come in  and the bell are ring for those who want to go to church  cray slip upstair to chang  dr oman and miss watson betook themselv solemn down the street  with a string of other churchgoer  but father brown notic that the doctor twice look back and scrutin the hous  and even came back to the corner of the street to look at it again  the priest look puzzl   he can  t have been at the dustbin  he mutter   not in those cloth  or was he there earlier today  father brown  touch other peopl  was as sensit as a baromet  but today he seem about as sensit as a rhinocero  by no social law  rigid or impli  could he be suppos to linger round the lunch of the anglo  indian friend  but he linger  cover his posit with torrent of amus but quit needless convers  he was the more puzzl becaus he did not seem to want ani lunch  as one after anoth of the most exquisit balanc kedgere of curri  accompani with their appropri vintag  were laid befor the other two  he

his purpl face mottl   a crime  he cri hoars   i will go for the polic  the priest could hear him drag down his palm  leaf hat from the peg and tumbl out of the front door  he heard the garden gate slam  but he onli stood look at cray  and after a silenc said quiet   i shall not talk to you much  but i will tell you what you want to know  there is no curs on you  the templ of the monkey was either a coincid or a part of the trick  the trick was the trick of a white man  there is onli one weapon that will bring blood with that mere featheri touch  a razor held by a white man  there is one way of make a common room full of invis  overpow poison  turn on the gas  the crime of a white man  and there is onli one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window  turn in mid  air and come back to the window next to it  the australian boomerang  you  ll see some of them in the major  s studi  with that he went outsid and spoke for a moment to the doctor  the moment after  audrey watson

toward the garden gate   i suppos the major was in love with her  too  he said with a sigh  and when the other nod  observ   you were veri generous  doctor  you did a fine thing  but what made you

is a long time look for the polic   or the polic in look for the major  said the priest   well  good  bye  xi  the strang crime of john boulnoi mr calhoun kidd was a veri young gentleman with a veri old face  a face dri up with it own eager  frame in blue  black hair and a black butterfli tie  he was the emissari in england of the coloss american daili call the western sun  also humor describ as the  rise sunset  this was in allus to a great journalist declar  attribut to mr kidd himself  that  he guess the sun would rise in the west yet  if american citizen did a bit more hustl  those  howev  who mock american journal from the standpoint of somewhat mellow tradit forget a certain paradox which part redeem it  for while the journal of the state permit a pantomim vulgar long past anyth english  it also show a real excit about the most earnest mental problem  of which english paper are innoc  or rather incap  the sun was full of the most solemn matter treat in the most farcic way  william jame figur there as well as  weari willi  and pragmatist altern with pugilist in the long process of it portrait  thus  when a veri unobtrus oxford man name john boulnoi wrote in a veri unread review call the natur philosophi quarter a seri of articl on alleg weak point in darwinian evolut  it flutter no corner of the english paper  though boulnoi  s theori  which was that of a compar stationari univers visit occasion by convuls of chang  had some rather faddi fashion at oxford  and got so far as to be name  catastroph  but mani american paper seiz on the challeng as a great event  and the sun threw the shadow of mr boulnoi quit gigant across it page  by the paradox alreadi note  articl of valuabl intellig and enthusiasm were present with headlin appar written by an illiter maniac  headlin such as  darwin chew dirt  critic boulnoi say he jump the shock  or  keep catastroph  say thinker boulnoi  and mr calhoun kidd  of the western sun  was bidden to take his butterfli tie and lugubri visag down to the littl hous outsid oxford where thinker boulnoi live in happi ignor of such a titl  that fate philosoph had consent  in a somewhat daze manner  to receiv the interview  and had name the hour of nine that even  the last of a summer sunset clung about cumnor and the low wood hill  the romant yanke was both doubt of his road and inquisit about his surround  and see the door of a genuin feudal old  countri inn  the champion arm  stand open  he went in to make inquiri  in the bar parlour he rang the bell  and had to wait some littl time for a repli to it  the onli other person present was a lean man with close red hair and loos  horsey  look cloth  who was drink veri bad whiski  but smoke a veri good cigar  the whiski  of cours  was the choic brand of the champion arm  the cigar he had probabl brought with him from london  noth could be more differ than his cynic neglig from the dapper dryness of the young american  but someth in his pencil and open notebook  and perhap in the express of his alert blue eye  caus kidd to guess  correct  that he was a brother journalist   could you do me the favour  ask kidd  with the courtesi of his nation   of direct me to the grey cottag  where mr boulnoi live  as i understand   it  s a few yard down the road  said the red  hair man  remov his cigar   i shall be pass it myself in a minut  but i  m go on to pendragon park to tri and see the fun   what is pendragon park  ask calhoun kidd   sir claud champion  s place  haven  t you come down for that  too  ask the other pressman  look up   you  re a journalist  aren  t you   i have come to see mr boulnoi  said kidd   i  ve come to see mrs boulnoi  repli the other   but i shan  t catch her at home  and he laugh rather unpleas   are you interest in catastroph  ask the wonder yanke   i  m interest in catastroph  and there are go to be some  repli his companion gloomili   mine  s a filthi trade  and i never pretend it isn  t  with that he spat on the floor  yet somehow in the veri act and instant one could realiz that the man had been brought up as a gentleman  the american pressman consid him with more attent  his face was pale and dissip  with the promis of formid passion yet to be loos  but it was a clever and sensit face  his cloth were coars and careless  but he had a good seal ring on one of his long  thin finger  his name  which came out in the cours of talk  was jame dalroy  he was the son of a bankrupt irish landlord  and attach to a pink paper which he heartili despis  call smart societi  in the capac of report and of someth pain like a spi  smart societi  i regret to say  felt none of that interest in boulnoi on darwin which was such a credit to the head and heart of the western sun  dalroy had come down  it seem  to snuff up the scent of a scandal which might veri well end in the divorc court  but which was at present hover between grey cottag and pendragon park  sir claud champion was known to the reader of the western sun as well as mr boulnoi  so were the pope and the derbi winner  but the idea of their intim acquaintanceship would have struck kidd as equal incongru  he had heard of  and written about  nay  fals pretend to know  sir claud champion  as  one of the brightest and wealthiest of england  s upper ten  as the great sportsman who race yacht round the world  as the great travel who wrote book about the himalaya  as the politician who swept constitu with a startl sort of tori democraci  and as the great dabbler in art  music  literatur  and  abov all  act  sir claud was realli rather magnific in other than american eye  there was someth of the renasc princ about his omnivor cultur and restless public  he was not onli a great amateur  but an ardent one  there was in him none of that antiquarian frivol that we convey by the word  dilettant  that faultless falcon profil with purpl  black italian eye  which had been snap  shot so often both for smart societi and the western sun  gave everyon the impress of a man eaten by ambit as by a fire  or even a diseas  but though kidd knew a great deal about sir claud  a great deal more  in fact  than there was to know  it would never have cross his wildest dream to connect so showi an aristocrat with the newli  unearth founder of catastroph  or to guess that sir claud champion and john boulnoi could be intim friend  such  accord to dalroy  s account  was nevertheless the fact  the two had hunt in coupl at school and colleg  and  though their social destini had been veri differ  for champion was a great landlord and almost a millionair  while boulnoi was a poor scholar and  until just late  an unknown one  they still kept in veri close touch with each other  inde  boulnoi  s cottag stood just outsid the gate of pendragon park  but whether the two men could be friend much longer was becom a dark and ugli question  a year or two befor  boulnoi had marri a beauti and not unsuccess actress  to whom he was devot in his own shi and ponder style  and the proxim of the household to champion  s had given that flighti celebr opportun for behav in a way that could not but caus pain and rather base excit  sir claud had carri the art of public to perfect  and he seem to take a crazi pleasur in be equal ostentati in an intrigu that could do him no sort of honour  footmen from pendragon were perpetu leav bouquet for mrs boulnoi  carriag and motor  car were perpetu call at the cottag for mrs boulnoi  ball and masquerad perpetu fill the ground in which the baronet parad mrs boulnoi  like the queen of love and beauti at a tournament  that veri even  mark by mr kidd for the exposit of catastroph  had been mark by sir claud champion for an open  air render of romeo and juliet  in which he was to play romeo to a juliet it was needless to name   i don  t think it can go on without a smash  said the young man with red hair  get up and shake himself   old boulnoi may be squar  or he may be squar  but if he  s squar he  s thick  what you might call cubic  but i don  t believ it  s possibl   he is a man of grand intellectu power  said calhoun kidd in a deep voic   yes  answer dalroy   but even a man of grand intellectu power can  t be such a blight fool as all that  must you be go on  i shall be follow myself in a minut or two  but calhoun kidd  have finish a milk and soda  betook himself smart up the road toward the grey cottag  leav his cynic inform to his whiski and tobacco  the last of the daylight had fade  the sky were of a dark  green  grey  like slate  stud here and there with a star  but lighter on the left side of the sky  with the promis of a rise moon  the grey cottag  which stood entrench  as it were  in a squar of stiff  high thorn  hedg  was so close under the pine and palisad of the park that kidd at first mistook it for the park lodg  find the name on the narrow wooden gate  howev  and see by his watch that the hour of the  thinker  s  appoint had just struck  he went in and knock at the front door  insid the garden hedg  he could see that the hous  though unpretenti enough  was larger and more luxuri than it look at first  and was quit a differ kind of place from a porter  s lodg  a dog  kennel and a beehiv stood outsid  like symbol of old english countri  life  the moon was rise behind a plantat of prosper pear tree  the dog that came out of the kennel was reverend  look and reluct to bark  and the plain  elder man  servant who open the door was brief but dignifi   mr boulnoi ask me to offer his apolog  sir  he said   but he has been oblig to go out sudden   but see here  i had an appoint  said the interview  with a rise voic   do you know where he went to   to pendragon park  sir  said the servant  rather sombr  and began to close the door  kidd start a littl   did he go with mrs  with the rest of the parti  he ask rather vagu   no  sir  said the man short   he stay behind  and then went out alon  and he shut the door  brutal  but with an air of duti not done  the american  that curious compound of impud and sensit  was annoy  he felt a strong desir to hustl them all along a bit and teach them busi habit  the hoari old dog and the grizzl  heavi  face old butler with his prehistor shirt  front  and the drowsi old moon  and abov all the scatter  brain old philosoph who couldn  t keep an appoint   if that  s the way he goe on he deserv to lose his wife  s purest devot  said mr calhoun kidd   but perhap he  s gone over to make a row  in that case i reckon a man from the western sun will be on the spot  and turn the corner by the open lodg  gate  he set off  stump up the long avenu of black pine  wood that point in abrupt perspect toward the inner garden of pendragon park  the tree were as black and order as plume upon a hears  there were still a few star  he was a man with more literari than direct natur associ  the word  ravenswood  came into his head repeat  it was part the raven colour of the pine  wood  but part also an indescrib atmospher almost describ in scott  s great tragedi  the smell of someth that die in the eighteenth centuri  the smell of dank garden and broken urn  of wrong that will never now be right  of someth that is none the less incur sad becaus it is strang unreal  more than onc  as he went up that strang  black road of tragic artific  he stop  startl  think he heard step in front of him  he could see noth in front but the twin sombr wall of pine and the wedg of starlit sky abov them  at first he thought he must have fanci it or been mock by a mere echo of his own tramp  but as he went on he was more and more inclin to conclud  with the remain of his reason  that there realli were other feet upon the road  he thought hazili of ghost  and was surpris how swift he could see the imag of an appropri and local ghost  one with a face as white as pierrot  s  but patch with black  the apex of the triangl of dark  blue sky was grow brighter and bluer  but he did not realiz as yet that this was becaus he was come nearer to the light of the great hous and garden  he onli felt that the atmospher was grow more intens  there was in the sad more violenc and secreci  more  he hesit for the word  and then said it with a jerk of laughter  catastroph  more pine  more pathway slid past him  and then he stood root as by a blast of magic  it is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream  but this time he felt quit certain that he had got into a book  for we human be are use to inappropri thing  we are accustom to the clatter of the incongru  it is a tune to which we can go to sleep  if one appropri thing happen  it wake us up like the pang of a perfect chord  someth happen such as would have happen in such a place in a forgotten tale  over the black pine  wood came fli and flash in the moon a nake sword  such a slender and sparkl rapier as may have fought mani an unjust duel in that ancient park  it fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glisten like a larg needl  he ran like a hare and bent to look at it  seen at close quarter it had rather a showi look  the big red jewel in the hilt and guard were a littl dubious  but there were other red drop upon the blade which were not dubious  he look round wild in the direct from which the dazzl missil had come  and saw that at this point the sabl facad of fir and pine was interrupt by a smaller road at right angl  which  when he turn it  brought him in full view of the long  light hous  with a lake and fountain in front of it  nevertheless  he did not look at this  have someth more interest to look at  abov him  at the angl of the steep green bank of the terrac garden  was one of those small picturesqu surpris common in the old landscap garden  a kind of small round hill or dome of grass  like a giant mole  hill  ring and crown with three concentr fenc of rose  and have a sundial in the highest point in the centr  kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight cling to that idl clock  but he saw someth els cling to it also  for one wild moment  the figur of a man  though he saw it there onli for a moment  though it was outlandish and incred in costum  be clad from neck to heel in tight crimson  with glint of gold  yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was  that white face flung up to heaven  clean  shaven and so unnatur young  like byron with a roman nose  those black curl alreadi grizzl  he had seen the thousand public portrait of sir claud champion  the wild red figur reel an instant against the sundial  the next it had roll down the steep bank and lay at the american  s feet  faint move one arm  a gaudi  unnatur gold ornament on the arm sudden remind kidd of romeo and juliet  of cours the tight crimson suit was part of the play  but there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had roll  that was no part of the play  he had been run through the bodi  mr calhoun kidd shout and shout again  onc more he seem to hear phantasm footstep  and start to find anoth figur alreadi near him  he knew the figur  and yet it terrifi him  the dissip youth who had call himself dalroy had a horribl quiet way with him  if boulnoi fail to keep appoint that had been made  dalroy had a sinist air of keep appoint that hadn  t  the moonlight discolour everyth  against dalroy  s red hair his wan face look not so much white as pale green  all this morbid impression must be kidd  s excus for have cri out  brutal and beyond all reason   did you do this  you devil  jame dalroy smile his unpleas smile  but befor he could speak  the fallen figur made anoth movement of the arm  wave vagu toward the place where the sword fell  then came a moan  and then it manag to speak   boulnoi  boulnoi  i say  boulnoi did it  jealous of me  he was jealous  he was  he was  kidd bent his head down to hear more  and just manag to catch the word   boulnoi  with my own sword  he threw it  again the fail hand wave toward the sword  and then fell rigid with a thud  in kidd rose from it depth all that acrid humour that is the strang salt of the serious of his race   see here  he said sharpli and with command   you must fetch a doctor  this man  s dead   and a priest  too  i suppos  said dalroy in an undecipher manner   all these champion are papist  the american knelt down by the bodi  felt the heart  prop up the head and use some last effort at restor  but befor the other journalist reappear  follow by a doctor and a priest  he was alreadi prepar to assert they were too late   were you too late also  ask the doctor  a solid prosper  look man  with convent moustach and whisker  but a live eye  which dart over kidd dubious   in one sens  drawl the repres of the sun   i was too late to save the man  but i guess i was in time to hear someth of import  i heard the dead man denounc his assassin   and who was the assassin  ask the doctor  draw his eyebrow togeth   boulnoi  said calhoun kidd  and whistl soft  the doctor stare at him gloomili with a redden brow  but he did not contradict  then the priest  a shorter figur in the background  said mild   i understood that mr boulnoi was not come to pendragon park this even   there again  said the yanke grim   i may be in a posit to give the old countri a fact or two  yes  sir  john boulnoi was go to stay in all this even  he fix up a real good appoint there with me  but john boulnoi chang his mind  john boulnoi left his home abrupt and all alon  and came over to this darn park an hour or so ago  his butler told me so  i think we hold what the all  wise polic call a clue  have you sent for them   yes  said the doctor   but we haven  t alarm anyon els yet   doe mrs boulnoi know  ask jame dalroy  and again kidd was conscious of an irrat desir to hit him on his curl mouth   i have not told her  said the doctor gruffli   but here come the polic  the littl priest had step out into the main avenu  and now return with the fallen sword  which look ludicr larg and theatric when attach to his dumpi figur  at onc cleric and commonplac   just befor the polic come  he said apologet   has anyon got a light  the yanke journalist took an electr torch from his pocket  and the priest held it close to the middl part of the blade  which he examin with blink care  then  without glanc at the point or pommel  he hand the long weapon to the doctor   i fear i  m no use here  he said  with a brief sigh   i  ll say good night to you  gentlemen  and he walk away up the dark avenu toward the hous  his hand clasp behind him and his big head bent in cogit  the rest of the group made increas hast toward the lodg  gate  where an inspector and two constabl could alreadi be seen in consult with the lodg  keeper  but the littl priest onli walk slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine  and at last stop dead  on the step of the hous  it was his silent way of acknowledg an equal silent approach  for there came toward him a presenc that might have satisfi even calhoun kidd  s demand for a love and aristocrat ghost  it was a young woman in silveri satin of a renasc design  she had golden hair in two long shine rope  and a face so start pale between them that she might have been chryselephantin  made  that is  like some old greek statu  out of ivori and gold  but her eye were veri bright  and her voic  though low  was confid   father brown  she said   mrs boulnoi  he repli grave  then he look at her and immedi said   i see you know about sir claud   how do you know i know  she ask steadili  he did not answer the question  but ask anoth   have you seen your husband   my husband is at home  she said   he has noth to do with this  again he did not answer  and the woman drew nearer to him  with a curious intens express on her face   shall i tell you someth more  she said  with a rather fear smile   i don  t think he did it  and you don  t either  father brown return her gaze with a long  grave stare  and then nod  yet more grave   father brown  said the ladi   i am go to tell you all i know  but i want you to do me a favour first  will you tell me whi you haven  t jump to the conclus of poor john  s guilt  as all the rest have done  don  t mind what you say  i  i know about the gossip and the appear that are against me  father brown look honest embarrass  and pass his hand across his forehead   two veri littl thing  he said   at least  one  s veri trivial and the other veri vagu  but such as they are  they don  t fit in with mr boulnoi be the murder  he turn his blank  round face up to the star and continu absentmind   to take the vagu idea first  i attach a good deal of import to vagu idea  all those thing that  aren  t evid  are what convinc me  i think a moral imposs the biggest of all imposs  i know your husband onli slight  but i think this crime of his  as general conceiv  someth veri like a moral imposs  pleas do not think i mean that boulnoi could not be so wick  anybodi can be wick  as wick as he choos  we can direct our moral will  but we can  t general chang our instinct tast and way of do thing  boulnoi might commit a murder  but not this murder  he would not snatch romeo  s sword from it romant scabbard  or slay his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar  or leav his bodi among the rose  or fling the sword away among the pine  if boulnoi kill anyon he  d do it quiet and heavili  as he  d do ani other doubt thing  take a tenth glass of port  or read a loos greek poet  no  the romant set is not like boulnoi  it  s more like champion   ah  she said  and look at him with eye like diamond   and the trivial thing was this  said brown   there were finger  print on that sword  finger  print can be detect quit a time after they are made if they  re on some polish surfac like glass or steel  these were on a polish surfac  they were half  way down the blade of the sword  whose print they were i have no earth clue  but whi should anybodi hold a sword half  way down  it was a long sword  but length is an advantag in lung at an enemi  at least  at most enemi  at all enemi except one   except one  she repeat   there is onli one enemi  said father brown   whom it is easier to kill with a dagger than a sword   i know  said the woman   oneself  there was a long silenc  and then the priest said quiet but abrupt   am i right  then  did sir claud kill himself   yes  she said  with a face like marbl   i saw him do it   he die  said father brown   for love of you  an extraordinari express flash across her face  veri differ from piti  modesti  remors  or anyth her companion had expect  her voic becam sudden strong and full   i don  t believ  she said   he ever care about me a rap  he hate my husband   whi  ask the other  and turn his round face from the sky to the ladi   he hate my husband becaus  it is so strang i hard know how to say it  becaus   yes  said brown patient   becaus my husband wouldn  t hate him  father brown onli nod  and seem still to be listen  he differ from most detect in fact and fiction in a small point  he never pretend not to understand when he understood perfect well  mrs boulnoi drew near onc more with the same contain glow of certainti   my husband  she said   is a great man  sir claud champion was not a great man  he was a celebr and success man  my husband has never been celebr or success  and it is the solemn truth that he has never dream of be so  he no more expect to be famous for think than for smoke cigar  on all that side he has a sort of splendid stupid  he has never grown up  he still like champion exact as he like him at school  he admir him as he would admir a conjur trick done at the dinner  tabl  but he couldn  t be got to conceiv the notion of envi champion  and champion want to be envi  he went mad and kill himself for that   yes  said father brown   i think i begin to understand   oh  don  t you see  she cri   the whole pictur is made for that  the place is plan for it  champion put john in a littl hous at his veri door  like a depend  to make him feel a failur  he never felt it  he think no more about such thing than  than an absent  mind lion  champion would burst in on john  s shabbiest hour or homeliest meal with some dazzl present or announc or expedit that made it like the visit of haroun alraschid  and john would accept or refus amiabl with one eye off  so to speak  like one lazi schoolboy agre or disagre with anoth  after five year of it john had not turn a hair  and sir claud champion was a monomaniac   and haman began to tell them  said father brown   of all the thing wherein the king had honour him  and he said   all these thing profit me noth while i see mordecai the jew sit in the gate   the crisi came  mrs boulnoi continu   when i persuad john to let me take down some of his specul and send them to a magazin  they began to attract attent  especi in america  and one paper want to interview him  when champion  who was interview near everi day  heard of this late littl crumb of success fall to his unconsci rival  the last link snap that held back his devilish hatr  then he began to lay that insan sieg to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire  you will ask me whi i allow such atroci attent  i answer that i could not have declin them except by explain to my husband  and there are some thing the soul cannot do  as the bodi cannot fli  nobodi could have explain to my husband  nobodi could do it now  if you said to him in so mani word   champion is steal your wife  he would think the joke a littl vulgar  that it could be anyth but a joke  that notion could find no crack in his great skull to get in by  well  john was to come and see us act this even  but just as we were start he said he wouldn  t  he had got an interest book and a cigar  i told this to sir claud  and it was his death  blow  the monomaniac sudden saw despair  he stab himself  cri out like a devil that boulnoi was slay him  he lie there in the garden dead of his own jealousi to produc jealousi  and john is sit in the dine  room read a book  there was anoth silenc  and then the littl priest said   there is onli one weak point  mrs boulnoi  in all your veri vivid account  your husband is not sit in the dine  room read a book  that american report told me he had been to your hous  and your butler told him mr boulnoi had gone to pendragon park after all  her bright eye widen to an almost electr glare  and yet it seem rather bewilder than confus or fear   whi  what can you mean  she cri   all the servant were out of the hous  see the theatric  and we don  t keep a butler  thank good  father brown start and spun half round like an absurd teetotum   what  what  he cri seem galvan into sudden life   look here  i say  can i

imagin that america realli is a place  when father brown reach the hous with the beehiv and the drowsi dog  a small and neat maid  servant show him into the dine  room  where boulnoi sat read by a shade lamp  exact as his wife describ him  a decant of port and a wineglass were at his elbow  and the instant the priest enter he note the long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar   he has been here for half an hour at least  thought father brown  in fact  he had the air of sit where he had sat when his dinner was clear away   don  t get up  mr boulnoi  said the priest in his pleasant  prosaic way   i shan  t interrupt you a moment  i fear i break in on some of your scientif studi   no  said boulnoi   i was read  the bloodi thumb  he said it with neither frown nor smile  and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep and viril indiffer in the man which his wife had call great  he laid down a gori yellow  shocker  without even feel it incongru enough to comment on it humor  john boulnoi was a big  slow  move man with a massiv head  part grey and part bald  and blunt  bur featur  he was in shabbi and veri old  fashion even  dress  with a narrow triangular open of shirt  front  he had

smile   is the littl penanc i have so luckili been let off   be hang  said father brown  xii  the fairi tale of father brown the picturesqu citi and state of heiligwaldenstein was one of those toy kingdom of which certain part of the german empir still consist  it had come under the prussian hegemoni quit late in histori  hard fifti year befor the fine summer day when flambeau and father brown found themselv sit in it garden and drink it beer  there had been not a littl of war and wild justic there within live memori  as soon will be shown  but in mere look at it one could not dismiss that impress of childish which is the most charm side of germani  those littl pantomim  patern monarchi in which a king seem as domest as a cook  the german soldier by the innumer sentri  box look strang like german toy  and the clean  cut battlement of the castl  gild by the sunshin  look the more like the gilt gingerbread  for it was brilliant weather  the sky was as prussian a blue as potsdam itself could requir  but it was yet more like that lavish and glow use of the colour which a child extract from a shill paint  box  even the grey  rib tree look young  for the point bud on them were still pink  and in a pattern against the strong blue look like innumer childish figur  despit his prosaic appear and general practic walk of life  father brown was not without a certain streak of romanc in his composit  though he general kept his daydream to himself  as mani children do  amid the brisk  bright colour of such a day  and in the herald framework of such a town  he did feel rather as if he had enter a fairi tale  he took a childish pleasur  as a younger brother might  in the formid sword  stick which flambeau alway flung as he walk  and which now stood upright besid his tall mug of munich  nay  in his sleepi irrespons  he even found himself eye the knob and clumsi head of his own shabbi umbrella  with some faint memori of the ogr  s club in a colour toy  book  but he never compos anyth in the form of fiction  unless it be the tale that follow   i wonder  he said   whether one would have real adventur in a place like this  if one put oneself in the way  it  s a splendid back  scene for them  but i alway have a kind of feel that they would fight you with pasteboard sabr more than real  horribl sword   you are mistaken  said his friend   in this place they not onli fight with sword  but kill without sword  and there  s wors than that   whi  what do you mean  ask father brown   whi  repli the other   i should say this was the onli place in europ where a man was ever shot without firearm   do you mean a bow and arrow  ask brown in some wonder   i mean a bullet in the brain  repli flambeau   don  t you know the stori of the late princ of this place  it was one of the great polic mysteri about twenti year ago  you rememb  of cours  that this place was forcibl annex at the time of bismarck  s veri earliest scheme of consolid  forcibl  that is  but not at all easili  the empir  or what want to be one  sent princ otto of grossenmark to rule the place in the imperi interest  we saw his portrait in the galleri there  a handsom old gentleman if he  d had ani hair or eyebrow  and hadn  t been wrinkl all over like a vultur  but he had thing to harass him  as i  ll explain in a minut  he was a soldier of distinguish skill and success  but he didn  t have altogeth an easi job with this littl place  he was defeat in sever battl by the celebr arnhold brother  the three guerrilla patriot to whom swinburn wrote a poem  you rememb  wolv with the hair of the ermin  crow that are crown and king  these thing be mani as vermin  yet three shall abid these thing  or someth of that kind  inde  it is by no mean certain that the occup would ever have been success had not one of the three brother  paul  despic  but veri decis declin to abid these thing ani longer  and  by surrend all the secret of the insurrect  ensur it overthrow and his own ultim promot to the post of chamberlain to princ otto  after this  ludwig  the one genuin hero among mr swinburn  s hero  was kill  sword in hand  in the captur of the citi  and the third  heinrich  who  though not a traitor  had alway been tame and even timid compar with his activ brother  retir into someth like a hermitag  becam convert to a christian quietism which was almost quakerish  and never mix with men except to give near all he had to the poor  they tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about the neighbourhood occasion  a man in a black cloak  near blind  with veri wild  white hair  but a face of astonish soft   i know  said father brown   i saw him onc  his friend look at him in some surpris   i didn  t know you  d been here befor  he said   perhap you know as much about it as i do  anyhow  that  s the stori of the arnhold  and he was the last survivor of them  yes  and of all the men who play part in that drama   you mean that the princ  too  die long befor   die  repeat flambeau   and that  s about as much as we can say  you must understand that toward the end of his life he began to have those trick of the nerv not uncommon with tyrant  he multipli the ordinari daili and night guard round his castl till there seem to be more sentri  box than hous in the town  and doubt charact were shot without merci  he live almost entir in a littl room that was in the veri centr of the enorm labyrinth of all the other room  and even in this he erect anoth sort of central cabin or cupboard  line with steel  like a safe or a battleship  some say that under the floor of this again was a secret hole in the earth  no more than larg enough to hold him  so that  in his anxieti to avoid the grave  he was will to go into a place pretti much like it  but he went further yet  the populac had been suppos to be disarm ever sinc the suppress of the revolt  but otto now insist  as govern veri seldom insist  on an absolut and liter disarma  it was carri out  with extraordinari thorough and sever  by veri well  organ offici over a small and familiar area  and  so far as human strength and scienc can be absolut certain of anyth  princ otto was absolut certain that nobodi could introduc so much as a toy pistol into heiligwaldenstein   human scienc can never be quit certain of thing like that  said father brown  still look at the red bud of the branch over his head   if onli becaus of the difficulti about definit and connot  what is a weapon  peopl have been murder with the mildest domest comfort  certain with tea  kettl  probabl with tea  cosi  on the other hand  if you show an ancient briton a revolv  i doubt if he would know it was a weapon  until it was fire into him  of cours  perhap somebodi introduc a firearm so new that it didn  t even look like a firearm  perhap it look like a thimbl or someth  was the bullet at all peculiar   not that i ever heard of  answer flambeau   but my inform is fragmentari  and onli come from my old friend grimm  he was a veri abl detect in the german servic  and he tri to arrest me  i arrest him instead  and we had mani interest chat  he was in charg here of the inquiri about princ otto  but i forgot to ask him anyth about the bullet  accord to grimm  what happen was this  he paus a moment to drain the greater part of his dark lager at a draught  and then resum   on the even in question  it seem  the princ was expect to appear in one of the outer room  becaus he had to receiv certain visitor whom he realli wish to meet  they were geolog expert sent to investig the old question of the alleg suppli of gold from the rock round here  upon which  as it was said  the small citi  state had so long maintain it credit and been abl to negoti with it neighbour even under the ceaseless bombard of bigger armi  hitherto it had never been found by the most exact inquiri which could   which could be quit certain of discov a toy pistol  said father brown with a smile   but what about the brother who rat  hadn  t he anyth to tell the princ   he alway assever that he did not know  repli flambeau   that this was the one secret his brother had not told him  it is onli right to say that it receiv some support from fragmentari word  spoken by the great ludwig in the hour of death  when he look at heinrich but point at paul  and said   you have not told him  and was soon afterward incap of speech  anyhow  the deput of distinguish geologist and mineralogist from pari and berlin were there in the most magnific and appropri dress  for there are no men who like wear their decor so much as the men of scienc  as anybodi know who has ever been to a soire of the royal societi  it was a brilliant gather  but veri late  and gradual the chamberlain  you saw his portrait  too  a man with black eyebrow  serious eye  and a meaningless sort of smile underneath  the chamberlain  i say  discov there was everyth there except the princ himself  he search all the outer salon  then  rememb the man  s mad fit of fear  hurri to the inmost chamber  that also was empti  but the steel turret or cabin erect in the middl of it took some time to open  when it did open it was empti  too  he went and look into the hole in the ground  which seem deeper and somehow all the more like a grave  that is his account  of cours  and even as he did so he heard a burst of cri and tumult in the long room and corridor without   first it was a distant din and thrill of someth unthink on the horizon of the crowd  even beyond the castl  next it was a wordless clamour startl close  and loud enough to be distinct if each word had not kill the other  next came word of a terribl clear  come nearer  and next one man  rush into the room and tell the news as briefli as such news is told   otto  princ of heiligwaldenstein and grossenmark  was lie in the dew of the darken twilight in the wood beyond the castl  with his arm flung out and his face flung up to the moon  the blood still puls from his shatter templ and jaw  but it was the onli part of him that move like a live thing  he was clad in his full white and yellow uniform  as to receiv his guest within  except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay rather crumpl by his side  befor he could be lift he was dead  but  dead or aliv  he was a riddl  he who had alway hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet wood  unarm and alon   who found his bodi  ask father brown   some girl attach to the court name hedwig von someth or other  repli his friend   who had been out in the wood pick wild flower   had she pick ani  ask the priest  stare rather vacant at the veil of the branch abov him   yes  repli flambeau   i particular rememb that the chamberlain  or old grimm or somebodi  said how horribl it was  when they came up at her call  to see a girl hold spring flower and bend over that  that bloodi collaps  howev  the main point is that befor help arriv he was dead  and the news  of cours  had to be carri back to the castl  the constern it creat was someth beyond even that natur in a court at the fall of a potent  the foreign visitor  especi the mine expert  were in the wildest doubt and excit  as well as mani import prussian offici  and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for find the treasur bulk much bigger in the busi than peopl had suppos  expert and offici had been promis great prize or intern advantag  and some even said that the princ  s secret apart and strong militari protect were due less to fear of the populac than to the pursuit of some privat investig of   had the flower got long stalk  ask father brown  flambeau stare at him   what an odd person you are  he said   that  s exact what old grimm said  he said the ugliest part of it  he thought  uglier than the blood and bullet  was that the flower were quit short  pluck close under the head   of cours  said the priest   when a grown up girl is realli pick flower  she pick them with plenti of stalk  if she just pull their head off  as a child doe  it look as if  and he hesit   well  inquir the other   well  it look rather as if she had snatch them nervous  to make an excus for be there after  well  after she was there   i know what you  re drive at  said flambeau rather gloomili   but that and everi other suspicion break down on the one point  the want of a weapon  he could have been kill  as you say  with lot of other thing  even with his own militari sash  but we have to explain not bow he was kill  but how he was shot  and the fact is we can  t  they had the girl most ruthless search  for  to tell the truth  she was a littl suspect  though the niec and ward of the wick old chamberlain  paul arnhold  but she was veri romant  and was suspect of sympathi with the old revolutionari enthusiasm in her famili  all the same  howev romant you are  you can  t imagin a big bullet into a man  s jaw or brain without use a gun or pistol  and there was no pistol  though there were two pistol shot  i leav it to you  my friend   how do you know there were two shot  ask the littl priest   there was onli one in his head  said his companion   but there was anoth bullet  hole in the sash  father brown  s smooth brow becam sudden constrict   was the other bullet found  he demand  flambeau start a littl   i don  t think i rememb  he said   hold on  hold on  hold on  cri brown  frown more and more  with a quit unusu concentr of curios   don  t think me rude  let me think this out for a moment   all right  said flambeau  laugh  and finish his beer  a slight breez stir the bud tree and blew up into the sky cloudlet of white and pink that seem to make the sky bluer and the whole colour scene more quaint  they might have been cherub fli home to the casement of a sort of celesti nurseri  the oldest tower of the castl  the dragon tower  stood up as grotesqu as the ale  mug  but as home  onli beyond the tower glimmer the wood in which the man had lain dead   what becam of this hedwig eventu  ask the priest at last   she is marri to general schwartz  said flambeau   no doubt you  ve heard of his career  which was rather romant  he had distinguish himself even  befor his exploit at sadowa and gravelott  in fact  he rose from the rank  which is veri unusu even in the smallest of the german  father brown sat up sudden   rose from the rank  he cri  and made a mouth as if to whistl   well  well  what a queer stori  what a queer way of kill a man  but i suppos it was the onli one possibl  but to think of hate so patient   what do you mean  demand the other   in what way did they kill the man   they kill him with the sash  said brown care  and then  as flambeau protest   yes  yes  i know about the bullet  perhap i ought to say he die of have a sash  i know it doesn  t sound like have a diseas   i suppos  said flambeau   that you  ve got some notion in your head  but it won  t easili get the bullet out of his  as i explain befor  he might easili have been strangl  but he was shot  by whom  by what   he was shot by his own order  said the priest   you mean he commit suicid   i didn  t say by his own wish  repli father brown   i said by his own order   well  anyhow  what is your theori  father brown laugh   i am onli on my holiday  he said   i haven  t got ani theori  onli this place remind me of fairi stori  and  if you like  i  ll tell you a stori  the littl pink cloud  that look rather like sweet  stuff  had float up to crown the turret of the gilt gingerbread castl  and the pink babi finger of the bud tree seem spread and stretch to reach them  the blue sky began to take a bright violet of even  when father brown sudden spoke again   it was on a dismal night  with rain still drop from the tree and dew alreadi cluster  that princ otto of grossenmark step hurri out of a side door of the castl and walk swift into the wood  one of the innumer sentri salut him  but he did not notic it  he had no wish to be special notic himself  he was glad when the great tree  grey and alreadi greasi with rain  swallow him up like a swamp  he had deliber chosen the least frequent side of his palac  but even that was more frequent than he like  but there was no particular chanc of offici or diplomat pursuit  for his exit had been a sudden impuls  all the full  dress diplomatist he left behind were unimport  he had realiz sudden that he could do without them   his great passion was not the much nobler dread of death  but the strang desir of gold  for this legend of the gold he had left grossenmark and invad heiligwaldenstein  for this and onli this he had bought the traitor and butcher the hero  for this he had long question and cross  question the fals chamberlain  until he had come to the conclus that  touch his ignor  the renegad realli told the truth  for this he had  somewhat reluct  paid and promis money on the chanc of gain the larger amount  and for this he had stolen out of his palac like a thief in the rain  for he had thought of anoth way to get the desir of his eye  and to get it cheap   away at the upper end of a rambl mountain path to which he was make his way  among the pillar rock along the ridg that hang abov the town  stood the hermitag  hard more than a cavern fenc with thorn  in which the third of the great brethren had long hidden himself from the world  he  thought princ otto  could have no real reason for refus to give up the gold  he had known it place for year  and made no effort to find it  even befor his new ascet creed had cut him off from properti or pleasur  true  he had been an enemi  but he now profess a duti of have no enemi  some concess to his caus  some appeal to his principl  would probabl get the mere money secret out of him  otto was no coward  in spite of his network of militari precaut  and  in ani case  his avaric was stronger than his fear  nor was there much caus for fear  sinc he was certain there were no privat arm in the whole princip  he was a hundr time more certain there were none in the quaker  s littl hermitag on the hill  where he live on herb  with two old rustic servant  and with no other voic of man for year after year  princ otto look down with someth of a grim smile at the bright  squar labyrinth of the lamp  lit citi below him  for as far as the eye could see there ran the rifl of his friend  and not one pinch of powder for his enemi  rifl rank so close even to that mountain path that a cri from him would bring the soldier rush up the hill  to say noth of the fact that the wood and ridg were patrol at regular interv  rifl so far away  in the dim wood  dwarf by distanc  beyond the river  that an enemi could not slink into the town by ani detour  and round the palac rifl at the west door and the east door  at the north door and the south  and all along the four facad link them  he was safe   it was all the more clear when he had crest the ridg and found how nake was the nest of his old enemi  he found himself on a small platform of rock  broken abrupt by the three corner of precipic  behind was the black cave  mask with green thorn  so low that it was hard to believ that a man could enter it  in front was the fall of the cliff and the vast but cloudi vision of the valley  on the small rock platform stood an old bronz lectern or read  stand  groan under a great german bibl  the bronz or copper of it had grown green with the eat air of that exalt place  and otto had instant the thought   even if they had arm  they must be rust by now  moonris had alreadi made a death dawn behind the crest and crag  and the rain had ceas   behind the lectern  and look across the valley  stood a veri old man in a black robe that fell as straight as the cliff around him  but whose white hair and weak voic seem alik to waver in the wind  he was evid read some daili lesson as part of his religi exercis   they trust in their hors   sir  said the princ of heiligwaldenstein  with quit unusu courtesi   i should like onli one word with you   and in their chariot  went on the old man weak   but we will trust in the name of the lord of host  his last word were inaud  but he close the book rever and  be near blind  made a grope movement and grip the read  stand  instant his two servant slip out of the low  brow cavern and support him  they wore dull  black gown like his own  but they had not the frosti silver on the hair  nor the frost  bitten refin of the featur  they were peasant  croat or magyar  with broad  blunt visag and blink eye  for the first time someth troubl the princ  but his courag and diplomat sens stood firm   i fear we have not met  he said   sinc that aw cannonad in which your poor brother die   all my brother die  said the old man  still look across the valley  then  for one instant turn on otto his droop  delic featur  and the wintri hair that seem to drip over his eyebrow like icicl  he ad   you see  i am dead  too   i hope you  ll understand  said the princ  control himself almost to a point of concili   that i do not come here to haunt you  as a mere ghost of those great quarrel  we will not talk about who was right or wrong in that  but at least there was one point on which we were never wrong  becaus you were alway right  whatev is to be said of the polici of your famili  no one for one moment imagin that you were move by the mere gold  you have prove yourself abov the suspicion that   the old man in the black gown had hitherto continu to gaze at him with wateri blue eye and a sort of weak wisdom in his face  but when the word  gold  was said he held out his hand as if in arrest of someth  and turn away his face to the mountain   he has spoken of gold  he said   he has spoken of thing not law  let him ceas to speak   otto had the vice of his prussian type and tradit  which is to regard success not as an incid but as a qualiti  he conceiv himself and his like as perpetu conquer peopl who were perpetu be conquer  consequ  he was ill acquaint with the emot of surpris  and ill prepar for the next movement  which startl and stiffen him  he had open his mouth to answer the hermit  when the mouth was stop and the voic strangl by a strong  soft gag sudden twist round his head like a tourniquet  it was fulli forti second befor he even realiz that the two hungarian servant had done it  and that they had done it with his own militari scarf   the old man went again weak to his great brazen  support bibl  turn over the leav  with a patienc that had someth horribl about it  till he came to the epistl of st jame  and then began to read   the tongu is a littl member  but   someth in the veri voic made the princ turn sudden and plung down the mountain  path he had climb  he was half  way toward the garden of the palac befor he even tri to tear the strangl scarf from his neck and jaw  he tri again and again  and it was imposs  the men who had knot that gag knew the differ between what a man can do with his hand in front of him and what he can do with his hand behind his head  his leg were free to leap like an antelop on the mountain  his arm were free to use ani gestur or wave ani signal  but he could not speak  a dumb devil was in him   he had come close to the wood that wall in the castl befor he had quit realiz what his wordless state meant and was meant to mean  onc more he look down grim at the bright  squar labyrinth of the lamp  lit citi below him  and he smile no more  he felt himself repeat the phrase of his former mood with a murder ironi  far as the eye could see ran the rifl of his friend  everi one of whom would shoot him dead if he could not answer the challeng  rifl were so near that the wood and ridg could be patrol at regular interv  therefor it was useless to hide in the wood till morn  rifl were rank so far away that an enemi could not slink into the town by ani detour  therefor it was vain to return to the citi by ani remot cours  a cri from him would bring his soldier rush up the hill  but from him no cri would come   the moon had risen in strengthen silver  and the sky show in stripe of bright  nocturn blue between the black stripe of the pine about the castl  flower of some wide and featheri sort  for he had never notic such thing befor  were at onc lumin and discolour by the moonshin  and seem indescrib fantast as they cluster  as if crawl about the root of the tree  perhap his reason had been sudden unseat by the unnatur captiv he carri with him  but in that wood he felt someth unfathom german  the fairi tale  he knew with half his mind that he was draw near to the castl of an ogr  he had forgotten that he was the ogr  he rememb ask his mother if bear live in the old park at home  he stoop to pick a flower  as if it were a charm against enchant  the stalk was stronger than he expect  and broke with a slight snap  care tri to place it in his scarf  he heard the halloo   who goe there  then he rememb the scarf was not in it usual place   he tri to scream and was silent  the second challeng came  and then a shot that shriek as it came and then was still sudden by impact  otto of grossenmark lay veri peac among the fairi tree  and would do no more harm either with gold or steel  onli the silver pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the intric ornament of his uniform  or the old wrinkl on his brow  may god have merci on his soul   the sentri who had fire  accord to the strict order of the garrison  natur ran forward to find some trace of his quarri  he was a privat name schwartz  sinc not unknown in his profess  and what he found was a bald man in uniform  but with his face so bandag by a kind of mask made of his own militari scarf that noth but open  dead eye could be seen  glitter stonili in the moonlight  the bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw  that is whi there was a shot  hole in the scarf  but onli one shot  natur  if not correct  young schwartz tore off the mysteri silken mask and cast it on the grass  and then he saw whom he had slain   we cannot be certain of the next phase  but i inclin to believ that there was a fairi tale  after all  in that littl wood  horribl as was it occas  whether the young ladi name hedwig had ani previous knowledg of the soldier she save and eventu marri  or whether she came accident upon the accid and their intimaci began that night  we shall probabl never know  but we can know  i fanci  that this hedwig was a heroin  and deserv to marri a man who becam someth of a hero  she did the bold and the wise thing  she persuad the sentri to go back to his post  in which place there was noth to connect him with the disast  he was but one of the most loyal and order of fifti such sentri within call  she remain by the bodi and gave the alarm  and there was noth to connect her with the disast either  sinc she had not got  and could not have  ani firearm   well  said father brown rise cheer  i hope they  re happi   where are you go  ask his friend   i  m go to have anoth look at that portrait of the chamberlain  the arnhold who betray his brethren  answer the priest   i wonder what part  i wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is twice a traitor  and he rumin long befor the portrait of a white  hair man with black eyebrow and a pink  paint sort of smile that seem to contradict the black warn in his eye
