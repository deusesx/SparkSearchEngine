applaus are for some new honor  that are heap  d on caesar cassi  whi man  he doth bestrid the narrow world like a colossus  and we petti men walk vnder his huge legg  and peep about to find our selu dishonour graue  men at sometim  are master of their fate  the fault  deer brutus  is not in our starr  but in our selu  that we are vnderl  brutus and caesar  what should be in that caesar  whi should that name be sound more then your write them togeth  your  is as fair a name  sound them  it doth becom the mouth aswel  weigh them  it is as heauy  coniur with  em  brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar  now in the name of all the god at onc  vpon what meat doth this our caesar feed  that he is grown so great  age  thou art sham  d  rome  thou hast lost the breed of nobl blood  when went there by an age  sinc the great flood  but it was fam  d with more then with one man  when could they say  till now  that talk  d of rome  that her wide walk incompast but one man  now is it rome inde  and room enough when there is in it but one one man  o  you and i  haue heard our father say  there was a brutus onc  that would haue brook  d th  eternal diuell to keep his state in rome  as easili as a king bru  that you do loue me  i am noth iealous  what you would work me too  i haue some aym  how i haue thought of this  and of these time i shall recount heereaft  for this present  i would not so  with loue i might intreat you  be ani further moou  d  what you haue said  i will consid  what you haue to say i will with patienc hear  and find a time both meet to hear  and answer such high thing  till then  my nobl friend  chew vpon this  brutus had rather be a villag  then to reput himself a sonn of rome vnder these hard condit  as this time is like to lay vpon vs cassi  i am glad that my weak word haue struck but thus much shew of fire from brutus  enter caesar and his train  bru  the game are done  and caesar is return cassi  as they pass by  pluck caska by the sleeue

chidden train  calphurnia  s cheek is pale  and cicero look with such ferret  and such fieri eye as we haue seen him in the capitol be crost in confer  by some senat cassi  caska will tell vs what the matter is cae antonio ant  caesar cae let me haue men about me  that are fat  sleek  head men  and such as sleep a  night  yond cassius has a lean and hungri look  he think too much  such men are danger ant  fear him not caesar  he  s not danger  he is a nobl roman  and well giuen cae would he were fatter  but i fear him not  yet if my name were lyabl to fear  i do not know the man i should auoyd so soon as that spare cassius  he read much  he is a great obseru  and he look quit through the deed of men  he loue no play  as thou dost antoni  he hear no musick  seldom he smile  and smile in such a sort as if he mock  d himself  and scorn  d his spirit that could be mou  d to smile at ani thing  such men as he  be neuer at heart eas  while they behold a greater then themselu  and therefor are they veri danger  i rather tell thee what is to be fear  d  then what i fear  for alway i am caesar  come on my right hand  for this ear is deaf  and tell me trueli  what thou think  st

caska  i can as well bee hang  d as tell the manner of it  it was meer fooleri  i did not mark it  i saw mark antoni offer him a crown  yet  twas not a crown neyther   twas one of these coronet  and as i told you  hee put it by onc  but for all that  to my think  he would fain haue had it  then hee offer it to him again  then hee put it by again  but to my think  he was veri loath to lay his finger off it  and then he offer it the third time  hee put it the third time by  and still as hee refus  d it  the rabblement howt  and clapp  d their chopt hand  and threw vppe their sweati night  capp  and vttere such a deal of stink breath  becaus caesar refus  d the crown  that it had  almost  choak caesar  for hee swoond  and fell down at it  and for mine own part  i durst not laugh  for fear of open my lipp  and receyu the bad ayr cassi  but soft i pray you  what  did caesar swound  cask  he fell down in the market  place  and foam  d at mouth  and was speechless brut   tis veri like he hath the fall sickness cassi  no  caesar hath it not  but you  and i  and honest caska  we haue the fall sickness cask  i know not what you mean by that  but i am sure caesar fell down  if the tag  ragg peopl did not clap him  and hiss him  accord as he plea  d  and displea  d them  as they vse to doe the player in the theatr  i am no true man brut  what said he  when he came vnto himself  cask  marri  befor he fell down  when he perceiu  d the common heard was glad he refus  d the crown  he pluckt me ope his doublet  and offer  d them his throat to cut  and i had been a man of ani occup  if i would not haue taken him at a word  i would i might goe to hell among the rogu  and so hee fell  when he came to himself again  hee said  if hee had done  or said ani thing amiss  he desir  d their worship to think it was his infirmiti  three or four wench where i stood  cri  alass good soul  and forgau him with all their heart  but there  s no heed to be taken of them  if caesar had stab  d their mother  they would haue done no less brut  and after that  he came thus sad away cask  i cassi  did cicero say ani thing  cask  i  he spoke greek cassi  to what effect  cask  nay  and i tell you that  ile ne  re look you i  th  face again  but those that vnderstood him  smil  d at one anoth  and shook their head  but for mine own part  it was greek to me  i could tell you more new too
