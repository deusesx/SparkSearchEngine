 sens and sensibl by jane austen 1811  chapter 1 the famili of dashwood had long been settl in sussex  their estat was larg  and their resid was at norland park  in the centr of their properti  where  for mani generat  they had live in so respect a manner as to engag the general good opinion of their surround acquaint  the late owner of this estat was a singl man  who live to a veri advanc age  and who for mani year of his life  had a constant companion and housekeep in his sister  but her death  which happen ten year befor his own  produc a great alter in his home  for to suppli her loss  he invit and receiv into his hous the famili of his nephew mr  henri dashwood  the legal inheritor of the norland estat  and the person to whom he intend to bequeath it  in the societi of his nephew and niec  and their children  the old gentleman  s day were comfort spent  his attach to them all increas  the constant attent of mr  and mrs  henri dashwood to his wish  which proceed not mere from interest  but from good of heart  gave him everi degre of solid comfort which his age could receiv  and the cheer of the children ad a relish to his exist  by a former marriag  mr  henri dashwood had one son  by his present ladi  three daughter  the son  a steadi respect young man  was ampli provid for by the fortun of his mother  which had been larg  and half of which devolv on him on his come of age  by his own marriag  likewis  which happen soon afterward  he ad to his wealth  to him therefor the success to the norland estat was not so realli import as to his sister  for their fortun  independ of what might aris to them from their father  s inherit that properti  could be but small  their mother had noth  and their father onli seven thousand pound in his own dispos  for the remain moieti of his first wife  s fortun was also secur to her child  and he had onli a life  interest in it  the old gentleman die  his will was read  and like almost everi other will  gave as much disappoint as pleasur  he was neither so unjust  nor so ungrat  as to leav his estat from his nephew  but he left it to him on such term as destroy half the valu of the bequest  mr  dashwood had wish for it more for the sake of his wife and daughter than for himself or his son  but to his son  and his son  s son  a child of four year old  it was secur  in such a way  as to leav to himself no power of provid for those who were most dear to him  and who most need a provis by ani charg on the estat  or by ani sale of it valuabl wood  the whole was tie up for the benefit of this child  who  in occasion visit with his father and mother at norland  had so far gain on the affect of his uncl  by such attract as are by no mean unusu in children of two or three year old  an imperfect articul  an earnest desir of have his own way  mani cun trick  and a great deal of nois  as to outweigh all the valu of all the attent which  for year  he had receiv from his niec and her daughter  he meant not to be unkind  howev  and  as a mark of his affect for the three girl  he left them a thousand pound a  piec  mr  dashwood  s disappoint was  at first  sever  but his temper was cheer and sanguin  and he might reason hope to live mani year  and by live econom  lay by a consider sum from the produc of an estat alreadi larg  and capabl of almost immedi improv  but the fortun  which had been so tardi in come  was his onli one twelvemonth  he surviv his uncl no longer  and ten thousand pound  includ the late legaci  was all that remain for his widow and daughter  his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known  and to him mr  dashwood recommend  with all the strength and urgenc which ill could command  the interest of his mother  in  law and sister  mr  john dashwood had not the strong feel of the rest of the famili  but he was affect by a recommend of such a natur at such a time  and he promis to do everi thing in his power to make them comfort  his father was render easi by such an assur  and mr  john dashwood had then leisur to consid how much there might prudent be in his power to do for them  he was not an ill  dispos young man  unless to be rather cold heart and rather selfish is to be ill  dispos  but he was  in general  well respect  for he conduct himself with proprieti in the discharg of his ordinari duti  had he marri a more amiabl woman  he might have been made still more respect than he was  he might even have been made amiabl himself  for he was veri young when he marri  and veri fond of his wife  but mrs  john dashwood was a strong caricatur of himself  more narrow  mind and selfish  when he gave his promis to his father  he medit within himself to increas the fortun of his sister by the present of a thousand pound a  piec  he then realli thought himself equal to it  the prospect of four thousand a  year  in addit to his present incom  besid the remain half of his own mother  s fortun  warm his heart  and made him feel capabl of generos   yes  he would give them three thousand pound  it would be liber and handsom  it would be enough to make them complet easi  three thousand pound  he could spare so consider a sum with littl inconveni  he thought of it all day long  and for mani day success  and he did not repent  no sooner was his father  s funer over  than mrs  john dashwood  without send ani notic of her intent to her mother  in  law  arriv with her child and their attend  no one could disput her right to come  the hous was her husband  s from the moment of his father  s deceas  but the indelicaci of her conduct was so much the greater  and to a woman in mrs  dashwood  s situat  with onli common feel  must have been high unpleas  but in her mind there was a sens of honor so keen  a generos so romant  that ani offenc of the kind  by whomsoev given or receiv  was to her a sourc of immov disgust  mrs  john dashwood had never been a favourit with ani of her husband  s famili  but she had had no opportun  till the present  of shew them with how littl attent to the comfort of other peopl she could act when occas requir it  so acut did mrs  dashwood feel this ungraci behaviour  and so earnest did she despis her daughter  in  law for it  that  on the arriv of the latter  she would have quit the hous for ever  had not the entreati of her eldest girl induc her first to reflect on the proprieti of go  and her own tender love for all her three children determin her afterward to stay  and for their sake avoid a breach with their brother  elinor  this eldest daughter  whose advic was so effectu  possess a strength of understand  and cool of judgment  which qualifi her  though onli nineteen  to be the counsellor of her mother  and enabl her frequent to counteract  to the advantag of them all  that eager of mind in mrs  dashwood which must general have led to imprud  she had an excel heart  her disposit was affection  and her feel were strong  but she knew how to govern them  it was a knowledg which her mother had yet to learn  and which one of her sister had resolv never to be taught  mariann  s abil were  in mani respect  quit equal to elinor  s  she was sensibl and clever  but eager in everyth  her sorrow  her joy  could have no moder  she was generous  amiabl  interest  she was everyth but prudent  the resembl between her and her mother was strike great  elinor saw  with concern  the excess of her sister  s sensibl  but by mrs  dashwood it was valu and cherish  they encourag each other now in the violenc of their afflict  the agoni of grief which overpow them at first  was voluntarili renew  was sought for  was creat again and again  they gave themselv up wholli to their sorrow  seek increas of wretched in everi reflect that could afford it  and resolv against ever admit consol in futur  elinor  too  was deepli afflict  but still she could struggl  she could exert herself  she could consult with her brother  could receiv her sister  in  law on her arriv  and treat her with proper attent  and could strive to rous her mother to similar exert  and encourag her to similar forbear  margaret  the other sister  was a good  humor  well  dispos girl  but as she had alreadi imbib a good deal of mariann  s romanc  without have much of her sens  she did not  at thirteen  bid fair to equal her sister at a more advanc period of life  chapter 2 mrs  john dashwood now instal herself mistress of norland  and her mother and sister  in  law were degrad to the condit of visitor  as such  howev  they were treat by her with quiet civil  and by her husband with as much kind as he could feel toward anybodi beyond himself  his wife  and their child  he realli press them  with some earnest  to consid norland as their home  and  as no plan appear so elig to mrs  dashwood as remain there till she could accommod herself with a hous in the neighbourhood  his invit was accept  a continu in a place where everyth remind her of former delight  was exact what suit her mind  in season of cheer  no temper could be more cheer than her  or possess  in a greater degre  that sanguin expect of happi which is happi itself  but in sorrow she must be equal carri away by her fanci  and as far beyond consol as in pleasur she was beyond alloy  mrs  john dashwood did not at all approv of what her husband intend to do for his sister  to take three thousand pound from the fortun of their dear littl boy would be impoverish him to the most dread degre  she beg him to think again on the subject  how could he answer it to himself to rob his child  and his onli child too  of so larg a sum  and what possibl claim could the miss dashwood  who were relat to him onli by half blood  which she consid as no relationship at all  have on his generos to so larg an amount  it was veri well known that no affect was ever suppos to exist between the children of ani man by differ marriag  and whi was he to ruin himself  and their poor littl harri  by give away all his money to his half sister   it was my father  s last request to me  repli her husband   that i should assist his widow and daughter   he did not know what he was talk of  i dare say  ten to one but he was light  head at the time  had he been in his right sens  he could not have thought of such a thing as beg you to give away half your fortun from your own child   he did not stipul for ani particular sum  my dear fanni  he onli request me  in general term  to assist them  and make their situat more comfort than it was in his power to do  perhap it would have been as well if he had left it wholli to myself  he could hard suppos i should neglect them  but as he requir the promis  i could not do less than give it  at least i thought so at the time  the promis  therefor  was given  and must be perform  someth must be done for them whenev they leav norland and settl in a new home   well  then  let someth be done for them  but that someth need not be three thousand pound  consid  she ad   that when the money is onc part with  it never can return  your sister will marri  and it will be gone for ever  if  inde  it could be restor to our poor littl boy   whi  to be sure  said her husband  veri grave   that would make great differ  the time may come when harri will regret that so larg a sum was part with  if he should have a numer famili  for instanc  it would be a veri conveni addit   to be sure it would   perhap  then  it would be better for all parti  if the sum were diminish one half  five hundr pound would be a prodigi increas to their fortun   oh  beyond anyth great  what brother on earth would do half so much for his sister  even if realli his sister  and as it is  onli half blood  but you have such a generous spirit   i would not wish to do ani thing mean  he repli   one had rather  on such occas  do too much than too littl  no one  at least  can think i have not done enough for them  even themselv  they can hard expect more   there is no know what they may expect  said the ladi   but we are not to think of their expect  the question is  what you can afford to do   certain  and i think i may afford to give them five hundr pound a  piec  as it is  without ani addit of mine  they will each have about three thousand pound on their mother  s death  a veri comfort fortun for ani young woman   to be sure it is  and  inde  it strike me that they can want no addit at all  they will have ten thousand pound divid amongst them  if they marri  they will be sure of do well  and if they do not  they may all live veri comfort togeth on the interest of ten thousand pound   that is veri true  and  therefor  i do not know whether  upon the whole  it would not be more advis to do someth for their mother while she live  rather than for them  someth of the annuiti kind i mean  my sister would feel the good effect of it as well as herself  a hundr a year would make them all perfect comfort  his wife hesit a littl  howev  in give her consent to this plan   to be sure  said she   it is better than part with fifteen hundr pound at onc  but  then  if mrs  dashwood should live fifteen year we shall be complet taken in   fifteen year  my dear fanni  her life cannot be worth half that purchas   certain not  but if you observ  peopl alway live for ever when there is an annuiti to be paid them  and she is veri stout and healthi  and hard forti  an annuiti is a veri serious busi  it come over and over everi year  and there is no get rid of it  you are not awar of what you are do  i have known a great deal of the troubl of annuiti  for my mother was clog with the payment of three to old superannu servant by my father  s will  and it is amaz how disagre she found it  twice everi year these annuiti were to be paid  and then there was the troubl of get it to them  and then one of them was said to have die  and afterward it turn out to be no such thing  my mother was quit sick of it  her incom was not her own  she said  with such perpetu claim on it  and it was the more unkind in my father  becaus  otherwis  the money would have been entir at my mother  s dispos  without ani restrict whatev  it has given me such an abhorr of annuiti  that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world   it is certain an unpleas thing  repli mr  dashwood   to have those kind of year drain on one  s incom  one  s fortun  as your mother just say  is not one  s own  to be tie down to the regular payment of such a sum  on everi rent day  is by no mean desir  it take away one  s independ   undoubt  and after all you have no thank for it  they think themselv secur  you do no more than what is expect  and it rais no gratitud at all  if i were you  whatev i did should be done at my own discret entir  i would not bind myself to allow them ani thing year  it may be veri inconveni some year to spare a hundr  or even fifti pound from our own expens   i believ you are right  my love  it will be better that there should by no annuiti in the case  whatev i may give them occasion will be of far greater assist than a year allow  becaus they would onli enlarg their style of live if they felt sure of a larger incom  and would not be sixpenc the richer for it at the end of the year  it will certain be much the best way  a present of fifti pound  now and then  will prevent their ever be distress for money  and will  i think  be ampli discharg my promis to my father   to be sure it will  inde  to say the truth  i am convinc within myself that your father had no idea of your give them ani money at all  the assist he thought of  i dare say  was onli such as might be reason expect of you  for instanc  such as look out for a comfort small hous for them  help them to move their thing  and send them present of fish and game  and so forth  whenev they are in season  i  ll lay my life that he meant noth farther  inde  it would be veri strang and unreason if he did  do but consid  my dear mr  dashwood  how excess comfort your mother  in  law and her daughter may live on the interest of seven thousand pound  besid the thousand pound belong to each of the girl  which bring them in fifti pound a year a  piec  and  of cours  they will pay their mother for their board out of it  altogeth  they will have five hundr a  year amongst them  and what on earth can four women want for more than that  they will live so cheap  their housekeep will be noth at all  they will have no carriag  no hors  and hard ani servant  they will keep no compani  and can have no expens of ani kind  onli conceiv how comfort they will be  five hundr a year  i am sure i cannot imagin how they will spend half of it  and as to your give them more  it is quit absurd to think of it  they will be much more abl to give you someth   upon my word  said mr  dashwood   i believ you are perfect right  my father certain could mean noth more by his request to me than what you say  i clear understand it now  and i will strict fulfil my engag by such act of assist and kind to them as you have describ  when my mother remov into anoth hous my servic shall be readili given to accommod her as far as i can  some littl present of furnitur too may be accept then   certain  return mrs  john dashwood   but  howev  one thing must be consid  when your father and mother move to norland  though the furnitur of stanhil was sold  all the china  plate  and linen was save  and is now left to your mother  her hous will therefor be almost complet fit up as soon as she take it   that is a materi consider undoubt  a valuabl legaci inde  and yet some of the plate would have been a veri pleasant addit to our own stock here   yes  and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsom as what belong to this hous  a great deal too handsom  in my opinion  for ani place they can ever afford to live in  but  howev  so it is  your father thought onli of them  and i must say this  that you owe no particular gratitud to him  nor attent to his wish  for we veri well know that if he could  he would have left almost everyth in the world to them  this argument was irresist  it gave to his intent whatev of decis was want befor  and he final resolv  that it would be absolut unnecessari  if not high indecor  to do more for the widow and children of his father  than such kind of neighbour act as his own wife point out  chapter 3 mrs  dashwood remain at norland sever month  not from ani disinclin to move when the sight of everi well known spot ceas to rais the violent emot which it produc for a while  for when her spirit began to reviv  and her mind becam capabl of some other exert than that of heighten it afflict by melancholi remembr  she was impati to be gone  and indefatig in her inquiri for a suitabl dwell in the neighbourhood of norland  for to remov far from that belov spot was imposs  but she could hear of no situat that at onc answer her notion of comfort and eas  and suit the prudenc of her eldest daughter  whose steadier judgment reject sever hous as too larg for their incom  which her mother would have approv  mrs  dashwood had been inform by her husband of the solemn promis on the part of his son in their favour  which gave comfort to his last earth reflect  she doubt the sincer of this assur no more than he had doubt it himself  and she thought of it for her daughter  sake with satisfact  though as for herself she was persuad that a much smaller provis than 7000l would support her in affluenc  for their brother  s sake  too  for the sake of his own heart  she rejoic  and she reproach herself for be unjust to his merit befor  in believ him incap of generos  his attent behaviour to herself and his sister convinc her that their welfar was dear to him  and  for a long time  she firm reli on the liber of his intent  the contempt which she had  veri earli in their acquaint  felt for her daughter  in  law  was veri much increas by the farther knowledg of her charact  which half a year  s resid in her famili afford  and perhap in spite of everi consider of polit or matern affect on the side of the former  the two ladi might have found it imposs to have live togeth so long  had not a particular circumst occur to give still greater elig  accord to the opinion of mrs  dashwood  to her daughter  continu at norland  this circumst was a grow attach between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs  john dashwood  a gentleman  like and pleas young man  who was introduc to their acquaint soon after his sister  s establish at norland  and who had sinc spent the greatest part of his time there  some mother might have encourag the intimaci from motiv of interest  for edward ferrar was the eldest son of a man who had die veri rich  and some might have repress it from motiv of prudenc  for  except a trifl sum  the whole of his fortun depend on the will of his mother  but mrs  dashwood was alik uninfluenc by either consider  it was enough for her that he appear to be amiabl  that he love her daughter  and that elinor return the partial  it was contrari to everi doctrin of her  s that differ of fortun should keep ani coupl asund who were attract by resembl of disposit  and that elinor  s merit should not be acknowledg by everi one who knew her  was to her comprehens imposs  edward ferrar was not recommend to their good opinion by ani peculiar grace of person or address  he was not handsom  and his manner requir intimaci to make them pleas  he was too diffid to do justic to himself  but when his natur shyness was overcom  his behaviour gave everi indic of an open  affection heart  his understand was good  and his educ had given it solid improv  but he was neither fit by abil nor disposit to answer the wish of his mother and sister  who long to see him distinguish  as  they hard knew what  they want him to make a fine figur in the world in some manner or other  his mother wish to interest him in polit concern  to get him into parliament  or to see him connect with some of the great men of the day  mrs  john dashwood wish it likewis  but in the mean while  till one of these superior bless could be attain  it would have quiet her ambit to see him drive a barouch  but edward had no turn for great men or barouch  all his wish center in domest comfort and the quiet of privat life  fortun he had a younger brother who was more promis  edward had been stay sever week in the hous befor he engag much of mrs  dashwood  s attent  for she was  at that time  in such afflict as render her careless of surround object  she saw onli that he was quiet and unobtrus  and she like him for it  he did not disturb the wretched of her mind by ill  time convers  she was first call to observ and approv him farther  by a reflect which elinor chanc one day to make on the differ between him and his sister  it was a contrast which recommend him most forcibl to her mother   it is enough  said she   to say that he is unlik fanni is enough  it impli everyth amiabl  i love him alreadi   i think you will like him  said elinor   when you know more of him   like him  repli her mother with a smile   i feel no sentiment of approb inferior to love   you may esteem him   i have never yet known what it was to separ esteem and love  mrs  dashwood now took pain to get acquaint with him  her manner were attach  and soon banish his reserv  she speedili comprehend all his merit  the persuas of his regard for elinor perhap assist her penetr  but she realli felt assur of his worth  and even that quiet of manner  which milit against all her establish idea of what a young man  s address ought to be  was no longer uninterest when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affection  no sooner did she perceiv ani symptom of love in his behaviour to elinor  than she consid their serious attach as certain  and look forward to their marriag as rapid approach   in a few month  my dear mariann  said she   elinor will  in all probabl be settl for life  we shall miss her  but she will be happi   oh  mamma  how shall we do without her   my love  it will be scarc a separ  we shall live within a few mile of each other  and shall meet everi day of our live  you will gain a brother  a real  affection brother  i have the highest opinion in the world of edward  s heart  but you look grave  mariann  do you disapprov your sister  s choic   perhap  said mariann   i may consid it with some surpris  edward is veri amiabl  and i love him tender  but yet  he is not the kind of young man  there is someth want  his figur is not strike  it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could serious attach my sister  his eye want all that spirit  that fire  which at onc announc virtu and intellig  and besid all this  i am afraid  mamma  he has no real tast  music seem scarc to attract him  and though he admir elinor  s draw veri much  it is not the admir of a person who can understand their worth  it is evid  in spite of his frequent attent to her while she draw  that in fact he know noth of the matter  he admir as a lover  not as a connoisseur  to satisfi me  those charact must be unit  i could not be happi with a man whose tast did not in everi point coincid with my own  he must enter into all my feel  the same book  the same music must charm us both  oh  mama  how spiritless  how tame was edward  s manner in read to us last night  i felt for my sister most sever  yet she bore it with so much composur  she seem scarc to notic it  i could hard keep my seat  to hear those beauti line which have frequent almost driven me wild  pronounc with such impenetr calm  such dread indiffer   he would certain have done more justic to simpl and eleg prose  i thought so at the time  but you would give him cowper   nay  mamma  if he is not to be anim by cowper  but we must allow for differ of tast  elinor has not my feel  and therefor she may overlook it  and be happi with him  but it would have broke my heart  had i love him  to hear him read with so littl sensibl  mama  the more i know of the world  the more am i convinc that i shall never see a man whom i can realli love  i requir so much  he must have all edward  s virtu  and his person and manner must ornament his good with everi possibl charm   rememb  my love  that you are not seventeen  it is yet too earli in life to despair of such a happi  whi should you be less fortun than your mother  in one circumst onli  my mariann  may your destini be differ from her  s  chapter 4  what a piti it is  elinor  said mariann   that edward should have no tast for draw   no tast for draw  repli elinor   whi should you think so  he doe not draw himself  inde  but he has great pleasur in see the perform of other peopl  and i assur you he is by no mean defici in natur tast  though he has not had opportun of improv it  had he ever been in the way of learn  i think he would have drawn veri well  he distrust his own judgment in such matter so much  that he is alway unwil to give his opinion on ani pictur  but he has an innat proprieti and simplic of tast  which in general direct him perfect right  mariann was afraid of offend  and said no more on the subject  but the kind of approb which elinor describ as excit in him by the draw of other peopl  was veri far from that raptur delight  which  in her opinion  could alon be call tast  yet  though smile within herself at the mistak  she honour her sister for that blind partial to edward which produc it   i hope  mariann  continu elinor   you do not consid him as defici in general tast  inde  i think i may say that you cannot  for your behaviour to him is perfect cordial  and if that were your opinion  i am sure you could never be civil to him  mariann hard knew what to say  she would not wound the feel of her sister on ani account  and yet to say what she did not believ was imposs  at length she repli   do not be offend  elinor  if my prais of him is not in everi thing equal to your sens of his merit  i have not had so mani opportun of estim the minut propens of his mind  his inclin and tast  as you have  but i have the highest opinion in the world of his good and sens  i think him everi thing that is worthi and amiabl   i am sure  repli elinor  with a smile   that his dearest friend could not be dissatisfi with such commend as that  i do not perceiv how you could express yourself more warm  mariann was rejoic to find her sister so easili pleas   of his sens and his good  continu elinor   no one can  i think  be in doubt  who has seen him often enough to engag him in unreserv convers  the excel of his understand and his principl can be conceal onli by that shyness which too often keep him silent  you know enough of him to do justic to his solid worth  but of his minut propens  as you call them you have from peculiar circumst been kept more ignor than myself  he and i have been at time thrown a good deal togeth  while you have been wholli engross on the most affection principl by my mother  i have seen a great deal of him  have studi his sentiment and heard his opinion on subject of literatur and tast  and  upon the whole  i ventur to pronounc that his mind is well  inform  enjoy of book exceed great  his imagin live  his observ just and correct  and his tast delic and pure  his abil in everi respect improv as much upon acquaint as his manner and person  at first sight  his address is certain not strike  and his person can hard be call handsom  till the express of his eye  which are uncommon good  and the general sweet of his counten  is perceiv  at present  i know him so well  that i think him realli handsom  or at least  almost so  what say you  mariann   i shall veri soon think him handsom  elinor  if i do not now  when you tell me to love him as a brother  i shall no more see imperfect in his face  than i now do in his heart  elinor start at this declar  and was sorri for the warmth she had been betray into  in speak of him  she felt that edward stood veri high in her opinion  she believ the regard to be mutual  but she requir greater certainti of it to make mariann  s convict of their attach agreeabl to her  she knew that what mariann and her mother conjectur one moment  they believ the next  that with them  to wish was to hope  and to hope was to expect  she tri to explain the real state of the case to her sister   i do not attempt to deni  said she   that i think veri high of him  that i great esteem  that i like him  mariann here burst forth with indign   esteem him  like him  cold  heart elinor  oh  wors than cold  heart  asham of be otherwis  use those word again  and i will leav the room this moment  elinor could not help laugh   excus me  said she   and be assur that i meant no offenc to you  by speak  in so quiet a way  of my own feel  believ them to be stronger than i have declar  believ them  in short  to be such as his merit  and the suspicion  the hope of his affect for me may warrant  without imprud or folli  but farther than this you must not believ  i am by no mean assur of his regard for me  there are moment when the extent of it seem doubt  and till his sentiment are fulli known  you cannot wonder at my wish to avoid ani encourag of my own partial  by believ or call it more than it is  in my heart i feel littl  scarc ani doubt of his prefer  but there are other point to be consid besid his inclin  he is veri far from be independ  what his mother realli is we cannot know  but  from fanni  s occasion mention of her conduct and opinion  we have never been dispos to think her amiabl  and i am veri much mistaken if edward is not himself awar that there would be mani difficulti in his way  if he were to wish to marri a woman who had not either a great fortun or high rank  mariann was astonish to find how much the imagin of her mother and

satisfi  for though her former style of life render mani addit to the latter indispens  yet to add and improv was a delight to her  and she had at this time readi money enough to suppli all that was want of greater eleg to the apart   as for the hous itself  to be sure  said she   it is too small for our famili  but we will make ourselv toler comfort for the present  as it is too late in the year for improv  perhap in the spring  if i have plenti of money  as i dare say i shall  we may think about build  these parlor are both too small for such parti of our friend as i hope to see often collect here  and i have some thought of throw the passag into one of them with perhap a part of the other  and so leav the remaind of that other for an entranc  this  with a new draw room which may be easili ad  and a bed  chamber and garret abov  will make it a veri snug littl cottag  i could wish the stair were handsom  but one must not expect everi thing  though i suppos it would be no difficult matter to widen them  i shall see how much i am befor  hand with the world in the spring  and we will plan our improv accord  in the mean time  till all these alter could be made from the

counten was thorough good  humour  and his manner were as friend as the style of his letter  their arriv seem to afford him real satisfact  and their comfort to be an object of real solicitud to him  he said much of his earnest desir of their live in the most sociabl term with his famili  and press them so cordial to dine at barton park everi day till they were better settl at home  that  though his entreati were carri to a point of persever beyond civil  they could not give offenc  his kind was not confin to word  for within an hour after he left them  a larg basket full of garden stuff and fruit arriv from the park  which was follow befor the end of the day by a present of game  he insist  moreov  on convey all their letter to and from the post for them  and would not be deni the satisfact of send them his newspap everi day  ladi middleton had sent a veri civil messag by him  denot her intent of wait on mrs  dashwood as soon as she could be assur that her visit would be no inconveni  and as this messag was answer by an invit equal polit  her ladyship was introduc to them the next day  they were  of cours  veri anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend  and the eleg of her appear was favour to their wish  ladi middleton was not more than six or seven and twenti  her face was handsom  her figur tall and strike  and her address grace  her manner had all the eleg which her husband  s want  but they would have been improv by some share of his frank and warmth  and her visit was long enough to detract someth from their first admir  by shew that  though perfect well  bred  she was reserv  cold  and had noth to say for herself beyond the most common  place inquiri or remark  convers howev was not want  for sir john was veri chatti  and ladi middleton had taken the wise precaut of bring with her their eldest child  a fine littl boy about six year old  by which mean there was one subject alway to be recur to by the ladi in case of extrem  for they had to enquir his name and age  admir his beauti  and ask him question which his mother answer for him  while he hung about her and held down his head  to the great surpris of her ladyship  who wonder at his be so shi befor compani  as he could make nois enough at home  on everi formal visit a child ought to be of the parti  by way of provis for discours  in the present case it took up ten minut to determin whether the boy were most like his father or mother  and in what particular he resembl either  for of cours everi bodi differ  and everi bodi was astonish at the opinion of the other  an opportun was soon to be given to the dashwood of debat on the rest of the children  as sir john would not leav the hous without secur their promis of dine at the park the next day  chapter 7 barton park was about half a mile from the cottag  the ladi had pass near it in their way along the valley  but it was screen from their view at home by the project of a hill  the hous was larg and handsom  and the middleton live in a style of equal hospit and eleg  the former was for sir john  s gratif  the latter for that of his ladi  they were scarc ever without some friend stay with them in the hous  and they kept more compani of everi kind than ani other famili in the neighbourhood  it was necessari to the happi of both  for howev dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour  they strong resembl each other in that total want of talent and tast which confin their employ  unconnect with such as societi produc  within a veri narrow compass  sir john was a sportsman  ladi middleton a mother  he hunt and shot  and she humour her children  and these were their onli resourc  ladi middleton had the advantag of be abl to spoil her children all the year round  while sir john  s independ employ were in exist onli half the time  continu engag at home and abroad  howev  suppli all the defici of natur and educ  support the good spirit of sir john  and gave exercis to the good breed of his wife  ladi middleton piqu herself upon the eleg of her tabl  and of all her domest arrang  and from this kind of vaniti was her greatest enjoy in ani of their parti  but sir john  s satisfact in societi was much more real  he delight in collect about him more young peopl than his hous would hold  and the noisier they were the better was he pleas  he was a bless to all the juvenil part of the neighbourhood  for in summer he was for ever form parti to eat cold ham and chicken out of door  and in winter his privat ball were numer enough for ani young ladi who was not suffer under the unsati appetit of fifteen  the arriv of a new famili in the countri was alway a matter of joy to him  and in everi point of view he was charm with the inhabit he had now procur for his cottag at barton  the miss dashwood were young  pretti  and unaffect  it was enough to secur his good opinion  for to be unaffect was all that a pretti girl could want to make her mind as captiv as her person  the friendli of his disposit made him happi in accommod those  whose situat might be consid  in comparison with the past  as unfortun  in show kind to his cousin therefor he had the real satisfact of a good heart  and in settl a famili of femal onli in his cottag  he had all the satisfact of a sportsman  for a sportsman  though he esteem onli those of his sex who are sportsmen likewis  is not often desir of encourag their tast by admit them to a resid within his own manor  mrs  dashwood and her daughter were met at the door of the hous by sir john  who welcom them to barton park with unaffect sincer  and as he attend them to the draw room repeat to the young ladi the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day befor  at be unabl to get ani smart young men to meet them  they would see  he said  onli one gentleman there besid himself  a particular friend who was stay at the park  but who was neither veri young nor veri gay  he hope they would all excus the small of the parti  and could assur them it should never happen so again  he had been to sever famili that morn in hope of procur some addit to their number  but it was moonlight and everi bodi was full of engag  luckili ladi middleton  s mother had arriv at barton within the last hour  and as she was a veri cheer agreeabl woman  he hope the young ladi would not find it so veri dull as they might imagin  the young ladi  as well as their mother  were perfect satisfi with have two entir stranger of the parti  and wish for no more  mrs  jen  ladi middleton  s mother  was a good  humour  merri  fat  elder woman  who talk a great deal  seem veri happi  and rather vulgar  she was full of joke and laughter  and befor dinner was over had said mani witti thing on the subject of lover and husband  hope they had not left their heart behind them in sussex  and pretend to see them blush whether they did or not  mariann was vex at it for her sister  s sake  and turn her eye toward elinor to see how she bore these attack  with an earnest which gave elinor far more pain than could aris from such common  place railleri as mrs  jen  s  colonel brandon  the friend of sir john  seem no more adapt by resembl of manner to be his friend  than ladi middleton was to be his wife  or mrs  jen to be ladi middleton  s mother  he was silent and grave  his appear howev was not unpleas  in spite of his be in the opinion of mariann and margaret an absolut old bachelor  for he was on the wrong side of five and thirti  but though his face was not handsom  his counten was sensibl  and his address was particular gentlemanlik  there was noth in ani of the parti which could recommend them as companion to the dashwood  but the cold insipid of ladi middleton was so particular repuls  that in comparison of it the graviti of colonel brandon  and even the boister mirth of sir john and his mother  in  law was interest  ladi middleton seem to be rous to enjoy onli by the entranc of her four noisi children after dinner  who pull her about  tore her cloth  and put an end to everi kind of discours except what relat to themselv  in the even  as mariann was discov to be music  she was invit to play  the instrument was unlock  everi bodi prepar to be charm  and mariann  who sang veri well  at their request went through the chief of the song which ladi middleton had brought into the famili on her marriag  and which perhap had lain ever sinc in the same posit on the pianofort  for her ladyship had celebr that event by give up music  although by her mother  s account  she had play extrem well  and by her own was veri fond of it  mariann  s perform was high applaud  sir john was loud in his admir at the end of everi song  and as loud in his convers with the other while everi song last  ladi middleton frequent call him to order  wonder how ani one  s attent could be divert from music for a moment  and ask mariann to sing a particular song which mariann had just finish  colonel brandon alon  of all the parti  heard her without be in raptur  he paid her onli the compliment of attent  and she felt a respect for him on the occas  which the other had reason forfeit by their shameless want of tast  his pleasur in music  though it amount not to that ecstat delight which alon could sympath with her own  was estim when contrast against the horribl insens of the other  and she was reason enough to allow that a man of five and thirti might well have outliv all acut of feel and everi exquisit power of enjoy  she was perfect dispos to make everi allow for the colonel  s advanc state of life which human requir  chapter 8 mrs  jen was a widow with an ampl jointur  she had onli two daughter  both of whom she had live to see respect marri  and she had now therefor noth to do but to marri all the rest of the world  in the promot of this object she was zealous activ  as far as her abil reach  and miss no opportun of project wed among all the young peopl of her acquaint  she was remark quick in the discoveri of attach  and had enjoy the advantag of rais the blush and the vaniti of mani a young ladi by insinu of her power over such a young man  and this kind of discern enabl her soon after her arriv at barton decis to pronounc that colonel brandon was veri much in love with mariann dashwood  she rather suspect it to be so  on the veri first even of their be togeth  from his listen so attent while she sang to them  and when the visit was return by the middleton  dine at the cottag  the fact was ascertain by his listen to her again  it must be so  she was perfect convinc of it  it would be an excel match  for he was rich  and she was handsom  mrs  jen had been anxious to see colonel brandon well marri  ever sinc her connect with sir john first brought him to her knowledg  and she was alway anxious to get a good husband for everi pretti girl  the immedi advantag to herself was by no mean inconsider  for it suppli her with endless joke against them both  at the park she laugh at the colonel  and in the cottag at mariann  to the former her railleri was probabl  as far as it regard onli himself  perfect indiffer  but to the latter it was at first incomprehens  and when it object was understood  she hard knew whether most to laugh at it absurd  or censur it impertin  for she consid it as an unfeel reflect on the colonel  s advanc year  and on his forlorn condit as an old bachelor  mrs  dashwood  who could not think a man five year younger than herself  so exceed ancient as he appear to the youth fanci of her daughter  ventur to clear mrs  jen from the probabl of wish to throw ridicul on his age   but at least  mamma  you cannot deni the absurd of the accus  though you may not think it intent ill  natur  colonel brandon is certain younger than mrs  jen  but he is old enough to be my father  and if he were ever anim enough to be in love  must have long outliv everi sensat of the kind  it is too ridicul  when is a man to be safe from such wit  if age and infirm will not protect him   infirm  said elinor   do you call colonel brandon infirm  i can easili suppos that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother  but you can hard deceiv yourself as to his have the use of his limb   did not you hear him complain of the rheumat  and is not that the commonest infirm of declin life   my dearest child  said her mother  laugh   at this rate you must be in continu terror of my decay  and it must seem to you a miracl that my life has been extend to the advanc age of forti   mamma  you are not do me justic  i know veri well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friend yet apprehens of lose him in the cours of natur  he may live twenti year longer  but thirti  five has noth to do with matrimoni   perhap  said elinor   thirti  five and seventeen had better not have ani thing to do with matrimoni togeth  but if there should by ani chanc happen to be a woman who is singl at seven and twenti  i should not think colonel brandon  s be thirti  five ani object to his marri her   a woman of seven and twenti  said mariann  after paus a moment   can never hope to feel or inspir affect again  and if her home be uncomfort  or her fortun small  i can suppos that she might bring herself to submit to the offic of a nurs  for the sake of the provis and secur of a wife  in his marri such a woman therefor there would be noth unsuit  it would be a compact of conveni  and the world would be satisfi  in my eye it would be no marriag at all  but that would be noth  to me it would seem onli a commerci exchang  in which each wish to be benefit at the expens of the other   it would be imposs  i know  repli elinor   to convinc you that a woman of seven and twenti could feel for a man of thirti  five anyth near enough to love  to make him a desir companion to her  but i must object to your doom colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confin of a sick chamber  mere becaus he chanc to complain yesterday  a veri cold damp day  of a slight rheumat feel in one of his shoulder   but he talk of flannel waistcoat  said mariann   and with me a flannel waistcoat is invari connect with ach  cramp  rheumat  and everi speci of ailment that can afflict the old and the feebl   had he been onli in a violent fever  you would not have despis him half so much  confess  mariann  is not there someth interest to you in the flush cheek  hollow eye  and quick puls of a fever  soon after this  upon elinor  s leav the room   mamma  said mariann   i have an alarm on the subject of ill which i cannot conceal from you  i am sure edward ferrar is not well  we have now been here almost a fortnight  and yet he doe not come  noth but real indisposit could occas this extraordinari delay  what els can detain him at norland   had you ani idea of his come so soon  said mrs  dashwood   i had none  on the contrari  if i have felt ani anxieti at all on the subject  it has been in recollect that he sometim show a want of pleasur and readi in accept my invit  when i talk of his come to barton  doe elinor expect him alreadi   i have never mention it to her  but of cours she must   i rather think you are mistaken  for when i was talk to her yesterday of get a new grate for the spare bedchamb  she observ that there was no immedi hurri for it  as it was not like that the room would be want for some time   how strang this is  what can be the mean of it  but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccount  how cold  how compos were their last adieus  how languid their convers the last even of their be togeth  in edward  s farewel there was no distinct between elinor and me  it was the good wish of an affection brother to both  twice did i leav them purpos togeth in the cours of the last morn  and each time did he most unaccount follow me out of the room  and elinor  in quit norland and edward  cri not as i did  even now her self  command is invari  when is she deject or melancholi  when doe

mariann  said elinor  as soon as he had left them   for one morn i think you have done pretti well  you have alreadi ascertain mr  willoughbi  s opinion in almost everi matter of import  you know what he think of cowper and scott  you are certain of his estim their beauti as he ought  and you have receiv everi assur of his admir pope no more than is proper  but how is your acquaint to be long support  under such extraordinari despatch of everi subject for discours  you will soon have exhaust each favourit topic  anoth meet will suffic to explain his sentiment on picturesqu beauti  and second marriag  and then you can have noth farther to ask   elinor  cri mariann   is this fair  is this just  are my idea so scanti  but i see what you mean  i have been too much at my eas  too happi  too frank  i have er against everi common  place notion of decorum  i have been open and sincer where i ought to have been reserv  spiritless  dull  and deceit  had i talk onli of the weather and the road  and had i spoken onli onc in ten minut  this reproach would have been spare   my love  said her mother   you must not be offend with elinor  she was onli in jest  i should scold her myself  if she were capabl of wish to check the delight of your convers with our new friend  mariann was soften in a moment  willoughbi  on his side  gave everi proof of his pleasur in their acquaint  which an evid wish of improv it could offer  he came to them everi day  to enquir after mariann was at first his excus  but the encourag of his recept  to which everi day gave greater kind  made such an excus unnecessari befor it had ceas to be possibl  by mariann  s perfect recoveri  she was confin for some day to the hous  but never had ani confin been less irksom  willoughbi was a young man of good abil  quick imagin  live spirit  and open  affection manner  he was exact form to engag mariann  s heart  for with all this  he join not onli a captiv person  but a natur ardour of mind which was now rous and increas by the exampl of her own  and which recommend him to her affect beyond everi thing els  his societi becam gradual her most exquisit enjoy  they read  they talk  they sang togeth  his music talent were consider  and he read with all the sensibl and spirit which edward had unfortun want  in mrs  dashwood  s estim he was as faultless as in mariann  s  and elinor saw noth to censur in him but a propens  in which he strong resembl and peculiar delight her sister  of say too much what he thought on everi occas  without attent to person or circumst  in hastili form and give his opinion of other peopl  in sacrif general polit to the enjoy of undivid attent where his heart was engag  and in slight too easili the form of world proprieti  he display a want of caution which elinor could not approv  in spite of all that he and mariann could say in it support  mariann began now to perceiv that the desper which had seiz her at sixteen and a half  of ever see a man who could satisfi her idea of perfect  had been rash and unjustifi  willoughbi was all that her fanci had delin in that unhappi hour and in everi brighter period  as capabl of attach her  and his behaviour declar his wish to be in that respect as earnest  as his abil were strong  her mother too  in whose mind not one specul thought of their marriag had been rais  by his prospect of rich  was led befor the end of a week to hope and expect it  and secret to congratul herself on have gain two such son  in  law as edward and willoughbi  colonel brandon  s partial for mariann  which had so earli been discov by his friend  now first becam percept to elinor  when it ceas to be notic by them  their attent and wit were drawn off to his more fortun rival  and the railleri which the other had incur befor ani partial aros  was remov when his feel began realli to call for the ridicul so just annex to sensibl  elinor was oblig  though unwil  to believ that the sentiment which mrs  jen had assign him for her own satisfact  were now actual excit by her sister  and that howev a general resembl of disposit between the parti might forward the affect of mr  willoughbi  an equal strike opposit of charact was no hindranc to the regard of colonel brandon  she saw it with concern  for what could a silent man of five and thirti hope  when oppos to a veri live one of five and twenti  and as she could not even wish him success  she heartili wish him indiffer  she like him  in spite of his graviti and reserv  she beheld in him an object of interest  his manner  though serious  were mild  and his reserv appear rather the result of some oppress of spirit than of ani natur gloomi of temper  sir john had drop hint of past injuri and disappoint  which justifi her belief of his be an unfortun man  and she regard him with respect and compass  perhap she piti and esteem him the more becaus he was slight by willoughbi and mariann  who  prejud against him for be neither live nor young  seem resolv to undervalu his merit   brandon is just the kind of man  said willoughbi one day  when they were talk of him togeth   whom everi bodi speak well of  and nobodi care about  whom all are delight to see  and nobodi rememb to talk to   that is exact what i think of him  cri mariann   do not boast of it  howev  said elinor   for it is injustic in both of you  he is high esteem by all the famili at the park  and i never see him myself without take pain to convers with him   that he is patronis by you  repli willoughbi   is certain in his favour  but as for the esteem of the other  it is a reproach in itself  who would submit to the indign of be approv by such a woman as ladi middleton and mrs  jen  that could command the indiffer of ani bodi els   but perhap the abus of such peopl as yourself and mariann will make amend for the regard of ladi middleton and her mother  if their prais is censur  your censur may be prais  for they are not more undiscern  than you are prejud and unjust   in defenc of your proteg you can even be sauci   my proteg  as you call him  is a sensibl man  and sens will alway have attract for me  yes  mariann  even in a man between thirti and forti  he has seen a great deal of the world  has been abroad  has read  and has a think mind  i have found him capabl of give me much inform on various subject  and he has alway answer my inquiri with readi of good  breed and good natur   that is to say  cri mariann contemptu   he has told you  that in the east indi the climat is hot  and the mosquito are troublesom   he would have told me so  i doubt not  had i made ani such inquiri  but they happen to be point on which i had been previous inform   perhap  said willoughbi   his observ may have extend to the exist of nabob  gold mohr  and palanquin   i may ventur to say that his observ have stretch much further than your candour  but whi should you dislik him   i do not dislik him  i consid him  on the contrari  as a veri respect man  who has everi bodi  s good word  and nobodi  s notic  who  has more money than he can spend  more time than he know how to employ  and two new coat everi year   add to which  cri mariann   that he has neither genius  tast  nor spirit  that his understand has no brillianc  his feel no ardour  and his voic no express   you decid on his imperfect so much in the mass  repli elinor   and so much on the strength of your own imagin  that the commend i am abl to give of him is compar cold and insipid  i can onli pronounc him to be a sensibl man  well  bred  well  inform  of gentl address  and  i believ  possess an amiabl heart   miss dashwood  cri willoughbi   you are now use me unkind  you are endeavour to disarm me by reason  and to convinc me against my will  but it will not do  you shall find me as stubborn as you can be art  i have three unanswer reason for dislik colonel brandon  he threaten me with rain when i want it to be fine  he has found fault with the hang of my curricl  and i cannot persuad him to buy my brown mare  if it will be ani satisfact to you  howev  to be told  that i believ his charact to be in other respect irreproach  i am readi to confess it  and in return for an acknowledg  which must give me some pain  you cannot deni me the privileg of dislik him as much as ever  chapter 11 littl had mrs  dashwood or her daughter imagin when they first came into devonshir  that so mani engag would aris to occupi their time as short present themselv  or that they should have such frequent invit and such constant visitor as to leav them littl leisur for serious employ  yet such was the case  when mariann was recov  the scheme of amus at home and abroad  which sir john had been previous form  were put into execut  the privat ball at the park then began  and parti on the water were made and accomplish as often as a showeri octob would allow  in everi meet of the kind willoughbi was includ  and the eas and familiar which natur attend these parti were exact calcul to give increas intimaci to his acquaint with the dashwood  to afford him opportun of wit the excel of mariann  of mark his anim admir of her  and of receiv  in her behaviour to himself  the most point assur of her affect  elinor could not be surpris at their attach  she onli wish that it were less open shewn  and onc or twice did ventur to suggest the proprieti of some self  command to mariann  but mariann abhor all conceal where no real disgrac could attend unreserv  and to aim at the restraint of sentiment which were not in themselv illaud  appear to her not mere an unnecessari effort  but a disgrac subject of reason to common  place and mistaken notion  willoughbi thought the same  and their behaviour at all time  was an illustr of their opinion  when he was present she had no eye for ani one els  everi thing he did  was right  everi thing he said  was clever  if their even at the park were conclud with card  he cheat himself and all the rest of the parti to get her a good hand  if danc form the amus of the night  they were partner for half the time  and when oblig to separ for a coupl of danc  were care to stand togeth and scarc spoke a word to ani bodi els  such conduct made them of cours most exceed laugh at  but ridicul could not shame  and seem hard to provok them  mrs  dashwood enter into all their feel with a warmth which left her no inclin for check this excess display of them  to her it was but the natur consequ of a strong affect in a young and ardent mind  this was the season of happi to mariann  her heart was devot to willoughbi  and the fond attach to norland  which she brought with her from sussex  was more like to be soften than she had thought it possibl befor  by the charm which his societi bestow on her present home  elinor  s happi was not so great  her heart was not so much at eas  nor her satisfact in their amus so pure  they afford her no companion that could make amend for what she had left behind  nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever  neither ladi middleton nor mrs  jen could suppli to her the convers she miss  although the latter was an everlast talker  and from the first had regard her with a kind which ensur her a larg share of her discours  she had alreadi repeat her own histori to elinor three or four time  and had elinor  s memori been equal to her mean of improv  she might have known veri earli in their acquaint all the particular of mr  jen  s last ill  and what he said to his wife a few minut befor he die  ladi middleton was more agreeabl than her mother onli in be more silent  elinor need littl observ to perceiv that her reserv was a mere calm of manner with which sens had noth to do  toward her husband and mother she was the same as to them  and intimaci was therefor neither to be look for nor desir  she had noth to say one day that she had not said the day befor  her insipid was invari  for even her spirit were alway the same  and though she did not oppos the parti arrang by her husband  provid everi thing were conduct in style and her two eldest children attend her  she never appear to receiv more enjoy from them than she might have experienc in sit at home  and so littl did her presenc add to the pleasur of the other  by ani share in their convers  that they were sometim onli remind of her be amongst them by her solicitud about her troublesom boy  in colonel brandon alon  of all her new acquaint  did elinor find a person who could in ani degre claim the respect of abil  excit the interest of friendship  or give pleasur as a companion  willoughbi was out of the question  her admir and regard  even her sister regard  was all his own  but he was a lover  his attent were wholli mariann  s  and a far less agreeabl man might have been more general pleas  colonel brandon  unfortun for himself  had no such encourag to think onli of mariann  and in convers with elinor he found the greatest consol for the indiffer of her sister  elinor  s compass for him increas  as she had reason to suspect that the miseri of disappoint love had alreadi been known to him  this suspicion was given by some word which accid drop from him one even at the park  when they were sit down togeth by mutual consent  while the other were danc  his eye were fix on mariann  and  after a silenc of some minut  he said  with a faint smile   your sister  i understand  doe not approv of second attach   no  repli elinor   her opinion are all romant   or rather  as i believ  she consid them imposs to exist   i believ she doe  but how she contriv it without reflect on the charact of her own father  who had himself two wive  i know not  a few year howev will settl her opinion on the reason basi of common sens and observ  and then they may be more easi to defin and to justifi than they now are  by ani bodi but herself   this will probabl be the case  he repli   and yet there is someth so amiabl in the prejudic of a young mind  that one is sorri to see them give way to the recept of more general opinion   i cannot agre with you there  said elinor   there are inconveni attend such feel as mariann  s  which all the charm of enthusiasm and ignor of the world cannot aton for  her system have all the unfortun tendenc of set proprieti at nought  and a better acquaint with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possibl advantag  after a short paus he resum the convers by say   doe your sister make no distinct in her object against a second attach  or is it equal crimin in everi bodi  are those who have been disappoint in their first choic  whether from the inconst of it object  or the pervers of circumst  to be equal indiffer dure the rest of their live   upon my word  i am not acquaint with the minutia of her principl  i onli know that i never yet heard her admit ani instanc of a second attach  s be pardon   this  said he   cannot hold  but a chang  a total chang of sentiment  no  no  do not desir it  for when the romant refin of a young mind are oblig to give way  how frequent are they succeed by such opinion as are but too common  and too danger  i speak from experi  i onc knew a ladi who in temper and mind great resembl your sister  who thought and judg like her  but who from an inforc chang  from a seri of unfortun circumst  here he stopt sudden  appear to think that he had said too much  and by his counten gave rise to conjectur  which might not otherwis have enter elinor  s head  the ladi would probabl have pass without suspicion  had he not convinc miss dashwood that what concern her ought not to escap his lip  as it was  it requir but a slight effort of fanci to connect his emot with the tender recollect of past regard  elinor attempt no more  but mariann  in her place  would not have done so littl  the whole stori would have been speedili form under her activ imagin  and everi thing establish in the most melancholi order of disastr love  chapter 12 as elinor and mariann were walk togeth the next morn the latter communic a piec of news to her sister  which in spite of all that she knew befor of mariann  s imprud and want of thought  surpris her by it extravag testimoni of both  mariann told her  with the greatest delight  that willoughbi had given her a hors  one that he had bred himself on his estat in somersetshir  and which was exact calcul to carri a woman  without consid that it was not in her mother  s plan to keep ani hors  that if she were to alter her resolut in favour of this gift  she must buy anoth for the servant  and keep a servant to ride it  and after all  build a stabl to receiv them  she had accept the present without hesit  and told her sister of it in raptur   he intend to send his groom into somersetshir immedi for it  she ad   and when it arriv we will ride everi day  you shall share it use with me  imagin to yourself  my dear elinor  the delight of a gallop on some of these down  most unwil was she to awaken from such a dream of felic to comprehend all the unhappi truth which attend the affair  and for some time she refus to submit to them  as to an addit servant  the expens would be a trifl  mamma she was sure would never object to it  and ani hors would do for him  he might alway get one at the park  as to a stabl  the merest shed would be suffici  elinor then ventur to doubt the proprieti of her receiv such a present from a man so littl  or at least so late known to her  this was too much   you are mistaken  elinor  said she warm   in suppos i know veri littl of willoughbi  i have not known him long inde  but i am much better acquaint with him  than i am with ani other creatur in the world  except yourself and mama  it is not time or opportun that is to determin intimaci  it is disposit alon  seven year would be insuffici to make some peopl acquaint with each other  and seven day are more than enough for other  i should hold myself guilti of greater improprieti in accept a hors from my brother  than from willoughbi  of john i know veri littl  though we have live togeth for year  but of willoughbi my judgment has long been form  elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more  she knew her sister  s temper  opposit on so tender a subject would onli attach her the more to her own opinion  but by an appeal to her affect for her mother  by repres the inconveni which that indulg mother must draw on herself  if  as would probabl be the case  she consent to this increas of establish  mariann was short subdu  and she promis not to tempt her mother to such imprud kind by mention the offer  and to tell willoughbi when she saw him next  that it must be declin  she was faith to her word  and when willoughbi call at the cottag  the same day  elinor heard her express her disappoint to him in a low voic  on be oblig to forego the accept of his present  the reason for this alter were at the same time relat  and they were such as to make further entreati on his side imposs  his concern howev was veri appar  and after express it with earnest  he ad  in the same low voic  but  mariann  the hors is still your  though you cannot use it now  i shall keep it onli till you can claim it  when you leav barton to form your own establish in a more last home  queen mab shall receiv you  this was all overheard by miss dashwood  and in the whole of the sentenc  in his manner of pronounc it  and in his address her sister by her christian name alon  she instant saw an intimaci so decid  a mean so direct  as mark a perfect agreement between them  from that moment she doubt not of their be engag to each other  and the belief of it creat no other surpris than that she  or ani of their friend  should be left by temper so frank  to discov it by accid  margaret relat someth to her the next day  which place this matter in a still clearer light  willoughbi had spent the preced even with them  and margaret  by be left some time in the parlour with onli him and mariann  had had opportun for observ  which  with a most import face  she communic to her eldest sister  when they were next by themselv   oh  elinor  she cri   i have such a secret to tell you about mariann  i am sure she will be marri to mr  willoughbi veri soon   you have said so  repli elinor   almost everi day sinc they first met on high  church down  and they had not known each other a week  i believ  befor you were certain that mariann wore his pictur round her neck  but it turn out to be onli the miniatur of our great uncl   but inde this is quit anoth thing  i am sure they will be marri veri soon  for he has got a lock of her hair   take care  margaret  it may be onli the hair of some great uncl of his   but  inde  elinor  it is mariann  s  i am almost sure it is  for i saw him cut it off  last night after tea  when you and mama went out of the room

to becom a stand joke with mrs  jen  mariann felt for her most sincer  but she did more harm than good to the caus  by turn veri red and say in an angri manner to margaret   rememb that whatev your conjectur may be  you have no right to repeat them   i never had ani conjectur about it  repli margaret   it was you who told me of it yourself  this increas the mirth of the compani  and margaret was eager press to say someth more   oh  pray  miss margaret  let us know all about it  said mrs  jen   what is the gentleman  s name   i must not tell  ma  am  but i know veri well what it is  and i know

fine place about twelv mile from barton  belong to a brother  in  law of colonel brandon  without whose interest it could not be seen  as the proprietor  who was then abroad  had left strict order on

a longer time than i should wish to do  to mariann  he mere bow and said noth   come colonel  said mrs  jen   befor you go  do let us know what you are go about  he wish her a good morn  and  attend by sir john  left the room  the complaint and lament which polit had hitherto restrain  now burst forth univers  and they all agre again and again how provok it was to be so disappoint   i can guess what his busi is  howev  said mrs  jen exult   can you  ma  am  said almost everi bodi   yes  it is about miss william  i am sure   and who is miss william  ask mariann   what  do not you know who miss william is  i am sure you must have heard of her befor  she is a relat of the colonel  s  my dear  a veri near relat  we will not say how near  for fear of shock the young ladi  then  lower her voic a littl  she said to elinor   she is his natur daughter   inde   oh  yes  and as like him as she can stare  i dare say the colonel will leav her all his fortun  when sir john return  he join most heartili in the general regret on so unfortun an event  conclud howev by observ  that as they were all got togeth  they must do someth by way of be happi  and after some consult it was agre  that although happi could onli be enjoy at whitwel  they might procur a toler composur of mind by drive about the countri  the carriag were then order  willoughbi  s was first  and mariann never look happier than when she got into it  he drove through the park veri fast  and they were soon out of sight  and noth more of them was seen till their return  which did not happen till after the return of all the rest  they both seem delight with their drive  but said onli in general term that they had kept in the lane  while the other went on the down  it was settl that there should be a danc in the even  and that everi bodi should be extrem merri all day long  some more of the carey came to dinner  and they had the pleasur of sit down near twenti to tabl  which sir john observ with great content  willoughbi took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwood  mrs  jen sat on elinor  s right hand  and they had not been long seat  befor she leant behind her and willoughbi  and said to mariann  loud enough for them both to hear   i have found you out in spite of all your trick  i know where you spent the morn  mariann colour  and repli veri hastili   where  pray   did not you know  said willoughbi   that we had been out in my curricl   yes  yes  mr  impud  i know that veri well  and i was determin to find out where you had been to  i hope you like your hous  miss mariann  it is a veri larg one  i know  and when i come to see you  i hope you will have new  furnish it  for it want it veri much when i was there six year ago  mariann turn away in great confus  mrs  jen laugh heartili  and elinor found that in her resolut to know where they had been  she had actual made her own woman enquir of mr  willoughbi  s groom  and that she had by that method been inform that they had gone to allenham  and spent a consider time there in walk about the garden and go all over the hous  elinor could hard believ this to be true  as it seem veri unlik that willoughbi should propos  or mariann consent  to enter the hous while mrs  smith was in it  with whom mariann had not the smallest acquaint  as soon as they left the dine  room  elinor enquir of her about it  and great was her surpris when she found that everi circumst relat by mrs  jen was perfect true  mariann was quit angri with her for doubt it   whi should you imagin  elinor  that we did not go there  or that we did not see the hous  is not it what you have often wish to do yourself   yes  mariann  but i would not go while mrs  smith was there  and with no other companion than mr  willoughbi   mr  willoughbi howev is the onli person who can have a right to shew that hous  and as he went in an open carriag  it was imposs to have ani other companion  i never spent a pleasant morn in my life   i am afraid  repli elinor   that the pleasant of an employ doe not alway evinc it proprieti   on the contrari  noth can be a stronger proof of it  elinor  for if there had been ani real improprieti in what i did  i should have been sensibl of it at the time  for we alway know when we are act wrong  and with such a convict i could have had no pleasur   but  my dear mariann  as it has alreadi expos you to some veri impertin remark  do you not now begin to doubt the discret of your own conduct   if the impertin remark of mrs  jen are to be the proof of improprieti in conduct  we are all offend everi moment of our live  i valu not her censur ani more than i should do her commend  i am not sensibl of have done anyth wrong in walk over mrs  smith  s ground  or in see her hous  they will one day be mr  willoughbi  s  and   if they were one day to be your own  mariann  you would not be justifi in what you have done  she blush at this hint  but it was even visibl gratifi to her  and after a ten minut  interv of earnest thought  she came to her sister again  and said with great good humour   perhap  elinor  it was rather ill  judg in me to go to allenham  but mr  willoughbi want particular to shew me the place  and it is a charm hous  i assur you  there is one remark pretti sit room up stair  of a nice comfort size for constant use  and with modern furnitur it would be delight  it is a corner room  and has window on two side  on one side you look across the bowl  green  behind the hous  to a beauti hang wood  and on the other you have a view of the church and villag  and  beyond them  of those fine bold hill that we have so often admir  i did not see it to advantag  for noth could be more forlorn than the furnitur  but if it were newli fit up  a coupl of hundr pound  willoughbi say  would make it one of the pleasantest summer  room in england  could elinor have listen to her without interrupt from the other  she would have describ everi room in the hous with equal delight  chapter 14 the sudden termin of colonel brandon  s visit at the park  with his steadi in conceal it caus  fill the mind  and rais the wonder of mrs  jen for two or three day  she was a great wonder  as everi one must be who take a veri live interest in all the come and go of all their acquaint  she wonder  with littl intermiss what could be the reason of it  was sure there must be some bad news  and thought over everi kind of distress that could have befallen him  with a fix determin that he should not escap them all   someth veri melancholi must be the matter  i am sure  said she   i could see it in his face  poor man  i am afraid his circumst may be bad  the estat at delaford was never reckon more than two thousand a year  and his brother left everyth sad involv  i do think he must have been sent for about money matter  for what els can it be  i wonder whether it is so  i would give anyth to know the truth of it  perhap it is about miss william and  by the bye  i dare say it is  becaus he look so conscious when i mention her  may be she is ill in town  noth in the world more like  for i have a notion she is alway rather sick  i would lay ani wager it is about miss william  it is not so veri like he should be distress in his circumst now  for he is a veri prudent man  and to be sure must have clear the estat by this time  i wonder what it can be  may be his sister is wors at avignon  and has sent for him over  his set off in such a hurri seem veri like it  well  i wish him out of all his troubl with all my heart  and a good wife into the bargain  so wonder  so talk mrs  jen  her opinion vari with everi fresh conjectur  and all seem equal probabl as they aros  elinor  though she felt realli interest in the welfar of colonel brandon  could not bestow all the wonder on his go so sudden away  which mrs  jen was desir of her feel  for besid that the circumst did not in her opinion justifi such last amaz or varieti of specul  her wonder was otherwis dispos of  it was engross by the extraordinari silenc of her sister and willoughbi on the subject  which they must know to be peculiar interest to them all  as this silenc continu  everi day made it appear more strang and more incompat with the disposit of both  whi they should not open acknowledg to her mother and herself  what their constant behaviour to each other declar to have taken place  elinor could not imagin  she could easili conceiv that marriag might not be immedi in their power  for though willoughbi was independ  there was no reason to believ him rich  his estat had been rate by sir john at about six or seven hundr a year  but he live at an expens to which that incom could hard be equal  and he had himself often complain of his poverti  but for this strang kind of secreci maintain by them relat to their engag  which in fact conceal noth at all  she could not account  and it was so wholli contradictori to their general opinion and practic  that a doubt sometim enter her mind of their be realli engag  and this doubt was enough to prevent her make ani inquiri of mariann  noth could be more express of attach to them all  than willoughbi  s behaviour  to mariann it had all the distinguish tender which a lover  s heart could give  and to the rest of the famili it was the affection attent of a son and a brother  the cottag seem to be consid and love by him as his home  mani more of his hour were spent there than at allenham  and if no general engag collect them at the park  the exercis which call him out in the morn was almost certain of end there  where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of mariann  and by his favourit pointer at her feet  one even in particular  about a week after colonel brandon left the countri  his heart seem more than usual open to everi feel of attach to the object around him  and on mrs  dashwood  s happen to mention her design of improv the cottag in the spring  he warm oppos everi alter of a place which affect had establish as perfect with him   what  he exclaim  improv this dear cottag  no  that i will never consent to  not a stone must be ad to it wall  not an inch to it size  if my feel are regard   do not be alarm  said miss dashwood   noth of the kind will be done  for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it   i am heartili glad of it  he cri   may she alway be poor  if she can employ her rich no better   thank you  willoughbi  but you may be assur that i would not sacrific one sentiment of local attach of your  or of ani one whom i love  for all the improv in the world  depend upon it that whatev unemploy sum may remain  when i make up my account in the spring  i would even rather lay it useless by than dispos of it in a manner so pain to you  but are you realli so attach to this place as to see no defect in it   i am  said he   to me it is faultless  nay  more  i consid it as the onli form of build in which happi is attain  and were i rich enough i would instant pull comb down  and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottag   with dark narrow stair and a kitchen that smoke  i suppos  said elinor   yes  cri he in the same eager tone   with all and everi thing belong to it  in no one conveni or inconveni about it  should the least variat be percept  then  and then onli  under such a roof  i might perhap be as happi at comb as i have been at barton   i flatter myself  repli elinor   that even under the disadvantag of better room and a broader staircas  you will hereaft find your own hous as faultless as you now do this   there certain are circumst  said willoughbi   which might great endear it to me  but this place will alway have one claim of my affect  which no other can possibl share  mrs  dashwood look with pleasur at mariann  whose fine eye were fix so express on willoughbi  as plain denot how well she understood him   how often did i wish  ad he   when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth  that barton cottag were inhabit  i never pass within view of it without admir it situat  and griev that no one should live in it  how littl did i then think that the veri first news i should hear from mrs  smith  when i next came into the countri  would be that barton cottag was taken  and i felt an immedi satisfact and interest in the event  which noth but a kind of prescienc of what happi i should experi from it  can account for  must it not have been so  mariann  speak to her in a lower voic  then continu his former tone  he said   and yet this hous you would spoil  mrs  dashwood  you would rob it of it simplic by imaginari improv  and this dear parlour in which our acquaint first began  and in which so mani happi hour have been sinc spent by us togeth  you would degrad to the condit of a common entranc  and everi bodi would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contain within itself more real accommod and comfort than ani other apart of the handsomest dimens in the world could possibl afford  mrs  dashwood again assur him that no alter of the kind should be attempt   you are a good woman  he warm repli   your promis make me easi  extend it a littl farther  and it will make me happi  tell me that not onli your hous will remain the same  but that i shall ever find you and your as unchang as your dwell  and that you will alway consid me with the kind which has made everyth belong to you so dear to me  the promis was readili given  and willoughbi  s behaviour dure the whole of the even declar at onc his affect and happi   shall we see you tomorrow to dinner  said mrs  dashwood  when he was leav them   i do not ask you to come in the morn  for we must walk to the park  to call on ladi middleton  he engag to be with them by four o  clock  chapter 15 mrs  dashwood  s visit to ladi middleton took place the next day  and two of her daughter went with her  but mariann excus herself from be of the parti  under some trifl pretext of employ  and her mother  who conclud that a promis had been made by willoughbi the night befor of call on her while they were absent  was perfect satisfi with her remain at home  on their return from the park they found willoughbi  s curricl and servant in wait at the cottag  and mrs  dashwood was convinc that her conjectur had been just  so far it was all as she had foreseen  but on enter the hous she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect  they were no sooner in the passag than mariann came hastili out of the parlour appar in violent afflict  with her handkerchief at her eye  and without notic them ran up stair  surpris and alarm they proceed direct into the room she had just quit  where they found onli willoughbi  who was lean against the mantel  piec with his back toward them  he turn round on their come in  and his counten shew that he strong partook of the emot which over  power mariann   is anyth the matter with her  cri mrs  dashwood as she enter  is she ill   i hope not  he repli  tri to look cheer  and with a forc smile present ad   it is i who may rather expect to be ill  for i am now suffer under a veri heavi disappoint   disappoint   yes  for i am unabl to keep my engag with you  mrs  smith has this morn exercis the privileg of rich upon a poor depend cousin  by send me on busi to london  i have just receiv my dispatch  and taken my farewel of allenham  and by way of exhilar i am now come to take my farewel of you   to london  and are you go this morn   almost this moment   this is veri unfortun  but mrs  smith must be oblig  and her busi will not detain you from us long i hope  he colour as he repli   you are veri kind  but i have no idea of return into devonshir immedi  my visit to mrs  smith are never repeat within the twelvemonth   and is mrs  smith your onli friend  is allenham the onli hous in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcom  for shame  willoughbi  can you wait for an invit here  his colour increas  and with his eye fix on the ground he onli repli   you are too good  mrs  dashwood look at elinor with surpris  elinor felt equal amaz  for a few moment everi one was silent  mrs  dashwood first spoke   i have onli to add  my dear willoughbi  that at barton cottag you will alway be welcom  for i will not press you to return here immedi  becaus you onli can judg how far that might be pleas to mrs  smith  and on this head i shall be no more dispos to question your judgment than to doubt your inclin   my engag at present  repli willoughbi  confus   are of such a natur  that  i dare not flatter myself  he stopt  mrs  dashwood was too much astonish to speak  and anoth paus succeed  this was broken by willoughbi  who said with a faint smile   it is folli to linger in this manner  i will not torment myself ani longer by remain among friend whose societi it is imposs for me now to enjoy  he then hastili took leav of them all and left the room  they saw him step into his carriag  and in a minut it was out of sight  mrs  dashwood felt too much for speech  and instant quit the parlour to give way in solitud to the concern and alarm which this sudden departur occas  elinor  s uneasi was at least equal to her mother  s  she thought of what had just pass with anxieti and distrust  willoughbi  s behaviour in take leav of them  his embarrass  and affect of cheer  and  abov all  his unwilling to accept her mother  s invit  a backward so unlik a lover  so unlik himself  great disturb her  one moment she fear that no serious design had ever been form on his side  and the next that some unfortun quarrel had taken place between him and her sister  the distress in which mariann had quit the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reason account for  though when she consid what mariann  s love for him was  a quarrel seem almost imposs  but whatev might be the particular of their separ  her sister  s afflict was indubit  and she thought with the tenderest compass of that violent sorrow which mariann was in all probabl not mere give way to as a relief  but feed and encourag as a duti  in about half an hour her mother return  and though her eye were red  her counten was not uncheer   our dear willoughbi is now some mile from barton  elinor  said she  as she sat down to work   and with how heavi a heart doe he travel   it is all veri strang  so sudden to be gone  it seem but the work of a moment  and last night he was with us so happi  so cheer  so affection  and now  after onli ten minut notic  gone too without intend to return  someth more than what be own to us must have happen  he did not speak  he did not behav like himself  you must have seen the differ as well as i  what can it be  can they have quarrel  whi els should he have shewn such unwilling to accept your invit here   it was not inclin that he want  elinor  i could plain see that  he had not the power of accept it  i have thought it all over i assur you  and i can perfect account for everi thing that at first seem strang to me as well as to you   can you  inde   yes  i have explain it to myself in the most satisfactori way  but you  elinor  who love to doubt where you can  it will not satisfi you  i know  but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it  i am persuad that mrs  smith suspect his regard for mariann  disapprov of it   perhap becaus she has other view for him  and on that account is eager to get him away  and that the busi which she send him off to transact is invent as an excus to dismiss him  this is what i believ to have happen  he is  moreov  awar that she doe disapprov the connect  he dare not therefor at present confess to her his engag with mariann  and he feel himself oblig  from his depend situat  to give into her scheme  and absent himself from devonshir for a while  you will tell me  i know  that this may or may not have happen  but i will listen to no cavil  unless you can point out ani other method of understand the affair as satisfactori at this  and now  elinor  what have you to say   noth  for you have anticip my answer   then you would have told me  that it might or might not have happen  oh  elinor  how incomprehens are your feel  you had rather take evil upon credit than good  you had rather look out for miseri for mariann  and guilt for poor willoughbi  than an apolog for the latter  you are resolv to think him blameabl  becaus he took leav of us with less affect than his usual behaviour has shewn  and is no allow to be made for inadvert  or for spirit depress by recent disappoint  are no probabl to be accept  mere becaus they are not certainti  is noth due to the man whom we have all such reason to love  and no reason in the world to think ill of  to the possibl of motiv unanswer in themselv  though unavoid secret for a while  and  after all  what is it you suspect him of   i can hard tell myself  but suspicion of someth unpleas is the inevit consequ of such an alter as we just wit in him  there is great truth  howev  in what you have now urg of the allow which ought to be made for him  and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of everi bodi  willoughbi may undoubt have veri suffici reason for his conduct  and i will hope that he has  but it would have been more like willoughbi to acknowledg them at onc  secreci may be advis  but still i cannot help wonder at it be practic by him   do not blame him  howev  for depart from his charact  where the deviat is necessari  but you realli do admit the justic of what i have said in his defenc  i am happi  and he is acquit   not entir  it may be proper to conceal their engag  if they are engag  from mrs  smith  and if that is the case  it must be high expedi for willoughbi to be but littl in devonshir at present  but this is no excus for their conceal it from us   conceal it from us  my dear child  do you accus willoughbi and mariann of conceal  this is strang inde  when your eye have been reproach them everi day for incauti   i want no proof of their affect  said elinor   but of their engag i do   i am perfect satisfi of both   yet not a syllabl has been said to you on the subject  by either of them   i have not want syllabl where action have spoken so plain  has not his behaviour to mariann and to all of us  for at least the last fortnight  declar that he love and consid her as his futur wife  and that he felt for us the attach of the nearest relat  have we not perfect understood each other  has not my consent been daili ask by his look  his manner  his attent and affection respect  my elinor  is it possibl to doubt their engag  how could such a thought occur to you  how is it to be suppos that willoughbi  persuad as he must be of your sister  s love  should leav her  and leav her perhap for month  without tell her of his affect  that they should part without a mutual exchang of confid   i confess  repli elinor   that everi circumst except one is in favour of their engag  but that one is the total silenc of both on the subject  and with me it almost outweigh everi other   how strang this is  you must think wretch inde of willoughbi  if  after all that has open pass between them  you can doubt the natur of the term on which they are togeth  has he been act a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time  do you suppos him realli indiffer to her   no  i cannot think that  he must and doe love her i am sure   but with a strang kind of tender  if he can leav her with such indiffer  such careless of the futur  as you attribut to him   you must rememb  my dear mother  that i have never consid this matter as certain  i have had my doubt  i confess  but they are fainter than they were  and they may soon be entir done away  if we find they correspond  everi fear of mine will be remov   a mighti concess inde  if you were to see them at the altar  you would suppos they were go to be marri  ungraci girl  but i requir no such proof  noth in my opinion has ever pass to justifi doubt  no secreci has been attempt  all has been uniform open and unreserv  you cannot doubt your sister  s wish  it must be willoughbi therefor whom you suspect  but whi  is he not a man of honour and feel  has there been ani inconsist on his side to creat alarm  can he be deceit   i hope not  i believ not  cri elinor   i love willoughbi  sincer love him  and suspicion of his integr cannot be more pain to yourself than to me  it has been involuntari  and i will not encourag it  i was startl  i confess  by the alter in his manner this morn  he did not speak like himself  and did not return your kind with ani cordial  but all this may be explain by such a situat of his affair as you have suppos  he had just part from my sister  had seen her leav him in the greatest afflict  and if he felt oblig  from a fear of offend mrs  smith  to resist the temptat of return here soon  and yet awar that by declin your invit  by say that he was go away for some time  he should seem to act an ungener  a suspici part by our famili  be might well be embarrass and disturb  in such a case  a plain and open avow of his difficulti would have been more to his honour i think  as well as more consist with his general charact  but i will not rais object against ani one  s conduct on so illiber a foundat  as a differ in judgment from myself  or a deviat from what i may think right and consist   you speak veri proper  willoughbi certain doe not deserv to be suspect  though we have not known him long  he is no stranger in this part of the world  and who has ever spoken to his disadvantag  had he been in a situat to act independ and marri immedi  it might have been odd that he should leav us without acknowledg everyth to me at onc  but this is not the case  it is an engag in some respect not prosper begun  for their marriag must be at a veri uncertain distanc  and even secreci  as far as it can be observ  may now be veri advis  they were interrupt by the entranc of margaret  and elinor was then at liberti to think over the represent of her mother  to acknowledg the probabl of mani  and hope for the justic of all  they saw noth of mariann till dinner time  when she enter the room and took her place at the tabl without say a word  her eye were red and swollen  and it seem as if her tear were even then restrain with difficulti  she avoid the look of them all  could neither eat nor speak  and after some time  on her mother  s silent press her hand with tender compass  her small degre of fortitud was quit overcom  she burst into tear and left the room  this violent oppress of spirit continu the whole even  she was without ani power  becaus she was without ani desir of command over herself  the slightest mention of anyth relat to willoughbi overpow her in an instant  and though her famili were most anxious attent to her comfort  it was imposs for them  if they spoke at all  to keep clear of everi subject which her feel connect with him  chapter 16 mariann would have thought herself veri inexcus had she been abl to sleep at all the first night after part from willoughbi  she would have been asham to look her famili in the face the next morn  had she not risen from her bed in more need of repos than when she lay down in it  but the feel which made such composur a disgrac  left her in no danger of incur it  she was awak the whole night  and she wept the greatest part of it  she got up with a headach  was unabl to talk  and unwil to take ani nourish  give pain everi moment to her mother and sister  and forbid all attempt at consol from either  her sensibl was potent enough  when breakfast was over she walk out by herself  and wander about the villag of allenham  indulg the recollect of past enjoy and cri over the present revers for the chief of the morn  the even pass off in the equal indulg of feel  she play over

such violenc of afflict inde could not be support for ever  it sunk within a few day into a calmer melancholi  but these employ  to which she daili recur  her solitari walk and silent medit  still produc occasion effus of sorrow as live as ever  no letter from willoughbi came  and none seem expect by mariann  her mother was surpris  and elinor again becam uneasi  but mrs  dashwood could find explan whenev she want them  which at least satisfi herself   rememb  elinor  said she   how veri often sir john fetch our letter himself from the post  and carri them to it  we have alreadi agre that secreci may be necessari  and we must acknowledg that it could not be maintain if their correspond were to pass through sir john  s hand  elinor could not deni the truth of this  and she tri to find in it a motiv suffici for their silenc  but there was one method so direct  so simpl  and in her opinion so elig of know the real state of the affair  and of instant remov all mysteri  that she could not help suggest it to her mother   whi do you not ask mariann at onc  said she   whether she is or she is not engag to willoughbi  from you  her mother  and so kind  so indulg a mother  the question could not give offenc  it would be the natur result of your affect for her  she use to be all unreserv  and to you more especi   i would not ask such a question for the world  suppos it possibl that

and rug  and distant object out of sight  which ought onli to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazi atmospher  you must be satisfi with such admir as i can honest give  i call it a veri fine countri  the hill are steep  the wood seem full of fine timber  and the valley look comfort and snug  with rich meadow and sever neat farm hous scatter here and there  it exact answer my idea of a fine countri  becaus it unit beauti with util  and i dare say it is a picturesqu one too  becaus you admir it  i can easili believ it to be full of rock and promontori  grey moss and brush wood  but these are all lost on me  i know noth of the picturesqu   i am afraid it is but too true  said mariann   but whi should you boast of it   i suspect  said elinor   that to avoid one kind of affect  edward here fall into anoth  becaus he believ mani peopl pretend to more admir of the beauti of natur than they realli feel  and is disgust with such pretens  he affect greater indiffer and less

pretend to feel and tri to describ with the tast and eleg of him who first defin what picturesqu beauti was  i detest jargon of everi kind  and sometim i have kept my feel to myself  becaus i could find no languag to describ them in but what was worn and hackney out of all sens and mean   i am convinc  said edward   that you realli feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to

him   i do not doubt it  repli he  rather astonish at her earnest and warmth  for had he not imagin it to be a joke for the good of her acquaint in general  found onli on a someth or a noth between mr  willoughbi and herself  he would not have ventur to mention it  chapter 19 edward remain a week at the cottag  he was earnest press by mrs  dashwood to stay longer  but  as if he were bent onli on self  mortif  he seem resolv to be gone when his enjoy among his friend was at the height  his spirit  dure the last two or three day  though still veri unequ  were great improv  he grew more and more partial to the hous and environ  never spoke of go away without a sigh  declar his time to be wholli disengag  even doubt to what place he should go when he left them  but still  go he must  never had ani week pass so quick  he could hard believ it to be gone  he said so repeat  other thing he said too  which mark the turn of his feel and gave the lie to his action  he had no pleasur at norland  he detest be in town  but either to norland or london  he must go  he valu their kind beyond ani thing  and his greatest happi was in be with them  yet  he must leav them at the end of a week  in spite of their wish and his own  and without ani restraint on his time  elinor place all that was astonish in this way of act to his mother  s account  and it was happi for her that he had a mother whose charact was so imperfect known to her  as to be the general excus for everi thing strang on the part of her son  disappoint  howev  and vex as she was  and sometim displeas with his uncertain behaviour to herself  she was veri well dispos on the whole to regard his action with all the candid allow and generous qualif  which had been rather more pain extort from her  for willoughbi  s servic  by her mother  his want of spirit  of open  and of consist  were most usual attribut to his want of independ  and his better knowledg of mrs  ferrar  s disposit and design  the short of his

from such vain wish she was forc to turn for comfort to the renew of her confid in edward  s affect  to the remembr of everi mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at barton  and abov all to that flatter proof of it which he constant wore round his finger   i think  edward  said mrs  dashwood  as they were at breakfast the last morn   you would be a happier man if you had ani profess to engag your time and give an interest to your plan and action  some inconveni to your friend  inde  might result from it  you would not be abl to give them so much of your time  but  with a

has been  and is  and probabl will alway be a heavi misfortun to me  that i have had no necessari busi to engag me  no profess to give me employ  or afford me ani thing like independ  but unfortun my

i was too old when the subject was first start to enter it  and  at length  as there was no necess for my have ani profess at all  as i might be as dash and expens without a red coat on my back as

took place  and left an uncomfort impress on elinor  s feel especi  which requir some troubl and time to subdu  but as it was her determin to subdu it  and to prevent herself from appear to suffer more than what all her famili suffer on his go away  she did not adopt the method so judici employ by mariann  on a similar occas  to augment and fix her sorrow  by seek silenc  solitud and idl  their

her own had seem faulti to her  the busi of self  command she settl veri easili  with strong affect it was imposs  with calm one it could have no merit  that her sister  s affect were calm  she dare not deni  though she blush to acknowledg it  and of the strength of her own  she gave a veri strike proof  by still love and respect that sister  in spite of this mortifi convict  without shut herself

might be abl to give some more particular account of willoughbi  s general charact  than could be gather from the middleton  partial acquaint with him  and she was eager to gain from ani one  such a confirm of his merit as might remov the possibl of fear from mariann  she began by inquir if they saw much of mr  willoughbi at cleveland  and whether they were intim acquaint with him   oh dear  yes  i know him extrem well  repli mrs  palmer  not that i ever spoke to him  inde  but i have seen him for ever in town  somehow or other i never happen to be stay at barton while he was at allenham  mama

though it did not give actual eleg or grace  gave distinct to her person  their manner were particular civil  and elinor soon allow them credit for some kind of sens  when she saw with what constant and judici attent they were make themselv agreeabl to ladi middleton  with her children they were in continu raptur  extol their beauti  court their notic  and humour their whim  and such of their

most rapaci of human be  is likewis the most credul  her demand are exorbit  but she will swallow ani thing  and the excess affect and endur of the miss steel toward her offspr were view therefor by ladi middleton without the smallest surpris or distrust  she saw with matern complac all the impertin encroach and mischiev trick to which her cousin submit  she saw their sash unti  their hair pull about their ear  their work  bag search  and their knive and scissor stolen away  and felt no doubt of it be a reciproc enjoy  it suggest no other surpris than that elinor and mariann should sit so compos by  without claim a share in what was pass   john is in such spirit today  said she  on his take miss steel  s pocket handkerchief  and throw it out of window  he is full of monkey trick  and soon afterward  on the second boy  s violent pinch one of the same ladi  s finger  she fond observ   how play william is   and here is my sweet littl annamaria  she ad  tender caress a littl girl of three year old  who had not made a nois for the last two minut   and she is alway so gentl and quiet  never was there such a quiet littl thing  but unfortun in bestow these embrac  a pin in her ladyship  s head dress slight scratch the child  s neck  produc from this pattern of gentl such violent scream  as could hard be outdon by ani creatur profess noisi  the mother  s constern was excess  but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steel  and everi thing was done by all three  in so critic an emerg  which affect could suggest as like to assuag the agoni of the littl suffer  she was seat in her mother  s lap  cover with kiss  her wound bath with lavend  water  by one of the miss steel  who was on her knee to attend her  and her mouth stuf with sugar plum by the other  with such a reward for her tear  the child was too wise to ceas cri  she still scream and sob lustili  kick her two brother for offer to touch her  and all their unit sooth were ineffectu till ladi middleton luckili rememb that in a scene of similar distress last week  some apricot marmalad had been success appli for a bruis templ  the same remedi was eager propos for this unfortun scratch  and a slight intermiss of scream in the young ladi on hear it  gave them reason to hope that it would not be reject  she was carri out of the room therefor in her mother  s arm  in quest of this medicin  and as the two boy chose to follow  though earnest entreat by their mother to stay behind  the four young ladi were left in a quiet which the room had not known for mani hour   poor littl creatur  said miss steel  as soon as they were gone   it might have been a veri sad accid   yet i hard know how  cri mariann   unless it had been under total differ circumst  but this is the usual way of heighten alarm  where there is noth to be alarm at in realiti   what a sweet woman ladi middleton is  said luci steel  mariann was silent  it was imposs for her to say what she did not feel  howev trivial the occas  and upon elinor therefor the whole task of tell lie when polit requir it  alway fell  she did her best when thus call on  by speak of ladi middleton with more warmth than she felt  though with far less than miss luci   and sir john too  cri the elder sister   what a charm man he is  here too  miss dashwood  s commend  be onli simpl and just  came in without ani eclat  she mere observ that he was perfect good humour and friend   and what a charm littl famili they have  i never saw such fine children in my life  i declar i quit doat upon them alreadi  and inde i am alway distract fond of children   i should guess so  said elinor  with a smile   from what i have wit this morn   i have a notion  said luci   you think the littl middleton rather too much indulg  perhap they may be the outsid of enough  but it is so natur in ladi middleton  and for my part  i love to see children full of life and spirit  i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet   i confess  repli elinor   that while i am at barton park  i never think of tame and quiet children with ani abhorr  a short paus succeed this speech  which was first broken by miss steel  who seem veri much dispos for convers  and who now said rather abrupt   and how do you like devonshir  miss dashwood  i suppos you were veri sorri to leav sussex  in some surpris at the familiar of this question  or at least of the manner in which it was spoken  elinor repli that she was   norland is a prodigi beauti place  is not it  ad miss steel   we have heard sir john admir it excess  said luci  who seem to think some apolog necessari for the freedom of her sister   i think everi one must admir it  repli elinor   who ever saw the place  though it is not to be suppos that ani one can estim it beauti as we do   and had you a great mani smart beaux there  i suppos you have not so mani in this part of the world  for my part  i think they are a vast addit alway   but whi should you think  said luci  look asham of her sister   that there are not as mani genteel young men in devonshir as sussex   nay  my dear  i  m sure i don  t pretend to say that there an  t  i  m sure there  s a vast mani smart beaux in exet  but you know  how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland  and i was onli afraid the miss dashwood might find it dull at barton  if they had not so mani as they use to have  but perhap you young ladi may not care about the beaux  and had as lief be without them as with them  for my part  i think they are vast agreeabl  provid they dress smart and behav civil  but i can  t bear to see them dirti and nasti  now there  s mr  rose at exet  a prodigi smart young man  quit a beau  clerk to mr  simpson  you know  and yet if you do but meet him of a morn  he is not fit to be seen  i suppos your brother was quit a beau  miss dashwood  befor he marri  as he was so rich   upon my word  repli elinor   i cannot tell you  for i do not perfect comprehend the mean of the word  but this i can say  that if he ever was a beau befor he marri  he is one still for there is not the smallest alter in him   oh  dear  one never think of marri men  s be beaux  they have someth els to do   lord  ann  cri her sister   you can talk of noth but beaux  you will make miss dashwood believ you think of noth els  and then to turn the discours  she began admir the hous and the furnitur  this specimen of the miss steel was enough  the vulgar freedom and folli of the eldest left her no recommend  and as elinor was not blind by the beauti  or the shrewd look of the youngest  to her want of real eleg and artless  she left the hous without ani wish of know them better  not so the miss steel  they came from exet  well provid with admir for the use of sir john middleton  his famili  and all his relat  and no niggard proport was now dealt out to his fair cousin  whom they declar to be the most beauti  eleg  accomplish  and agreeabl girl they had ever beheld  and with whom they were particular anxious to be better acquaint  and to be better acquaint therefor  elinor soon found was their inevit lot  for as sir john was entir on the side of the miss steel  their parti would be too strong for opposit  and that kind of intimaci must be submit to  which consist of sit an hour or two togeth in the same room almost everi day  sir john could do no more  but he did not know that ani more was requir  to be togeth was  in his opinion  to be intim  and while his continu scheme for their meet were effectu  he had not a doubt of their be establish friend  to do him justic  he did everi thing in his power to promot their unreserv  by make the miss steel acquaint with whatev he knew or suppos of his cousin  situat in the most delic particular  and elinor had not seen them more than twice  befor the eldest of them wish her joy on her sister  s have been so lucki as to make a conquest of a veri smart beau sinc she came to barton   twill be a fine thing to have her marri so young to be sure  said she   and i hear he is quit a beau  and prodigi handsom  and i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon  but perhap you may have a friend in the corner alreadi  elinor could not suppos that sir john would be more nice in proclaim his suspicion of her regard for edward  than he had been with respect to mariann  inde it was rather his favourit joke of the two  as be somewhat newer and more conjectur  and sinc edward  s visit  they had never dine togeth without his drink to her best affect with so much signific and so mani nod and wink  as to excit general attent  the letter f  had been likewis invari brought forward  and found product of such countless joke  that it charact as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long establish with elinor  the miss steel  as she expect  had now all the benefit of these joke  and in the eldest of them they rais a curios to know the name of the gentleman allud to  which  though often impertin express  was perfect of a piec with her general inquisit into the concern of their famili  but sir john did not sport long with the curios which he delight to rais  for he had at least as much pleasur in tell the name  as miss steel had in hear it   his name is ferrar  said he  in a veri audibl whisper   but pray do not tell it  for it  s a great secret   ferrar  repeat miss steel   mr  ferrar is the happi man  is he  what  your sister  in  law  s brother  miss dashwood  a veri agreeabl young man to be sure  i know him veri well   how can you say so  ann  cri luci  who general made an amend to all her sister  s assert   though we have seen him onc or twice at my uncl  s  it is rather too much to pretend to know him veri well  elinor heard all this with attent and surpris   and who was this uncl  where did he live  how came they acquaint  she wish veri much to have the subject continu  though she did not chuse to join in it herself  but noth more of it was said  and for the first time in her life  she thought mrs  jen defici either in curios after petti inform  or in a disposit to communic it  the manner in which miss steel had spoken of edward  increas her curios  for it struck her as be rather ill  natur  and suggest the suspicion of that ladi  s know  or fanci herself to know someth to his disadvantag  but her curios was unavail  for no farther notic was taken of mr  ferrar  s name by miss steel when allud to  or even open mention by sir john  chapter 22 mariann  who had never much toler for ani thing like impertin  vulgar  inferior of part  or even differ of tast from herself  was at this time particular ill  dispos  from the state of her spirit  to be pleas with the miss steel  or to encourag their advanc  and to the invari cold of her behaviour toward them  which check everi endeavour at intimaci on their side  elinor princip attribut that prefer of herself which soon becam evid in the manner of both  but especi of luci  who miss no opportun of engag her in convers  or of strive to improv their acquaint by an easi and frank communic of her sentiment  luci was natur clever  her remark were often just and amus  and as a companion for half an hour elinor frequent found her agreeabl  but her power had receiv no aid from educ  she was ignor and illiter  and her defici of all mental improv  her want of inform in the most common particular  could not be conceal from miss dashwood  in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantag  elinor saw  and piti her for  the neglect of abil which educ might have render so respect  but she saw  with less tender of feel  the thorough want of delicaci  of rectitud  and integr of mind  which her attent  her assidu  her flatteri at the park betray  and she could have no last satisfact in the compani of a person who join insincer with ignor  whose want of instruct prevent their meet in convers on term of equal  and whose conduct toward other made everi shew of attent and defer toward herself perfect valueless   you will think my question an odd one  i dare say  said luci to her one day  as they were walk togeth from the park to the cottag  but pray  are you person acquaint with your sister  in  law  s mother  mrs  ferrar  elinor did think the question a veri odd one  and her counten express it  as she answer that she had never seen mrs  ferrar   inde  repli luci   i wonder at that  for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometim  then  perhap  you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is   no  return elinor  cautious of give her real opinion of edward  s mother  and not veri desir of satisfi what seem impertin curios   i know noth of her   i am sure you think me veri strang  for enquir about her in such a way  said luci  eye elinor attent as she spoke   but perhap there may be reason  i wish i might ventur  but howev i hope you will do me the justic of believ that i do not mean to be impertin  elinor made her a civil repli  and they walk on for a few minut in silenc  it was broken by luci  who renew the subject again by say  with some hesit   i cannot bear to have you think me impertin curious  i am sure i would rather do ani thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth have as your  and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trust you  inde  i should be veri glad of your advic how to manag in such and uncomfort situat as i am  but  howev  there is no occas to troubl you  i am sorri you do not happen to know mrs  ferrar   i am sorri i do not  said elinor  in great astonish   if it could be of ani use to you to know my opinion of her  but realli i never understood that you were at all connect with that famili  and therefor i am a littl surpris  i confess  at so serious an inquiri into her charact   i dare say you are  and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it  but if i dare tell you all  you would not be so much surpris  mrs  ferrar is certain noth to me at present  but the time may come  how soon it will come must depend upon herself  when we may be veri intim connect  she look down as she said this  amiabl bash  with onli one side glanc at her companion to observ it effect on her   good heaven  cri elinor   what do you mean  are you acquaint with mr  robert ferrar  can you be  and she did not feel much delight with the idea of such a sister  in  law   no  repli luci   not to mr  robert ferrar  i never saw him in my life  but  fix her eye upon elinor   to his eldest brother  what felt elinor at that moment  astonish  that would have been as pain as it was strong  had not an immedi disbelief of the assert attend it  she turn toward luci in silent amaz  unabl to divin the reason or object of such a declar  and though her complexion vari  she stood firm in incredul  and felt in no danger of an hyster fit  or a swoon   you may well be surpris  continu luci   for to be sure you could have had no idea of it befor  for i dare say he never drop the smallest hint of it to you or ani of your famili  becaus it was alway meant to be a great secret  and i am sure has been faith kept so by me to this hour  not a soul of all my relat know of it but ann  and i never should have mention it to you  if i had not felt the greatest depend in the world upon your secreci  and i realli thought my behaviour in ask so mani question about mrs  ferrar must seem so odd  that it ought to be explain  and i do not think mr  ferrar can be displeas  when he know i have trust you  becaus i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your famili  and look upon yourself and the other miss dashwood quit as his own sister  she paus  elinor for a few moment remain silent  her astonish at what she heard was at first too great for word  but at length forc herself to speak  and to speak cautious  she said  with calm of manner  which toler well conceal her surpris and solicitud   may i ask if your engag is of long stand   we have been engag these four year   four year   yes  elinor  though great shock  still felt unabl to believ it   i did not know  said she   that you were even acquaint till the other day   our acquaint  howev  is of mani year date  he was under my uncl  s care  you know  a consider while   your uncl   yes  mr  pratt  did you never hear him talk of mr  pratt   i think i have  repli elinor  with an exert of spirit  which increas with her increas of emot   he was four year with my uncl  who live at longstapl  near plymouth  it was there our acquaint begun  for my sister and me was often stay with my uncl  and it was there our engag was form  though not till a year after he had quit as a pupil  but he was almost alway with us afterward  i was veri unwil to enter into it  as you may imagin  without the knowledg and approb of his mother  but i was too young  and love him too well  to be so prudent as i ought to have been  though you do not know him so well as me  miss dashwood  you must have seen enough of him to be sensibl he is veri capabl of make a woman sincer attach to him   certain  answer elinor  without know what she said  but after a moment  s reflect  she ad  with reviv secur of edward  s honour and love  and her companion  s falsehood  engag to mr  edward ferrar  i confess myself so total surpris at what you tell me  that realli  i beg your pardon  but sure there must be some mistak of person or name  we cannot mean the same mr  ferrar   we can mean no other  cri luci  smile   mr  edward ferrar  the eldest son of mrs  ferrar  of park street  and brother of your sister  in  law  mrs  john dashwood  is the person i mean  you must allow that i am not like to be deceiv as to the name of the man on who all my happi depend   it is strang  repli elinor  in a most pain perplex   that i should never have heard him even mention your name   no  consid our situat  it was not strang  our first care has been to keep the matter secret  you knew noth of me  or my famili  and  therefor  there could be no occas for ever mention my name to you  and  as he was alway particular afraid of his sister  s suspect ani thing  that was reason enough for his not mention it  she was silent  elinor  s secur sunk  but her self  command did not sink with it   four year you have been engag  said she with a firm voic   yes  and heaven know how much longer we may have to wait  poor edward  it put him quit out of heart  then take a small miniatur from her pocket  she ad   to prevent the possibl of mistak  be so good as to look at this face  it doe not do him justic  to be sure  but yet i think you cannot be deceiv as to the person it was drew for  i have had it abov these three year  she put it into her hand as she spoke  and when elinor saw the paint  whatev other doubt her fear of a too hasti decis  or her wish of detect falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind  she could have none of it be edward  s face  she return it almost instant  acknowledg the like   i have never been abl  continu luci   to give him my pictur in return  which i am veri much vex at  for he has been alway so anxious to get it  but i am determin to set for it the veri first opportun   you are quit in the right  repli elinor calm  they then proceed a few pace in silenc  luci spoke first   i am sure  said she   i have no doubt in the world of your faith keep this secret  becaus you must know of what import it is to us  not to have it reach his mother  for she would never approv of it  i dare say  i shall have no fortun  and i fanci she is an exceed proud woman   i certain did not seek your confid  said elinor   but you do me no more than justic in imagin that i may be depend on  your secret is safe with me  but pardon me if i express some surpris at so unnecessari a communic  you must at least have felt that my be acquaint with it could not add to it safeti  as she said this  she look earnest at luci  hope to discov someth in her counten  perhap the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been say  but luci  s counten suffer no chang   i was afraid you would think i was take a great liberti with you  said she   in tell you all this  i have not known you long to be sure  person at least  but i have known you and all your famili by descript a great while  and as soon as i saw you  i felt almost as if you was an old acquaint  besid in the present case  i realli thought some explan was due to you after my make such particular inquiri about edward  s mother  and i am so unfortun  that i have not a creatur whose advic i can ask  ann is the onli person that know of it  and she has no judgment at all  inde  she doe me a great deal more harm than good  for i am in constant fear of her betray me  she doe not know how to hold her tongu  as you must perceiv  and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world t  other day  when edward  s name was mention by sir john  lest she should out with it all  you can  t think how much i go through in my mind from it altogeth  i onli wonder that i am aliv after what i have suffer for edward  s sake these last four year  everi thing in such suspens and uncertainti  and see him so seldom  we can hard meet abov twice a  year  i am sure i wonder my heart is not quit broke  here she took out her handkerchief  but elinor did not feel veri compassion   sometim  continu luci  after wipe her eye   i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entir  as she said this  she look direct at her companion   but then at other time i have not resolut enough for it  i cannot bear the thought of make him so miser  as i know the veri mention of such a thing would do  and on my own account too  so dear as he is to me  i don  t think i could be equal to it  what would you advis me to do in such a case  miss dashwood  what would you do yourself   pardon me  repli elinor  startl by the question   but i can give you no advic under such circumst  your own judgment must direct you   to be sure  continu luci  after a few minut silenc on both side   his mother must provid for him sometim or other  but poor edward is so cast down by it  did you not think him dread low  spirit when he was at barton  he was so miser when he left us at longstapl  to go to you  that i was afraid you would think him quit ill   did he come from your uncl  s  then  when he visit us   oh  yes  he had been stay a fortnight with us  did you think he came direct from town   no  repli elinor  most feel sensibl of everi fresh circumst in favour of luci  s verac   i rememb he told us  that he had been stay a fortnight with some friend near plymouth  she rememb too  her own surpris at the time  at his mention noth farther of those friend  at his total silenc with respect even to their name   did not you think him sad out of spirit  repeat luci   we did  inde  particular so when he first arriv   i beg him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter  but it made him so melancholi  not be abl to stay more than a fortnight with us  and see me so much affect  poor fellow  i am afraid it is just the same with him now  for he write in wretch spirit  i heard from him just befor i left exet  take a letter from her pocket and careless show the direct to elinor   you know his hand  i dare say  a charm one it is  but that is not written so well as usual  he was tire  i dare say  for he had just fill the sheet to me as full as possibl  elinor saw that it was his hand  and she could doubt no longer  this pictur  she had allow herself to believ  might have been accident obtain  it might not have been edward  s gift  but a correspond between them by letter  could subsist onli under a posit engag  could be authoris by noth els  for a few moment  she was almost overcom  her heart sunk within her  and she could hard stand  but exert was indispens necessari  and she struggl so resolut against the oppress of her feel  that her success was speedi  and for the time complet   write to each other  said luci  return the letter into her pocket   is the onli comfort we have in such long separ  yes  i have one other comfort in his pictur  but poor edward has not even that  if he had but my pictur  he say he should be easi  i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstapl last  and that was some comfort to him  he said  but not equal to a pictur  perhap you might notic the ring when you saw him   i did  said elinor  with a composur of voic  under which was conceal an emot and distress beyond ani thing she had ever felt befor  she was mortifi  shock  confound  fortun for her  they had now reach the cottag  and the convers could be continu no farther  after sit with them a few minut  the miss steel return to the park  and elinor was then at liberti to think and be wretch   at this point in the first and second edit  volum 1 end  chapter 23 howev small elinor  s general depend on luci  s verac might be  it was imposs for her on serious reflect to suspect it in the present case  where no temptat could be answer to the folli of invent a falsehood of such a descript  what luci had assert to be true  therefor  elinor could not  dare not longer doubt  support as it was too on everi side by such probabl and proof  and contradict by noth but her own wish  their opportun of acquaint in the hous of mr  pratt was a foundat for the rest  at onc indisput and alarm  and edward  s visit near plymouth  his melancholi state of mind

such behaviour  her indign at have been it dupe  for a short time made her feel onli for herself  but other idea  other consider  soon aros  had edward been intent deceiv her  had he feign a regard for her which he did not feel  was his engag to luci an engag of the heart  no  whatev it might onc have been  she could not believ it such at present  his affect was all her own  she could not be deceiv in that  her mother  sister  fanni  all had been conscious of his regard for her at norland  it was not an illus of her own vaniti  he certain love her  what a soften of the heart was this persuas  how much could it not tempt her to forgiv  he had been blamabl  high blamabl  in remain at norland after he first felt her influenc over him to be more than it ought to be  in that  he could not be defend  but if he had injur her  how much more had he injur himself  if her case were pitiabl  his was hopeless  his imprud had made her miser for a while  but it seem to have depriv himself of all chanc of ever be otherwis  she might in time regain tranquil  but he  what had he to look forward to  could he ever be toler happi with luci steel  could he  were his affect for herself out of the question  with his integr  his delicaci  and well  inform mind  be satisfi with a wife like her  illiter  art  and selfish  the youth infatu of nineteen would natur blind him to everi thing but her beauti and good natur  but the four succeed year  year  which if ration spent  give such improv to the understand  must have open his eye to her defect of educ  while the same period of time  spent on her side in inferior societi and more frivol pursuit  had perhap rob her of that simplic which might onc have given an interest charact to her beauti  if in the supposit of his seek to marri herself  his difficulti from his mother had seem great  how much greater were they now like to be  when the object of his engag was undoubt inferior in connect  and probabl inferior in fortun to herself  these difficulti  inde  with a heart so alien from luci  might not press veri hard upon his patienc  but melancholi was the state of the person by whom the expect of famili opposit and unkind  could be felt as a relief  as these consider occur to her in pain success  she wept for him  more than for herself  support by the convict of have done noth to merit her present unhappi  and consol by the belief that edward had done noth to forfeit her esteem  she thought she could even now  under the first smart of the heavi blow  command herself enough to guard everi suspicion of the truth from her mother and sister  and so well was she abl to answer her own expect  that when she join them at dinner onli two hour after she had first suffer the extinct of all her dearest hope  no one would have suppos from the appear of the sister  that elinor was mourn in secret over obstacl which must divid her for ever from the object of her love  and that mariann was intern dwell on the perfect of a man  of

to herself  though it oblig her to unceas exert  was no aggrav of elinor  s distress  on the contrari it was a relief to her  to be spare the communic of what would give such afflict to them  and to be save likewis from hear that condemn of edward  which would probabl flow from the excess of their partial affect for herself  and which was more than she felt equal to support  from their counsel  or their convers  she knew she could receiv no assist  their tender and sorrow must add to her distress  while her self  command would neither receiv encourag from their exampl nor from their prais  she was stronger alon  and her own good sens so well support her  that her firm was as unshaken  her appear of cheer as invari  as with regret so poignant and so fresh  it was possibl for them to be  much as she had suffer from her first convers with luci on the subject  she soon felt an earnest wish of renew it  and this for more reason than one  she want to hear mani particular of their engag repeat again  she want more clear to understand what luci realli felt for edward  whether there were ani sincer in her declar of tender regard for him  and she particular want to convinc luci  by her readi to enter on the matter again  and her calm in convers on it  that she was no otherwis interest in it than as a friend  which she veri much fear her involuntari agit  in their morn discours  must have left at least doubt  that luci was dispos to be jealous of her appear veri probabl  it was plain that edward had alway spoken high in her prais  not mere from luci  s assert  but from her ventur to trust her on so short a person acquaint  with a secret so confess and evid import  and even sir john  s joke intellig must have had some weight  but inde  while elinor remain so well assur within herself of be realli belov by edward  it requir no other consider of probabl to make it natur that luci should be jealous  and that she was so  her veri confid was a proof  what other reason for the disclosur of the affair could there be  but that elinor might be inform by it of luci  s superior claim on edward  and be taught to avoid him in futur  she had littl difficulti in understand thus much of her rival  s intent  and while she was firm resolv to act by her as everi principl of honour and honesti direct  to combat her own affect for edward and to see him as littl as possibl  she could not deni herself the comfort of endeavour to convinc luci that her heart was unwound  and as she could now have noth more pain to hear on the subject than had alreadi been told  she did not mistrust her own abil of go through a repetit of particular with composur  but it was not immedi that an opportun of do so could be command  though luci was as well dispos as herself to take advantag of ani that occur  for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their join in a walk  where they might most easili separ themselv from the other  and though they met at least everi other even either at the park or cottag  and chiefli at the former  they could not be suppos to meet for the sake of convers  such a thought would never enter either sir john or ladi middleton  s head  and therefor veri littl leisur was ever given for a general chat  and none at all for particular discours  they met for the sake of eat  drink  and laugh togeth  play at card  or consequ  or ani other game that was suffici noisi  one or two meet of this kind had taken place  without afford elinor ani chanc of engag luci in privat  when sir john call at the cottag one morn  to beg  in the name of chariti  that they would all dine with ladi middleton that day  as he was oblig to attend the club at exet  and she would otherwis be quit alon  except her mother and the two miss steel  elinor  who foresaw a fairer open for the point she had in view  in such a parti as this was like to be  more at liberti among themselv under the tranquil and well  bred direct of ladi middleton than when her husband unit them togeth in one noisi purpos  immedi accept the invit  margaret  with her mother  s permiss  was equal compliant  and mariann  though alway unwil to join ani of their parti  was persuad by her mother  who could not bear to have her seclud herself from ani chanc of amus  to go likewis  the young ladi went  and ladi middleton was happili preserv from the fright solitud which had threaten her  the insipid of the meet was exact such as elinor had expect  it produc not one novelti of thought or express  and noth could be less interest than the whole of their discours both in the dine parlour and draw room  to the latter  the children accompani them  and while they remain there  she was too well convinc of the imposs of engag luci  s attent to attempt it  they quit it onli with the remov of the tea  thing  the card  tabl was then place  and elinor began to wonder at herself for have ever entertain a hope of find time for convers at the park  they all rose up in prepar for a round game   i am glad  said ladi middleton to luci   you are not go to finish poor littl annamaria  s basket this even  for i am sure it must hurt your eye to work filigre by candlelight  and we will make the dear littl love some amend for her disappoint to  morrow  and then i hope she will not much mind it  this hint was enough  luci recollect herself instant and repli   inde you are veri much mistaken  ladi middleton  i am onli wait to know whether you can make your parti without me  or i should have been at my filigre alreadi  i would not disappoint the littl angel for all the world  and if you want me at the card  tabl now  i am resolv to finish the basket after supper   you are veri good  i hope it won  t hurt your eye  will you ring the bell for some work candl  my poor littl girl would be sad disappoint  i know  if the basket was not finish tomorrow  for though i told her it certain would not  i am sure she depend upon have it done  luci direct drew her work tabl near her and reseat herself with an alacr and cheer which seem to infer that she could tast no greater delight than in make a filigre basket for a spoilt child  ladi middleton propos a rubber of casino to the other  no one made ani object but mariann  who with her usual inattent to the form of general civil  exclaim   your ladyship will have the good to excus me  you know i detest card  i shall go to the piano  fort  i have not touch it sinc it was tune  and without farther ceremoni  she turn away and walk to the instrument  ladi middleton look as if she thank heaven that she had never made so rude a speech   mariann can never keep long from that instrument you know  ma  am  said elinor  endeavour to smooth away the offenc   and i do not much wonder at it  for it is the veri best tone piano  fort i ever heard  the remain five were now to draw their card   perhap  continu elinor   if i should happen to cut out  i may be of some use to miss luci steel  in roll her paper for her  and there is so much still to be done to the basket  that it must be imposs i think for her labour singl  to finish it this even  i should like the work exceed  if she would allow me a share in it   inde i shall be veri much oblig to you for your help  cri luci   for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was  and it would be a shock thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all   oh  that would be terribl  inde  said miss steel   dear littl soul  how i do love her   you are veri kind  said ladi middleton to elinor   and as you realli like the work  perhap you will be as well pleas not to cut in till anoth rubber  or will you take your chanc now  elinor joy profit by the first of these propos  and thus by a littl of that address which mariann could never condescend to practis  gain her own end  and pleas ladi middleton at the same time  luci made room for her with readi attent  and the two fair rival were thus seat side by side at the same tabl  and  with the utmost harmoni  engag in forward the same work  the pianofort at which mariann  wrap up in her own music and her own thought  had by this time forgotten that ani bodi was in the room besid herself  was luckili so near them that miss dashwood now judg she might safe  under the shelter of it nois  introduc the interest subject  without ani risk of be heard at the card  tabl  chapter 24 in a firm  though cautious tone  elinor thus began   i should be undeserv of the confid you have honour me with  if i felt no desir for it continu  or no farther curios on it subject  i will not apolog therefor for bring it forward again   thank you  cri luci warm   for break the ice  you have set my heart at eas by it  for i was somehow or other afraid i had offend you by what i told you that monday   offend me  how could you suppos so  believ me  and elinor spoke it with the truest sincer   noth could be farther from my intent than to give you such an idea  could you have a motiv for the trust  that was not honour and flatter to me   and yet i do assur you  repli luci  her littl sharp eye full of mean   there seem to me to be a cold and displeasur in your manner that made me quit uncomfort  i felt sure that you was angri with me  and have been quarrel with myself ever sinc  for have took such a liberti as to troubl you with my affair  but i am veri glad to find it was onli my own fanci  and that you realli do not blame me  if you knew what a consol it was to me to reliev my heart speak to you of what i am alway think of everi moment of my life  your compass would make you overlook everi thing els i am sure   inde  i can easili believ that it was a veri great relief to you  to acknowledg your situat to me  and be assur that you shall never have reason to repent it  your case is a veri unfortun one  you seem to me to be surround with difficulti  and you will have need of all your mutual affect to support you under them  mr  ferrar  i believ  is entir depend on his mother   he has onli two thousand pound of his own  it would be mad to marri upon that  though for my own part  i could give up everi prospect of more without a sigh  i have been alway use to a veri small incom  and could struggl with ani poverti for him  but i love him too well to be the selfish mean of rob him  perhap  of all that his mother might give him if he marri to pleas her  we must wait  it may be for mani year  with almost everi other man in the world  it would be an alarm prospect  but edward  s affect and constanc noth can depriv me of i know   that convict must be everi thing to you  and he is undoubt support by the same trust in your  s  if the strength of your reciproc attach had fail  as between mani peopl  and under mani circumst it natur would dure a four year  engag  your situat would have been pitiabl  inde  luci here look up  but elinor was care in guard her counten from everi express that could give her word a suspici tendenc   edward  s love for me  said luci   has been pretti well put to the test  by our long  veri long absenc sinc we were first engag  and it has stood the trial so well  that i should be unpardon to doubt it now  i can safe say that he has never gave me one moment  s alarm on that account from the first  elinor hard knew whether to smile or sigh at this assert  luci went on   i am rather of a jealous temper too by natur  and from our differ situat in life  from his be so much more in the world than me  and our continu separ  i was enough inclin for suspicion  to have found out the truth in an instant  if there had been the slightest alter in his behaviour to me when we met  or ani low of spirit that i could not account for  or if he had talk more of one ladi than anoth  or seem in ani respect less happi at longstapl than he use to be  i do not mean to say that i am particular observ or quick  sight in general  but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceiv   all this  thought elinor   is veri pretti  but it can impos upon neither of us   but what  said she after a short silenc   are your view  or have you none but that of wait for mrs  ferrar  s death  which is a melancholi and shock extrem  is her son determin to submit to this  and to all the tedious of the mani year of suspens in which it may involv you  rather than run the risk of her displeasur for a while by own the truth   if we could be certain that it would be onli for a while  but mrs  ferrar is a veri headstrong proud woman  and in her first fit of anger upon hear it  would veri like secur everi thing to robert  and the idea of that  for edward  s sake  frighten away all my inclin for hasti measur   and for your own sake too  or you are carri your disinterested beyond reason  luci look at elinor again  and was silent   do you know mr  robert ferrar  ask elinor   not at all  i never saw him  but i fanci he is veri unlik his brother  silli and a great coxcomb   a great coxcomb  repeat miss steel  whose ear had caught those word by a sudden paus in mariann  s music   oh  they are talk of their favourit beaux  i dare say   no sister  cri luci   you are mistaken there  our favourit beaux are not great coxcomb   i can answer for it that miss dashwood  s is not  said mrs  jen  laugh heartili   for he is one of the modestest  prettiest behav young men i ever saw  but as for luci  she is such a sli littl creatur  there is no find out who she like   oh  cri miss steel  look signific round at them   i dare say luci  s beau is quit as modest and pretti behav as miss dashwood  s  elinor blush in spite of herself  luci bit her lip  and look angrili at her sister  a mutual silenc took place for some time  luci first put an end to it by say in a lower tone  though mariann was then give them the power protect of a veri magnific concerto   i will honest tell you of one scheme which has late come into my head  for bring matter to bear  inde i am bound to let you into the secret  for you are a parti concern  i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to everi other profess  now my plan is that he should take order as soon as he can  and then through your interest  which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him  and i hope out of some regard to me  your brother might be persuad to give him norland live  which i understand is a veri good one  and the present incumb not like to live a great while  that would be enough for us to marri upon  and we might trust to time and chanc for the rest   i should alway be happi  repli elinor   to show ani mark of my esteem and friendship for mr  ferrar  but do you not perceiv that my interest on such an occas would be perfect unnecessari  he is brother to mrs  john dashwood  that must be recommend enough to her husband   but mrs  john dashwood would not much approv of edward  s go into order   then i rather suspect that my interest would do veri littl  they were again silent for mani minut  at length luci exclaim with a deep sigh   i believ it would be the wisest way to put an end to the busi at onc by dissolv the engag  we seem so beset with difficulti on everi side  that though it would make us miser for a time  we should be happier perhap in the end  but you will not give me your advic  miss dashwood   no  answer elinor  with a smile  which conceal veri agit feel   on such a subject i certain will not  you know veri well that my opinion would have no weight with you  unless it were on the side of your wish   inde you wrong me  repli luci  with great solemn   i know nobodi of whose judgment i think so high as i do of your  and i do realli believ  that if you was to say to me   i advis you by all mean to put an end to your engag with edward ferrar  it will be more for the happi of both of you  i should resolv upon do it immedi  elinor blush for the insincer of edward  s futur wife  and repli   this compliment would effectu frighten me from give ani opinion on the subject had i form one  it rais my influenc much too high  the power of divid two peopl so tender attach is too much for an indiffer person   tis becaus you are an indiffer person  said luci  with some piqu  and lay a particular stress on those word   that your judgment might just have such weight with me  if you could be suppos to be bias in ani respect by your own feel  your opinion would not be worth have  elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this  lest they might provok each other to an unsuit increas of eas and unreserv  and was even part determin never to mention the subject again  anoth paus therefor of mani minut  durat  succeed this speech  and luci was still the first to end it   shall you be in town this winter  miss dashwood  said she with all her accustomari complac   certain not   i am sorri for that  return the other  while her eye brighten at the inform   it would have gave me such pleasur to meet you there  but i dare say you will go for all that  to be sure  your brother and sister will ask you to come to them   it will not be in my power to accept their invit if they do   how unlucki that is  i had quit depend upon meet you there  ann and me are to go the latter end of januari to some relat who have been want us to visit them these sever year  but i onli go for the sake of see edward  he will be there in februari  otherwis london would have no charm for me  i have not spirit for it  elinor was soon call to the card  tabl by the conclus of the first rubber  and the confidenti discours of the two ladi was therefor at an end  to which both of them submit without ani reluct  for noth had been said on either side to make them dislik each other less than they had done befor  and elinor sat down to the card tabl with the melancholi persuas that edward was not onli without affect for the person who was to be his wife  but that he had not even the chanc of be toler happi in marriag  which sincer affect on her side would have given  for self  interest alon could induc a woman to keep a man to an engag  of which she seem so thorough awar that he was weari  from this time the subject was never reviv by elinor  and when enter on by luci  who seldom miss an opportun of introduc it  and was particular care to inform her confidant  of her happi whenev she receiv a letter from edward  it was treat by the former with calm and caution  and dismiss as soon as civil would allow  for she felt such convers to be an indulg which luci did not deserv  and which were danger to herself  the visit of the miss steel at barton park was lengthen far beyond what the first invit impli  their favour increas  they could not be spare  sir john would not hear of their go  and in spite of their numer and long arrang engag in exet  in spite of the absolut necess of return to fulfil them immedi  which was in full forc at the end of everi week  they were prevail on to stay near two month at the park  and to assist in the due celebr of that festiv which requir a more than ordinari share of privat ball and larg dinner to proclaim it import  chapter 25 though mrs  jen was in the habit of spend a larg portion of the year at the hous of her children and friend  she was not without a settl habit of her own  sinc the death of her husband  who had trade with success in a less eleg part of the town  she had resid everi winter in a hous in one of the street near portman squar  toward this home  she began on the approach of januari to turn her thought  and thither she one day abrupt  and veri unexpect by them  ask the elder miss dashwood to accompani her  elinor  without observ the vari complexion of her sister  and the anim look which spoke no indiffer to the plan  immedi gave a grate but absolut denial for both  in which she believ herself to be speak their unit inclin  the reason alleg was their determin resolut of not leav their mother at that time of the year  mrs  jen receiv the refus with some surpris  and repeat her invit immedi   oh  lord  i am sure your mother can spare you veri well  and i do beg you will favour me with your compani  for i  ve quit set my heart upon it  don  t fanci that you will be ani inconveni to me  for i shan  t put myself at all out of my way for you  it will onli be send betti by the coach  and i hope i can afford that  we three shall be abl to go veri well in my chais  and when we are in town  if you do not like to go wherev i do  well and good  you may alway go with one of my daughter  i am sure your mother will not object to it  for i have had such good luck in get my own children off my hand that she will think me a veri fit person to have the charg of you  and if i don  t get one of you at least well marri befor i have done with you  it shall not be my fault  i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men  you may depend upon it   i have a notion  said sir john   that miss mariann would not object to such a scheme  if her elder sister would come into it  it is veri hard inde that she should not have a littl pleasur  becaus miss dashwood doe not wish it  so i would advis you two  to set off for town  when you are tire of barton  without say a word to miss dashwood about it   nay  cri mrs  jen   i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss mariann  s compani  whether miss dashwood will go or not  onli the more the merrier say i  and i thought it would be more comfort for them to be togeth  becaus  if they got tire of me  they might talk to one anoth  and laugh at my old way behind my back  but one or the other  if not both of them  i must have  lord bless me  how do you think i can live poke by myself  i who have been alway use till this winter to have charlott with me  come  miss mariann  let us strike hand upon the bargain  and if miss dashwood will chang her mind by and bye  whi so much the better   i thank you  ma  am  sincer thank you  said mariann  with warmth   your invit has insur my gratitud for ever  and it would give me such happi  yes  almost the greatest happi i am capabl of  to be abl to accept it  but my mother  my dearest  kindest mother  i feel the justic of what elinor has urg  and if she were to be made less happi  less comfort by our absenc  oh  no  noth should tempt me to leav her  it should not  must not be a struggl  mrs  jen repeat her assur that mrs  dashwood could spare them perfect well  and elinor  who now understood her sister  and saw to what indiffer to almost everi thing els she was carri by her eager to be with willoughbi again  made no farther direct opposit to the plan  and mere refer it to her mother  s decis  from whom howev she scarc expect to receiv ani support in her endeavour to prevent a visit  which she could not approv of for mariann  and which on her own account she had particular reason to avoid  whatev mariann was desir of  her mother would be eager to promot  she could not expect to influenc the latter to cautious of conduct in an affair respect which she had never been abl to inspir her with distrust  and she dare not explain the motiv of her own disinclin for go to london  that mariann  fastidi as she was  thorough acquaint with mrs  jen  manner  and invari disgust by them  should overlook everi inconveni of that kind  should disregard whatev must be most wound to her irrit feel  in her pursuit of one object  was such a proof  so strong  so full  of the import of that object to her  as elinor  in spite of all that had pass  was not prepar to wit  on be inform of the invit  mrs  dashwood  persuad that such an excurs would be product of much amus to both her daughter  and perceiv through all her affection attent to herself  how much the heart of mariann was in it  would not hear of their declin the offer upon her account  insist on their both accept it direct  and then began to forese  with her usual cheer  a varieti of advantag that would accru to them all  from this separ   i am delight with the plan  she cri   it is exact what i could wish  margaret and i shall be as much benefit by it as yourselv  when you and the middleton are gone  we shall go on so quiet and happili togeth with our book and our music  you will find margaret so improv when you come back again  i have a littl plan of alter for your bedroom too  which may now be perform without ani inconveni to ani one  it is veri right that you should go to town  i would have everi young woman of your condit in life acquaint with the manner and amus of london  you will be under the care of a mother good sort of woman  of whose kind to you i can have no doubt  and in all probabl you will see your brother  and whatev may be his fault  or the fault of his wife  when i consid whose son he is  i cannot bear to have you so wholli estrang from each other   though with your usual anxieti for our happi  said elinor   you have been obviat everi impedi to the present scheme which occur to you  there is still one object which  in my opinion  cannot be so easili remov  mariann  s counten sunk   and what  said mrs  dashwood   is my dear prudent elinor go to suggest  what formid obstacl is she now to bring forward  do let me hear a word about the expens of it   my object is this  though i think veri well of mrs  jen  s heart  she is not a woman whose societi can afford us pleasur  or whose protect will give us consequ   that is veri true  repli her mother   but of her societi  separ from that of other peopl  you will scarc have ani thing at all  and you will almost alway appear in public with ladi middleton   if elinor is frighten away by her dislik of mrs  jen  said mariann   at least it need not prevent my accept her invit  i have no such scrupl  and i am sure i could put up with everi unpleas of that kind with veri littl effort  elinor could not help smile at this display of indiffer toward the manner of a person  to whom she had often had difficulti in persuad mariann to behav with toler polit  and resolv within herself  that if her sister persist in go  she would go likewis  as she did not think it proper that mariann should be left to the sole guidanc of her own judgment  or that mrs  jen should be abandon to the merci of mariann for all the comfort of her domest hour  to this determin she was the more easili reconcil  by recollect that edward ferrar  by luci  s account  was not to be in town befor februari  and that their visit  without ani unreason abridg  might be previous finish   i will have you both go  said mrs  dashwood   these object are nonsens  you will have much pleasur in be in london  and especi in be togeth  and if elinor would ever condescend to anticip enjoy  she would forese it there from a varieti of sourc  she would  perhap  expect some from improv her acquaint with her sister  in  law  s famili  elinor had often wish for an opportun of attempt to weaken her mother  s depend on the attach of edward and herself  that the shock might be less when the whole truth were reveal  and now on this attack  though almost hopeless of success  she forc herself to begin her design by say  as calm as she could   i like edward ferrar veri much  and shall alway be glad to see him  but as to the rest of the famili  it is a matter of perfect indiffer to me  whether i am ever known to them or not  mrs  dashwood smile  and said noth  mariann lift up her eye in astonish  and elinor conjectur that she might as well have held her tongu  after veri littl farther discours  it was final settl that the invit should be fulli accept  mrs  jen receiv the inform with a great deal of joy  and mani assur of kind and care  nor was it a matter of pleasur mere to her  sir john was delight  for to a man  whose prevail anxieti was the dread of be alon  the acquisit of two  to the number of inhabit in london  was someth  even ladi middleton took the troubl of be delight  which was put herself rather out of her way  and as for the miss steel  especi luci  they had never been so happi in their live as this intellig made them  elinor submit to the arrang which counteract her wish with less reluct than she had expect to feel  with regard to herself  it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not  and when she saw her mother so thorough pleas with the plan  and her sister exhilar by it in look  voic  and manner  restor to all her usual anim  and elev to more than her usual gaieti  she could not be dissatisfi with the caus  and would hard allow herself to distrust the consequ  mariann  s joy was almost a degre beyond happi  so great was the perturb of her spirit and her impati to be gone  her unwilling to quit her mother was her onli restor to calm  and at the moment of part her grief on that score was excess  her mother  s afflict was hard less  and elinor was the onli one of the three  who seem to consid the separ as ani thing short of etern  their departur took place in the first week in januari  the middleton were to follow in about a week  the miss steel kept their station at the park  and were to quit it onli with the rest of the famili  chapter 26 elinor could not find herself in the carriag with mrs  jen  and begin a journey to london under her protect  and as her guest  without wonder at her own

had all  with that happi ardour of youth which mariann and her mother equal share  been overcom or overlook  and elinor  in spite of everi occasion doubt of willoughbi  s constanc  could not wit the raptur of delight expect which fill the whole soul and beam in the eye of mariann  without feel how blank was her own prospect  how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison  and how glad she would engag in the solicitud of mariann  s situat to have the same anim object in view  the same possibl of hope  a short  a veri short time howev must now decid what willoughbi  s intent were  in all

of what futur complais and companion to mrs  jen might be expect to be  she sat in silenc almost all the way  wrapt in her own medit  and scarc ever voluntarili speak  except when ani object of

seem to do her ani good  i am sure if i knew of ani thing she would like  i would send all over the town for it  well  it is the oddest thing to me  that a man should use such a pretti girl so ill  but when there is plenti of money on one side  and next to none on the other  lord bless you  they care no more about such thing   the ladi then  miss grey i think you call her  is veri rich   fifti thousand pound  my dear  did you ever see her  a smart  stylish girl they say  but not handsom  i rememb her aunt veri well  biddi henshaw  she marri a veri wealthi man  but the famili are all rich togeth  fifti thousand pound  and by all account  it won  t come befor it  s want  for they say he is all to piec  no wonder  dash about with his curricl and hunter  well  it don  t signifi talk  but when a young man  be who he will  come and make love to a pretti girl  and promis marriag  he has no busi to fli off from his word onli becaus he grow poor  and a richer girl is readi to have him  whi don  t he  in such a case  sell his hors  let his hous  turn off his servant  and make a thorough reform at onc  i warrant you  miss mariann would have been readi to wait till matter came round  but that won  t do now  a  day  noth in the way of pleasur can ever be given up by the young men of this age   do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is  is she said to be amiabl   i never heard ani harm of her  inde i hard ever heard her mention  except that mrs  taylor did say this morn  that one day miss walker hint to her  that she believ mr  and mrs  ellison would not be sorri to have miss grey marri  for she and mrs  ellison could never agre   and who are the ellison   her guardian  my dear  but now she is of age and may choos for herself  and a pretti choic she has made  what now  after paus a moment  your poor sister is gone to her own room  i suppos  to moan by herself  is there noth one can get to comfort her  poor dear  it seem quit cruel to let her be alon  well  by  and

mariann  i dare say  will not leav her room again this even  i shall persuad her if i can to go earli to bed  for i am sure she want rest   aye  i believ that will be best for her  let her name her own supper  and go to bed  lord  no wonder she has been look so bad and so cast down this last week or two  for this matter i suppos has been hang over her head as long as that  and so the letter that came today finish it  poor soul  i am sure if i had had a notion of it  i would not have joke her about it for all my money  but then you know  how should i guess such a thing  i made sure of it be noth but a common love letter  and you know young peopl like to be laugh at about them  lord  how concern sir john and my daughter will be when they hear it  if i had my sens about me i might have call in conduit street in my way home  and told them of it  but i shall see them tomorrow   it would be unnecessari i am sure  for you to caution mrs  palmer and sir john against ever name mr

been suspect of a much nearer connect with her  it is now three year ago  she had just reach her fourteenth year  that i remov her from school  to place her under the care of a veri respect woman  resid in dorsetshir  who had the charg of four or five other girl of about the same time of life  and for two year i had everi reason to be pleas with her situat  but last februari  almost a

the first news that reach me of her  he continu   came in a letter from herself  last octob  it was forward to me from delaford  and i receiv it on the veri morn of our intend parti to whitwel  and this was the reason of my leav barton so sudden  which i am sure must at the time have appear strang to everi bodi  and which i believ gave offenc to some  littl did mr  willoughbi imagin  i suppos  when his look censur me for incivil in break up the parti  that i was call away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miser  but had he known it  what would it have avail  would he have been less gay or less happi in the smile of your sister  no  he had alreadi done that  which no man who can feel for anoth would do  he had left the girl whose youth and innoc he had seduc  in a situat of

 and pictur her to herself  with an affect for him so strong  still as strong as her own  and with a mind torment by self  reproach  which must attend her through life  sure this comparison must have it use with her  she will feel her own suffer to be noth  they proceed from no misconduct  and can bring no disgrac  on the contrari  everi friend must be made still more her friend by them  concern for her unhappi  and respect for her fortitud under it  must strengthen everi attach  use your own discret  howev  in communic to her what i have told you  you must know best what will be it effect  but had i not serious  and from my heart believ it might be of servic  might lessen her regret  i would not have suffer myself to troubl you with this account of my famili afflict  with a recit which

former had hope to see  not that mariann appear to distrust the truth of ani part of it  for she listen to it all with the most steadi and submiss attent  made neither object nor remark  attempt no

violent irrit than befor  she did not see her less wretch  her mind did becom settl  but it was settl in a gloomi deject  she felt the loss of willoughbi  s charact yet more heavili than she had felt the loss of his heart  his seduct and desert of miss william  the miseri of that poor girl  and the doubt of what his design might onc have been on herself  prey altogeth so much on her spirit  that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to elinor  and  brood over her sorrow in silenc  gave more pain to her sister than could have been communic by the most open and most frequent confess of them  to give the feel or the languag of mrs  dashwood on receiv and answer elinor  s letter would be onli to give a repetit of what her daughter had alreadi felt and said  of a

had alway seen him there  she recommend it to her daughter  therefor  by all mean not to shorten their visit to mrs  jen  the length of which  though never exact fix  had been expect by all to compris at least five or six week  a varieti of occup  of object  and of compani  which could not be procur at barton  would be inevit there  and might yet  she hope  cheat mariann  at time  into some

at first as a probabl event  had brought herself to expect as a certain one  she had yet anoth reason for wish her children to remain where they were  a letter from her son  in  law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town befor the middl of februari  and she judg it right that they should sometim see their brother  mariann had promis to be guid by her mother  s opinion  and she submit

was a matter of great consol to her  that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister  and elinor  on the other hand  suspect that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entir

think that  instead of midsumm  they would not be marri till michaelma  and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all  the good understand between the colonel and miss dashwood seem rather to declar that the honour of the mulberri  tree  the canal  and the yew arbour  would all be made over to her  and mrs  jen had  for some time ceas to think at all of mrs  ferrar  earli in

to see you well settl  fanni particular  for she has your interest veri much at heart  i assur you  and her mother too  mrs  ferrar  a veri good  natur woman  i am sure it would give her great pleasur  she said as much the other day  elinor would not vouchsaf ani answer   it would be someth remark  now  he continu   someth droll  if fanni should have a brother and i a sister settl at the same time  and yet it is not veri unlik   is mr  edward ferrar  said elinor  with resolut   go to be marri   it is not actual settl  but there is such a thing in agit  he has a most excel mother  mrs  ferrar  with the utmost liber  will come forward  and settl on him a thousand a year  if the match take place  the ladi is the hon  miss morton  onli daughter of the late lord morton  with thirti thousand pound  a veri desir connect on both side  and i have not a doubt of it take place in time  a thousand a  year is a great deal for a mother to give away  to make over for ever  but mrs  ferrar has a nobl spirit  to give you anoth instanc of her liber  the other day  as soon as we came to town  awar that money could not be veri plenti with us just now  she put bank  note into fanni  s hand to the

countri must certain be consider  but your incom is a larg one   not so larg  i dare say  as mani peopl suppos  i do not mean to complain  howev  it is undoubt a comfort one  and i hope will in time be better  the enclosur of norland common  now carri on  is a most serious drain  and then i have made a littl purchas within this half year  east kingham farm  you must rememb the place  where old gibson use to live  the land was so veri desir for me in everi respect  so immedi adjoin my own properti  that i felt it my duti to buy it  i could not have answer it to my conscienc to let it fall into ani other hand  a man must pay for his conveni  and it has cost me a vast deal of money   more than you think it realli and intrins worth   whi  i hope not that  i might have sold it again  the next day  for more than i gave  but  with regard to the purchas  money  i might have been veri unfortun inde  for the stock were at that time so low  that if i had not happen to have the necessari sum in my banker  s hand  i must have sold out to veri great loss  elinor could onli smile   other great and inevit expens too we have had on first come to norland  our respect father  as you well know  bequeath all the stanhil effect that remain at norland  and veri valuabl they were  to your mother  far be it from me to repin at his do so  he had an undoubt right to dispos of his own properti as he

from be rich  and how accept mrs  ferrar  s kind is   certain  said elinor   and assist by her liber  i hope you may yet live to be in easi circumst   anoth year or two may do much toward it  he grave repli   but howev there is still a great deal to be done  there is not a stone laid of fanni  s green  hous  and noth but the plan of the flower  garden mark out   where is the green  hous to be   upon the knoll behind the hous  the old walnut tree are all come down to make room for it  it will be a veri fine object from mani part of the park  and the flower  garden will slope down just befor it  and be exceed pretti  we have clear away all the old thorn that grew in patch over the brow  elinor kept her concern and her censur to herself  and was veri thank that mariann was not present  to share the provoc  have now said enough to make his poverti clear  and to do away the necess of buy a pair of ear  ring for each of his sister  in his next visit at gray  s his thought took a cheerful turn  and he began to congratul elinor on have such a friend as mrs  jen   she seem a most valuabl woman inde  her hous  her style of live  all bespeak an exceed good incom  and it is an acquaint that has not onli been of great use to you hitherto  but in the end may prove materi advantag  her invit you to town is certain a vast thing in your favour  and inde  it speak altogeth so great a regard for you  that in all probabl when she die you will not be forgotten  she must have a great deal to leav   noth at all  i should rather suppos  for she has onli her jointur  which will descend to her children   but it is not to be imagin that she live up to her incom  few peopl of common prudenc will do that  and whatev she save  she will be abl to dispos of   and do you not think it more like that she should leav it to her daughter  than to us   her daughter are both exceed well marri  and therefor i cannot perceiv the necess of her rememb them farther  wherea  in my opinion  by her take so much notic of you  and treat you in this kind of way  she has given you a sort of claim on her futur consider  which a conscienti woman would not disregard  noth can be kinder than her behaviour  and she can hard do all this  without be awar of the expect it rais   but she rais none in those most concern  inde  brother  your anxieti for our welfar and prosper carri you too far   whi  to be sure  said he  seem to recollect himself   peopl have littl  have veri littl in their power  but  my dear elinor  what is the matter with mariann  she look veri unwel  has lost her colour  and is grown quit thin  is she ill   she is not well  she has had a nervous complaint on her for sever week   i am sorri for that  at her time of life  ani thing of an ill destroy the bloom for ever  her  s has been a veri short one  she was as handsom a girl last septemb  as i ever saw  and as like to attract the man  there was someth in her style of beauti  to pleas them particular  i rememb fanni use to say that she would marri sooner and better than you did  not but what she is exceed fond of you  but so it happen to strike her  she will be mistaken  howev  i question whether mariann now  will marri a man worth more than five or six hundr a  year  at the utmost  and i am veri much deceiv if you do not do better  dorsetshir  i know veri littl of dorsetshir  but  my dear elinor  i shall be exceed glad to know more of it  and i think i can answer for your have fanni and myself among the earliest and best pleas of your visitor  elinor tri veri serious to convinc him that there was no likelihood of her marri colonel brandon  but it was an expect of too much pleasur to himself to be relinquish  and he was realli resolv on seek an intimaci with that gentleman  and promot the marriag by everi possibl attent  he had just compunct enough for have done noth for his sister himself  to be exceed anxious that everybodi els should do a great deal  and an offer from colonel brandon  or a legaci from mrs  jen  was the easiest mean of aton for his own neglect  they were lucki enough to find ladi middleton at home  and sir john came in befor their visit end  abund of civil pass on all side  sir john was readi to like anybodi  and though mr  dashwood did not seem to know much about hors  he soon set him down as a veri good  natur fellow  while ladi middleton saw enough of fashion in his appear to think his acquaint worth have  and mr  dashwood went away delight with both   i shall have a charm account to carri to fanni  said he  as he walk back with his sister   ladi middleton is realli a most eleg woman  such a woman as i am sure fanni will be glad to know  and mrs  jen too  an exceed well  behav woman  though not so eleg as her daughter  your sister need not have ani scrupl even of visit her  which  to say the truth  has been a littl the case  and veri natur  for we onli knew that mrs  jen was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way  and fanni and mrs  ferrar were both strong prepossess  that neither she nor her daughter were such kind of women as fanni would like to associ with  but now i can carri her a most satisfactori account of both  chapter 34 mrs  john dashwood had so much confid in her husband  s judgment  that she wait the veri next day both on mrs  jen and her daughter  and her confid was reward by find even the former  even the woman with whom her sister were stay  by no mean unworthi her notic  and as for ladi middleton  she found her one of the most charm women in the world  ladi middleton was equal pleas with mrs  dashwood  there was a kind of cold heart selfish on both side  which mutual attract them  and they sympathis with each other in an insipid proprieti of demeanor  and a general want of understand  the same manner  howev  which recommend mrs  john dashwood to the good opinion of ladi middleton did not suit the fanci of mrs  jen  and to her she appear noth more than a littl proud  look woman of uncordi address  who met her husband  s sister without ani affect  and almost without have anyth to say to them  for of the quarter of an hour bestow on berkeley street  she sat at least seven minut and a half in silenc  elinor want veri much to know  though she did not chuse to ask  whether edward was then in town  but noth would have induc fanni voluntarili to mention his name befor her  till abl to tell her that his marriag with miss morton was resolv on  or till her husband  s expect on colonel brandon were answer  becaus she believ them still so veri much attach to each other  that they could not be too sedul divid in word and deed on everi occas  the intellig howev  which she would not give  soon flow from anoth quarter  luci came veri short to claim elinor  s compass on be unabl to see edward  though he had arriv in town with mr  and mrs  dashwood  he dare not come to bartlett  s build for fear of detect  and though their mutual impati to meet  was not to be told  they could do noth at present but write  edward assur them himself of his be in town  within a veri short time  by twice call in berkeley street  twice was his card found on the tabl  when they return from their morn  s engag  elinor was pleas that he had call  and still more pleas that she had miss him  the dashwood were so prodigi delight with the middleton  that  though not much in the habit of give anyth  they determin to give them  a dinner  and soon after their acquaint began  invit them to dine in harley street  where they had taken a veri good hous for three month  their sister and mrs  jen were invit likewis  and john dashwood was care to secur colonel brandon  who  alway glad to be where the miss dashwood were  receiv his eager civil with some surpris  but much more pleasur  they were to meet mrs  ferrar  but elinor could not learn whether her son were to be of the parti  the expect of see her  howev  was enough to make her interest in the engag  for though she could now meet edward  s mother without that strong anxieti which had onc promis to attend such an introduct  though she could now see her with perfect indiffer as to her opinion of herself  her desir of be in compani with mrs  ferrar  her curios to know what she was like  was as live as ever  the interest with which she thus anticip the parti  was soon afterward increas  more power than pleasant  by her hear that the miss steel were also to be at it  so well had they recommend themselv to ladi middleton  so agreeabl had their assidu made them to her  that though luci was certain not so eleg  and her sister not even genteel  she was as readi as sir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street  and it happen to be particular conveni to the miss steel  as soon as the dashwood  invit was known  that their visit should begin a few day befor the parti took place  their claim to the notic of mrs  john dashwood  as the niec of the gentleman who for mani year had had the care of her brother  might not have done much  howev  toward procur them seat at her tabl  but as ladi middleton  s guest they must be welcom  and luci  who had long want to be person known to the famili  to have a nearer view of their charact and her own difficulti  and to have an opportun of endeavour to pleas them  had seldom been happier in her life  than she was on receiv mrs  john dashwood  s card  on elinor it effect was veri differ  she began immedi to determin  that edward who live with his mother  must be ask as his mother was  to a parti given by his sister  and to see him for the first time  after all that pass  in the compani of luci  she hard knew how she could bear it  these apprehens  perhap  were not found entir on reason  and certain not at all on truth  they were reliev howev  not by her own recollect  but by the good will of luci  who believ herself to be inflict a sever disappoint when she told her that edward certain would not be in harley street on tuesday  and even hope to be carri the pain still farther by persuad her that he was kept away by the extrem affect for herself  which he could not conceal when they were togeth  the import tuesday came that was to introduc the two young ladi to this formid mother  in  law   piti me  dear miss dashwood  said luci  as they walk up the stair togeth  for the middleton arriv so direct after mrs  jen  that they all follow the servant at the same time  there is nobodi here but you  that can feel for me  i declar i can hard stand  good gracious  in a moment i shall see the person that all my happi depend on  that is to be my mother  elinor could have given her immedi relief by suggest the possibl of it be miss morton  s mother  rather than her own  whom they were about to behold  but instead of do that  she assur her  and with great sincer  that she did piti her  to the utter amaz of luci  who  though realli uncomfort herself  hope at least to be an object of irrepress envi to elinor  mrs  ferrar was a littl  thin woman  upright  even to formal  in her figur  and serious  even to sour  in her aspect  her complexion was sallow  and her featur small  without beauti  and natur without express  but a lucki contract of the brow had rescu her counten from the disgrac of insipid  by give it the strong charact of pride and ill natur  she was not a woman of mani word  for  unlik peopl in general  she proport them to the number of her idea  and of the few syllabl that did escap her  not one fell to the share of miss dashwood  whom she eye with the spirit determin of dislik her at all event  elinor could not now be made unhappi by this behaviour  a few month ago it would have hurt her exceed  but it was not in mrs  ferrar  power to distress her by it now  and the differ of her manner to the miss steel  a differ which seem purpos made to humbl her more  onli amus her  she could not but smile to see the gracious of both mother and daughter toward the veri person  for luci was particular distinguish  whom of all other  had they known as much as she did  they would have been most anxious to mortifi  while she herself  who had compar no power to wound them  sat point slight by both  but while she smile at a gracious so misappli  she could not reflect on the mean  spirit folli from which it sprung  nor observ the studi attent with which the miss steel court it continu  without thorough despis them all four  luci was all exult on be so honor distinguish  and miss steel want onli to be teaz about dr  davi to be perfect happi  the dinner was a grand one  the servant were numer  and everi thing bespok the mistress  s inclin for show  and the master  s abil to support it  in spite of the improv and addit which were make to the norland estat  and in spite of it owner have onc been within some thousand pound of be oblig to sell out at a loss  noth gave ani symptom of that indig which he had tri to infer from it  no poverti of ani kind  except of convers  appear  but there  the defici was consider  john dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hear  and his wife had still less  but there was no peculiar disgrac in this  for it was veri much the case with the chief of their visitor  who almost all labour under one or other of these disqualif for be agreeabl  want of sens  either natur or improv  want of eleg  want of spirit  or want of temper  when the ladi withdrew to the draw  room after dinner  this poverti was particular evid  for the gentlemen had suppli the discours with some varieti  the varieti of polit  inclos land  and break hors  but then it was all over  and one subject onli engag the ladi till coffe came in  which was the compar height of harri dashwood  and ladi middleton  s second son william  who were near of the same age  had both the children been there  the affair might have been determin too easili by measur them at onc  but as harri onli was present  it was all conjectur assert on both side  and everi bodi had a right to be equal posit in their opinion  and to repeat it over and over again as often as they like  the parti stood thus  the two mother  though each realli convinc that her own son was the tallest  polit decid

taught her to think of with horror  and urg by a strong impuls of affection sensibl  she move after a moment  to her sister  s chair  and put one arm round her neck  and one cheek close to her  said

and retard the marriag  of edward and herself  had he been otherwis free  and she had seen almost enough to be thank for her own sake  that one greater obstacl preserv her from suffer under ani other

she determin  that had luci been more amiabl  she ought to have rejoic  she wonder that luci  s spirit could be so veri much elev by the civil of mrs  ferrar  that her interest and her vaniti should so veri much blind her as to make the attent which seem onli paid her becaus she was not elinor  appear a compliment to herself  or to allow her to deriv encourag from a prefer onli given her  becaus her real situat was unknown  but that it was so  had not onli been declar by luci  s eye at the time  but was declar over again the next morn more open  for at her particular desir  ladi middleton set

oblig to go on   undoubt  if they had known your engag  said she   noth could be more flatter than their treatment of you  but as that was not the case   i guess you would say so  repli luci quick  but there was no reason in the world whi mrs  ferrar should seem to like me  if she did not  and her like me is everi thing  you shan  t talk me out of my satisfact  i am sure it will all end well  and there will be no difficulti at all  to what i use to think  mrs  ferrar is a charm woman  and so is your sister  they are both delight women  inde  i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeabl mrs  dashwood was  to this elinor had no answer to make  and did not attempt ani   are you ill  miss dashwood  you seem low  you don  t speak  sure you an  t well   i never was in better

were both so good to say more than onc  they should alway be glad to see me  they are such charm women  i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her  you cannot speak too high  but elinor would not give her ani encourag to hope that she should tell her sister  luci continu   i am sure i should have seen it in a moment  if mrs  ferrar had took a dislik to me  if she had onli made me a formal courtesi  for instanc  without say a word  and never after had took ani notic of me  and never look at me in a pleasant way  you know what i mean  if i had been treat in that forbid sort of way  i should have gave it all up in despair  i could not have stood it  for where she doe dislik  i know it is most violent  elinor was prevent from make ani repli to this civil triumph  by the

edward seem to have as great an inclin to walk out of the room again  as to advanc farther into it  the veri circumst  in it unpleasantest form  which they would each have been most anxious to avoid  had fallen on them  they were not onli all three togeth  but were togeth without the relief of ani other person  the ladi recov themselv first  it was not luci  s busi to put herself forward  and the appear of secreci must still be kept up  she could therefor onli look her tender  and after slight address him  said no more  but elinor had more to do  and so anxious was she  for his sake and her own  to do it well  that she forc herself  after a moment  s recollect  to welcom him  with a look and manner that were almost easi  and almost open  and anoth struggl  anoth effort still improv them  she would not allow the presenc of luci  nor the conscious of some injustic toward herself  to deter her from say that she was happi to see him  and that she had veri much regret be from home  when he call befor in berkeley street  she would not be frighten from pay him those attent which  as a friend and almost a relat  were his due  by the observ eye of luci  though she soon perceiv them to be narrowli watch her  her manner gave some re  assur to edward  and he had courag enough to sit down  but his embarrass still exceed that of the ladi in a proport  which the case render reason  though his sex might make it rare  for his heart had not the indiffer of luci  s  nor could his conscienc have quit the eas of elinor  s  luci  with a demur and settl air  seem determin to make no contribut to the comfort of the other  and would not say a word  and almost everi thing that was said  proceed from elinor  who was oblig to volunt all the inform about her mother  s health  their come to town   c  which edward ought to have inquir about  but never did  her exert did not stop here  for she soon afterward felt herself so heroic dispos as to determin  under pretenc of fetch mariann  to leav the other by themselv  and she realli did it  and that in the handsomest manner  for she loiter away sever minut on the land  place  with the most high  mind fortitud  befor she went to her sister  when that was onc done  howev  it was time for the raptur of edward to ceas  for mariann  s joy hurri her into the draw  room immedi  her pleasur in see him was like everi other of her feel  strong in

amend for everi thing  edward tri to return her kind as it deserv  but befor such wit he dare not say half what he realli felt  again they all sat down  and for a moment or two all were silent  while mariann was look with the most speak tender  sometim at edward and sometim at elinor  regret onli that their delight in each other should be check by luci  s unwelcom presenc  edward was the first to speak  and it was to notic mariann  s alter look  and express his fear of her not find london agre with her   oh  don  t think of me  she repli with spirit earnest  though her eye were fill with tear as she spoke   don  t think of my health  elinor is well  you see  that must be enough for us both  this remark was not calcul to make edward or elinor more easi  nor to concili the good will of luci  who look up at mariann with no veri benign express   do you like london  said edward  will to say ani thing that might introduc anoth subject   not at all  i expect much pleasur in it  but i have found none  the sight of you  edward  is the onli comfort it has afford  and thank heaven  you are what you alway were  she paus  no one spoke   i think  elinor  she present ad   we must employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton  in a week or two  i suppos  we shall be go  and  i trust  edward will not be veri unwil to accept the charg  poor edward mutter someth  but what it was  nobodi knew  not even himself  but mariann  who saw his agit  and could easili trace it to whatev caus best pleas herself  was perfect satisfi  and soon talk of someth els   we spent such a day  edward  in harley street yesterday  so dull  so wretch dull  but i have much to say to you on that head  which cannot be said now  and with this admir discret did she defer the assur of her find their

them  littl as well as great  elinor was veri angri  but mariann seem entir insens of the sting  for she calm repli   not so  inde  for  serious speak  i am veri sure that conscienc onli kept edward from harley street  and i realli believ he has the most delic conscienc in the world  the most scrupul in perform everi engag  howev minut  and howev it may make against his interest or pleasur  he is the most fear of give pain  of wound expect  and the most incap of be selfish  of ani bodi i ever saw  edward  it is so  and i will say it  what  are you never to hear yourself prais  then you must be no friend of mine  for those who will accept of my love and esteem  must submit to my open commend  the natur of her commend  in the present case  howev  happen to be particular ill  suit to the feel of two third of her auditor  and was so veri unexhilar to edward  that he veri soon got up to go away   go so soon  said mariann   my dear edward  this must not be  and draw him a littl asid  she whisper her persuas that luci could not stay much longer  but even this encourag fail  for he would go  and luci  who would have outstaid him  had his visit last two hour  soon afterward went away   what can bring her here so often  said mariann  on her leav them   could not she see that we want her gone  how teaz to edward   whi so  we were all his friend  and luci has been the longest known to him of ani  it is but natur that he should like to see her as well as ourselv  mariann look at her steadili  and said   you know  elinor  that this is a kind of talk which i cannot bear  if you onli hope to have your assert contradict  as i must suppos to be the case  you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it  i cannot descend to be trick out of assur  that are not realli want  she then left the room  and elinor dare not follow her to say more  for bound as she was by her promis of secreci to luci  she could give no inform that would convinc mariann  and pain as the consequ of her still continu in an error might be  she was oblig to submit to it  all that she could hope  was that edward would not often expos her or himself to the distress of hear mariann  s mistaken warmth  nor to the repetit of ani other part of the pain that had attend their recent meet  and this she had everi reason to expect  chapter 36 within a few day after this meet  the newspap

day  in everi day in conduit street  for their own comfort they would much rather have remain  at least all the morn  in mrs  jen  s hous  but it was not a thing to be urg against the wish of everybodi  their hour were therefor made over to ladi middleton and the two miss steel  by whom their compani  in fact was as littl valu  as it was profess sought  they had too much sens to be desir companion to the former  and by the latter they were consid with a jealous eye  as intrud on their ground  and share the kind which they want to monopol  though noth could be more polit than ladi middleton  s behaviour to elinor and mariann  she did not realli like them at all  becaus they neither flatter herself nor her children  she could not believ them good  natur  and becaus they were fond of read  she fanci them satir  perhap without exact know what it was to be satir  but that did not signifi  it was censur in common use  and easili given  their presenc was a restraint both on her and on luci  it check the idl of one  and the busi of the other  ladi middleton was asham of do noth befor them  and the flatteri which luci was proud to think of and administ at other time  she fear they would despis her for offer  miss steel was the least discompos of the three  by their presenc  and it was in their power to reconcil her to it entir  would either of them onli have given her a full and minut account of the whole affair between mariann and mr  willoughbi  she would have thought herself ampli reward for the sacrific of the best place by the fire after dinner  which their arriv occas  but this concili was not grant  for though she often threw out express of piti for her sister to elinor  and more than onc dropt a reflect on the inconst of beaux befor mariann  no effect was produc  but a look of indiffer from the former  or of disgust in the latter  an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend  would they onli have laugh at her about the doctor  but so littl were they  anymor than the other  inclin to oblig her  that if sir john dine from home  she might spend a whole day without hear ani other railleri on the subject  than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself  all these jealousi and discont  howev  were so total unsuspect by mrs  jen  that she thought it a delight thing for the girl to be togeth  and general congratul her young friend everi night  on have escap the compani of a stupid old woman so long  she join them sometim at sir john  s  sometim at her own hous  but wherev it was  she alway came in excel spirit  full of delight

even be brought to acknowledg the simpl proposit of it be the finest child in the world  i come now to the relat of a misfortun  which about this time befel mrs  john dashwood  it so happen that while her two sister with mrs  jen were first call on her in harley street  anoth of her acquaint had dropt in  a circumst in itself not appar like to produc evil to her  but while the imagin of other peopl will carri them away to form wrong judgment of our conduct  and to decid on it by slight appear  one  s happi must in some measur be alway at the merci of chanc  in the present instanc  this last  arriv ladi allow her fanci to so far outrun truth and probabl  that on mere hear the name of the miss dashwood  and understand them to be mr  dashwood  s sister  she immedi conclud them to be stay in harley street  and this misconstruct produc within a day or two afterward  card of invit for them as well as for their brother and sister  to a small music parti at her hous  the consequ of which was  that mrs  john dashwood was oblig to submit not onli to the exceed great inconveni of send her carriag for the miss dashwood  but  what was still wors  must be subject to all the unpleas of appear to treat them with attent  and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time  the power of disappoint them  it was true  must alway be her  s  but that was not enough  for when peopl are determin on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong  they feel injur by the expect of ani thing better from them  mariann had now been brought by degre  so much into the habit of go out everi day  that it was becom a matter of indiffer to her  whether she went or not  and she prepar quiet and mechan for everi even  s engag  though without expect the smallest amus from ani  and veri often without know  till the last moment  where it was to take her  to her dress and appear she was grown so perfect indiffer  as not to bestow half the consider on it  dure the whole of her

never easi till she knew the price of everi part of mariann  s dress  could have guess the number of her gown altogeth with better judgment than mariann herself  and was not without hope of find out befor they part  how much her wash cost per week  and how much she had everi year to spend upon herself  the impertin of these kind of scrutini  moreov  was general conclud with a compliment  which though meant as it douceur  was consid by mariann as the greatest impertin of all  for after undergo an examin into the valu and make of her gown  the colour of her shoe  and the arrang of her hair  she was almost sure of be told that upon  her word she look vast smart  and she dare to say she would make a great mani conquest  with such encourag as this  was she dismiss on the present occas  to her brother  s carriag  which they were readi to enter five minut after it stop at the door  a punctual not veri agreeabl to their sister  in  law  who had preced them to the hous of her acquaint  and

at gray  s  she perceiv him soon afterward look at herself  and speak familiar to her brother  and had just determin to find out his name from the latter  when they both came toward her  and mr  dashwood introduc him to her as mr  robert ferrar  he address her with easi civil  and twist his head into a bow which assur her as plain as word could have done  that he was exact the coxcomb she had heard him describ to be by luci  happi had it been for her  if her regard for edward had depend less on his own merit  than on the merit of his nearest relat  for then his brother  s bow must have given the finish stroke to what the ill  humour of his mother and sister would have begun  but while she wonder at the differ of the two young men  she did not find that the empti of conceit of the one  put her out of all chariti with the modesti and worth of the other  whi they were differ  robert exclaim to her himself in the cours of a quarter of an hour  s convers  for  talk of his brother  and lament the extrem gaucheri which he realli believ kept him from mix in proper societi  he candid and generous attribut it much less to ani natur defici  than to the misfortun of a privat educ  while he himself  though probabl without ani particular  ani materi superior by natur  mere from the advantag of a public school  was as well fit to mix in the world as ani other man   upon my soul  he ad   i believ it is noth more  and so i often tell my mother  when she is griev about it   my dear madam  i alway say to her   you must make yourself easi  the evil is now irremedi  and it has been entir your own do  whi would you be persuad by my uncl  sir robert  against your own judgment  to place edward under privat tuition  at the most critic time of his life  if you had onli sent him to westminst as well as myself  instead of send him to mr  pratt  s  all this would have been prevent  this is the way in which i alway consid the matter  and my mother is perfect convinc of her error  elinor would not oppos his opinion  becaus  whatev might be her general estim of the advantag of a public school  she could not think of edward  s abod in mr  pratt  s famili  with ani satisfact   you resid in devonshir  i think  was his next observ   in a cottag near dawlish  elinor set him right as to it situat  and it seem rather surpris to him that anybodi could live in devonshir  without live near dawlish  he bestow his hearti approb howev on their speci of hous   for my own part  said he   i am excess fond of a cottag  there is alway so much comfort  so much eleg about them  and i protest  if i had ani money to spare  i should buy a littl land and build one myself  within a short distanc of london  where i might drive myself down at ani time  and collect a few friend about me  and be happi  i advis everi bodi who is go to build  to build a cottag  my friend lord courtland came to me the other day on purpos to ask my advic  and laid befor me three differ plan of bonomi  s  i was to decid on the best of them   my dear courtland  said i  immedi throw them all into the fire   do not adopt either of them  but by all mean build a cottag  and that i fanci  will be the end of it   some peopl imagin that there can be no accommod  no space in a cottag  but this is all a mistak  i was last month at my friend elliott  s  near dartford  ladi elliott wish to give a danc   but how can it be done  said she   my dear ferrar  do tell me how it is to be manag  there is not a room in this cottag that will hold ten coupl  and where can the supper be  i immedi saw that there could be no difficulti in it  so i said   my dear ladi elliott  do not be uneasi  the dine parlour will admit eighteen coupl with eas  card  tabl may be place in the draw  room  the librari may be open for tea and other refresh  and let the supper be set out in the saloon  ladi elliott was delight with the thought  we measur the dine  room  and found it would hold exact eighteen coupl  and the affair was arrang precis after my plan  so that  in fact  you see  if peopl do but know how to set about it  everi comfort may be as well enjoy in a cottag as in the most spacious dwell  elinor agre to it all  for she did not think he deserv the compliment of ration opposit  as john dashwood had no more pleasur in music than his eldest sister  his mind was equal at liberti to fix on ani thing els  and a thought struck him dure the even  which he communic to his wife  for her approb  when they got home  the consider of mrs  dennison  s mistak  in suppos his sister their guest  had suggest the

his sister anoth year  at the same time  howev  slyli suspect that anoth year would make the invit needless  by bring elinor to town as colonel brandon  s wife  and mariann as their visitor  fanni  rejoic in her escap  and proud of the readi wit that had procur it  wrote the next morn to luci  to request her compani and her sister  s  for some day  in harley street  as soon as ladi middleton could spare them  this was enough to make luci realli and reason happi  mrs  dashwood seem actual work for her  herself  cherish all her hope  and promot all her view  such an opportun of be with edward and his famili was  abov all thing  the most materi to her interest  and such an invit the most gratifi to her feel  it was an advantag that could not be too grate acknowledg  nor too speedili made use of  and the visit to ladi middleton  which had not befor had ani precis limit  was instant discov to have been alway meant to end in two day  time  when the note was shown to elinor  as it was within ten minut after it arriv  it gave her  for the first time  some share in the expect of luci  for such a mark of uncommon kind  vouchsaf on so short an acquaint  seem to declar that the good  will toward her aros from someth more than mere malic against herself  and might be brought  by time and address  to do everi thing that luci wish  her flatteri had alreadi subdu the pride of ladi middleton  and made an entri into the close heart of mrs  john dashwood  and these were effect that laid open the probabl of greater  the miss steel remov to harley street  and all that reach elinor of their influenc there  strengthen her expect of the event  sir john  who call on them more than onc  brought home such account of the favour they were in  as must be univers strike  mrs  dashwood had never been so much pleas with ani young women in her life  as she was with them  had given each of them a needl book made by some emigr  call luci by her christian name  and did not know whether she should ever be abl to part with them   at this point in the first and second edtion  volum ii end  chapter 37 mrs  palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight  that her mother felt it no longer necessari to give up the whole of her time to her  and  content herself with visit her onc or twice a day  return from that period to her own home  and her own habit  in which she found the miss dashwood veri readi to resum their former share  about the third or fourth morn after their be thus resettl in berkeley street  mrs  jen  on return from her ordinari visit to mrs  palmer  enter the draw  room  where elinor was sit by herself  with an air of such hurri import as prepar her to hear someth wonder  and give her time onli to form that idea  began direct to justifi it  by say   lord  my dear miss dashwood  have you heard the news   no  ma  am  what is it   someth so strang  but you shall hear it all  when i got to mr  palmer  s  i found charlott quit in a fuss about the child  she was sure it was veri ill  it cri  and fret  and was all over pimpl  so i look at it direct  and   lord  my dear  say i   it is noth in the world  but the red gum  and nurs said just the same  but charlott  she would not be satisfi  so mr  donavan was sent for  and luckili he happen to just come in from harley street  so he step over direct  and as soon as ever he saw the child  be said just as we did  that it was noth in the world but the red gum  and then charlott was easi  and so  just as he was go away again  it came into my head  i am sure i do not know how i happen to think of it  but it came into my head to ask him if there was ani news  so upon that  he smirk  and simper  and look grave  and seem to know someth or other  and at last he said in a whisper   for fear ani unpleas report should reach the young ladi under your care as to their sister  s indisposit  i think it advis to say  that i believ there is no great reason for alarm  i hope mrs  dashwood will do veri well   what  is fanni ill   that is exact what i said  my dear   lord  say i   is mrs  dashwood ill  so then it all came out  and the long and the short of the matter  by all i can learn  seem to be this  mr  edward ferrar  the veri young man i use to joke with you about  but howev  as it turn out  i am monstrous glad there was never ani thing in it  mr  edward ferrar  it seem  has been engag abov this twelvemonth to my cousin luci  there  s for you  my dear  and not a creatur know a syllabl of the matter  except nanci  could you have believ such a thing possibl  there is no great wonder in their like one anoth  but that matter should be brought so forward between them  and nobodi suspect it  that is strang  i never happen to see them togeth  or i am sure i should have found it out direct  well  and so this was kept a great secret  for fear of mrs  ferrar  and neither she nor your brother or sister suspect a word of the matter  till this veri morn  poor nanci  who  you know  is a well  mean creatur  but no conjur  popt it all out   lord  think she to herself   they are all so fond of luci  to be sure they will make no difficulti about it  and so  away she went to your sister  who was sit all alon at her carpet  work  littl suspect what was to come  for she had just been say to your brother  onli five minut befor  that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord  s daughter or other  i forget who  so you may think what a blow it was to all her vaniti and pride  she fell into violent hyster immedi  with such scream as reach your brother  s ear  as he was sit in his own dress  room down stair  think about write a letter to his steward in the countri  so up he flew direct  and a terribl scene took place  for luci was come to them by that time  littl dream what was go on  poor soul  i piti her  and i must say  i think she was use veri hard  for your sister scold like ani furi  and soon drove her into a faint fit  nanci  she fell upon her knee  and cri bitter  and your brother  he walk about the room  and said he did not know what to do  mrs  dashwood declar they should not stay a minut longer in the hous  and your brother was forc to go down upon his knee too  to persuad her to let them stay till they had pack up their cloth  then she fell into hyster again  and he was so frighten that he would send for mr  donavan  and mr  donavan found the hous in all this uproar  the carriag was at the door readi to take my poor cousin away  and they were just step in as he came off  poor luci in such a condit  he say  she could hard walk  and nanci  she was almost as bad  i declar  i have no patienc with your sister  and i hope  with all my heart  it will be a match in spite of her  lord  what a take poor mr  edward will be in when he hear of it  to have his love use so scorn  for they say he is monstrous fond of her  as well he may  i should not wonder  if he was to be in the greatest passion  and mr  donavan think just the same  he and i had a great deal of talk about it  and the best of all is  that he is gone back again to harley street  that he may be within call when mrs  ferrar is told of it  for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousin left the hous  for your sister was sure she would be in hyster too  and so she may  for what i care  i have no piti for either of them  i have no notion of peopl  s make such a to  do about money and great  there is no reason on earth whi mr  edward and luci should not marri  for i am sure mrs  ferrar may afford to do veri well by her son  and though luci has next to noth herself  she know better than ani bodi how to make the most of everi thing  i dare say  if mrs  ferrar would onli allow him five hundr a  year  she would make as good an appear with it as ani bodi els would with eight  lord  how snug they might live in such anoth cottag as your  or a littl bigger  with two maid  and two men  and i believ i could help them to a housemaid  for my betti has a sister out of place  that would fit them exact  here mrs  jen ceas  and as elinor had had time enough to collect her thought  she was abl to give such an answer  and make such observ  as the subject might natur be suppos to produc  happi to find that she was not suspect of ani extraordinari interest in it  that mrs  jen  as she had of late often hope might be the case  had ceas to imagin her at all attach to edward  and happi abov all the rest  in the absenc of mariann  she felt veri well abl to speak of the affair without embarrass  and to give her judgment  as she believ  with imparti on the conduct of everi one concern in it  she could hard determin what her own expect of it event realli was  though she earnest tri to drive away the notion of it be possibl to end otherwis at last  than in the marriag of edward and luci  what mrs  ferrar would say and do  though there could not be a doubt of it natur  she was anxious to hear  and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct himself  for him she felt much compass  for luci veri littl  and it cost her some pain to procur that littl  for the rest of the parti none at all  as mrs  jen could talk on no other subject  elinor soon saw the necess of prepar mariann for it discuss  no time was to be lost in undeceiv her  in make her acquaint with the real truth  and in endeavour to bring her to hear it talk of by other  without betray that she felt ani uneasi for her sister  or ani resent against edward  elinor  s offic was a pain one  she was go to remov what she realli believ to be her sister  s chief consol  to give such particular of edward as she fear would ruin him for ever in her good opinion  and to make mariann  by a resembl in their situat  which to her fanci would seem strong  feel all her own disappoint over again  but unwelcom as such a task must be  it was necessari to be done  and elinor therefor hasten to perform it  she was veri far from wish to dwell on her own feel  or to repres herself as suffer much  ani otherwis than as the self  command she had practis sinc her first knowledg of edward  s engag  might suggest a hint of what was practic to mariann  her narrat was clear and simpl  and though it could not be given without emot  it was not accompani by violent agit  nor impetu grief  that belong rather to the hearer  for mariann listen with horror  and cri excess  elinor was to be the comfort of other in her own distress  no less than in their  and all the comfort that could be given by assur of her own composur of mind  and a veri earnest vindic of edward from everi charg but of imprud  was readili offer  but mariann for some time would give credit to neither  edward seem a second willoughbi  and acknowledg as elinor did  that she had love him most sincer  could she feel less than herself  as for luci steel  she consid her so total unami  so absolut incap of attach a sensibl man  that she could not be persuad at first to believ  and afterward to pardon  ani former affect of edward for her  she would not even admit it to have been natur  and elinor left her to be convinc that it was so  by that which onli could convinc her  a better knowledg of mankind  her first communic had reach no farther than to state the fact of the engag  and the length of time it had exist  mariann  s feel had then broken in  and put an end to all regular of detail  and for some time all that could be done was to sooth her distress  lessen her alarm  and combat her resent  the first question on her side  which led to farther particular  was   how long has this been known to you  elinor  has he written to you   i have known it these four month  when luci first came to barton park last novemb  she told me in confid of her engag  at these word  mariann  s eye express the astonish which her lip could not utter  after a paus of wonder  she exclaim   four month  have you known of this four month  elinor confirm it   what  while attend me in all my miseri  has this been on your heart  and i have reproach you for be happi   it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the revers   four month  cri mariann again  so calm  so cheer  how have you been support   by feel that i was do my duti  my promis to luci  oblig me to be secret  i owe it to her  therefor  to avoid give ani hint of the truth  and i owe it to my famili and friend  not to creat in them a solicitud about me  which it could not be in my power to satisfi  mariann seem much struck   i have veri often wish to undec yourself and my mother  ad elinor   and onc or twice i have attempt it  but without betray my trust  i never could have convinc you   four month  and yet you love him   yes  but i did not love onli him  and while the comfort of other was dear to me  i was glad to spare them from know how much i felt  now  i can think and speak of it with littl emot  i would not have you suffer on my account  for i assur you i no longer suffer materi myself  i have mani thing to support me  i am not conscious of have provok the disappoint by ani imprud of my own  i have born it as much as possibl without spread it farther  i acquit edward of essenti misconduct  i wish him veri happi  and i am so sure of his alway do his duti  that though now he may harbour some regret  in the end he must becom so  luci doe not want sens  and that is the foundat on which everi thing good may be built  and after all  mariann  after all that is bewitch in the idea of a singl and constant attach  and all that can be said of one  s happi depend entir on ani particular person  it is not meant  it is not fit  it is not possibl that it should be so  edward will marri luci  he will marri a woman superior in person and understand to half her sex  and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought anoth superior to her   if such is your way of think  said mariann   if the loss of what is most valu is so easili to be made up by someth els  your resolut  your self  command  are  perhap  a littl less to be wonder at  they are brought more within my comprehens   i understand you  you do not suppos that i have ever felt much  for four month  mariann  i have had all this hang on my mind  without be at liberti to speak of it to a singl creatur  know that it would make you and my mother most unhappi whenev it were explain to you  yet unabl to prepar you for it in the least  it was told me  it was in a manner forc on me by the veri person herself  whose prior engag ruin all my prospect  and told me  as i thought  with triumph  this person  s suspicion  therefor  i have had to oppos  by endeavour to appear indiffer where i have been most deepli interest  and it has not been onli onc  i have had her hope and exult to listen to again and again  i have known myself to be divid from edward for ever  without hear one circumst that could make me less desir the connect  noth has prove him unworthi  nor has anyth declar him indiffer to me  i have had to contend against the unkind of his sister  and the insol of his mother  and have suffer the punish of an attach  without enjoy it advantag  and all this has been go on at a time  when  as you know too well  it has not been my onli unhappi  if you can think me capabl of ever feel  sure you may suppos that i have suffer now  the composur of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consid the matter  the consol that i have been will to admit  have been the effect of constant and pain exert  they did not spring up of themselv  they did not occur to reliev my spirit at first  no  mariann  then  if i had not been bound to silenc  perhap noth could have kept me entir  not even what i owe to my dearest friend  from open shew that i was veri unhappi  mariann was quit subdu   oh  elinor  she cri   you have made me hate myself for ever  how barbar have i been to you  you  who have been my onli comfort  who have born with me in all my miseri  who have seem to be onli suffer for me  is this my gratitud  is this the onli return i can make you  becaus your merit cri out upon myself  i have been tri to do it away  the tenderest caress follow this confess  in such a frame of mind as she was now in  elinor had no difficulti in obtain from her whatev promis she requir  and at her request  mariann engag never to speak of the affair to ani one with the least appear of bitter  to meet luci without betray the smallest increas of dislik to her  and even to see edward himself  if chanc should bring them togeth  without ani diminut of her usual cordial  these were great concess  but where mariann felt that she had injur  no repar could be too much for her to make  she perform her promis of be discreet  to admir  she attend to all that mrs  jen had to say upon the subject  with an unchang complexion  dissent from her in noth  and was heard three time to say   yes  ma  am  she listen to her prais of luci with onli move from one chair to anoth  and when mrs  jen talk of edward  s affect  it cost her onli a spasm in her throat  such advanc toward heroism in her sister  made elinor feel equal to ani thing herself  the next morn brought a farther trial of it  in a visit from their brother  who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dread affair  and bring them news of his wife   you have heard  i suppos  said he with great solemn  as soon as he was seat   of the veri shock discoveri that took place under our roof yesterday  they all look their assent  it seem too aw a moment for speech   your sister  he continu   has suffer dread  mrs  ferrar too  in short it has been a scene of such complic distress  but i will hope that the storm may be weather without our be ani of us quit overcom  poor fanni  she was in hyster all yesterday  but i would not alarm you too much  donavan say there is noth materi to be apprehend  her constitut is a good one  and her resolut equal to ani thing  she has born it all  with the fortitud of an angel  she say she never shall think well of anybodi again  and one cannot wonder at it  after be so deceiv  meet with such ingratitud  where so much kind had been shewn  so much confid had been place  it was quit out of the benevol of her heart  that she had ask these young women to her hous  mere becaus she thought they deserv some attent  were harmless  well  behav girl  and would be pleasant companion  for otherwis we both wish veri much to have invit you and mariann to be with us  while your kind friend there  was attend her daughter  and now to be so reward   i wish  with all my heart  say poor fanni in her affection way   that we had ask your sister instead of them  here he stop to be thank  which be done  he went on   what poor mrs  ferrar suffer  when first fanni broke it to her  is not to be describ  while she with the truest affect had been plan a most elig connect for him  was it to be suppos that he could be all the time secret engag to anoth person  such a suspicion could never have enter her head  if she suspect ani prepossess elsewher  it could not be in that quarter   there  to be sure  said she   i might have thought myself safe  she was quit in an agoni  we consult togeth  howev  as to what should be done  and at last she determin to send for edward  he came  but i am sorri to relat what ensu  all that mrs  ferrar could say to make him put an end to the engag  assist too as you may well suppos by my argument  and fanni  s entreati  was of no avail  duti  affect  everi thing was disregard  i never thought edward so stubborn  so unfeel befor  his mother explain to him her liber design  in case of his marri miss morton  told him she would settl on him the norfolk estat  which  clear of land  tax  bring in a good thousand a  year  offer even  when matter grew desper  to make it twelv hundr  and in opposit to this  if he still persist in this low connect  repres to him the certain penuri that must attend the match  his own two thousand pound she protest should be his all  she would never see him again  and so far would she be from afford him the smallest assist  that if he were to enter into ani profess with a view of better support  she would do all in her power to prevent him advanc in it  here mariann  in an ecstasi of indign  clap her hand togeth  and cri   gracious god  can this be possibl   well may you wonder  mariann  repli her brother   at the obstinaci which could resist such argument as these  your exclam is veri natur  mariann was go to retort  but she rememb her promis  and forbor   all this  howev  he continu   was urg in vain  edward said veri littl  but what he did say  was in the most determin manner  noth should prevail on him to give up his engag  he would stand to it  cost him what it might   then  cri mrs  jen with blunt sincer  no longer abl to be silent   he has act like an honest man  i beg your pardon  mr  dashwood  but if he had done otherwis  i should have thought him a rascal  i have some littl concern in the busi  as well as yourself  for luci steel is my cousin  and i believ there is not a better kind of girl in the world  nor one who more deserv a good husband  john dashwood was great astonish  but his natur was calm  not open to provoc  and he never wish to offend anybodi  especi anybodi of good fortun  he therefor repli  without ani resent   i would by no mean speak disrespect of ani relat of your  madam  miss luci steel is  i dare say  a veri deserv young woman  but in the present case you know  the connect must be imposs  and to have enter into a secret engag with a young man under her uncl  s care  the son of a woman especi of such veri larg fortun as mrs  ferrar  is perhap  altogeth a littl extraordinari  in short  i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of ani person whom you have a regard for  mrs  jen  we all wish her extrem happi  and mrs  ferrar  s conduct throughout the whole  has been such as everi conscienti  good mother  in like circumst  would adopt  it has been dignifi and liber  edward has drawn his own lot  and i fear it will be a bad one  mariann sigh out her similar apprehens  and elinor  s heart wrung for the feel of edward  while brave his mother  s threat  for a woman who could not reward him   well  sir  said mrs  jen   and how did it end   i am sorri to say  ma  am  in a most unhappi ruptur  edward is dismiss for ever from his mother  s notic  he left her hous yesterday  but where he is gone  or whether he is still in town  i do not know  for we of cours can make no inquiri   poor young man  and what is to becom of him   what  inde  ma  am  it is a melancholi consider  born to the prospect of such affluenc  i cannot conceiv a situat more deplor  the interest of two thousand pound  how can a man live on it  and when to that is ad the recollect  that he might  but for his own folli  within three month have been in the receipt of two thousand  five hundr a  year  for miss morton has thirti thousand pound  i cannot pictur to myself a more wretch condit  we must all feel for him  and the more so  becaus it is total out of our power to assist him   poor young man  cri mrs  jen   i am sure he should be veri welcom to bed and board at my hous  and so i would tell him if i could see him  it is not fit that he should be live about at his own charg now  at lodg and tavern  elinor  s heart thank her for such kind toward edward  though she could not forbear smile at the form of it   if he would onli have done as well by himself  said john dashwood   as all his friend were dispos to do by him  he might now have been in his proper situat  and would have want for noth  but as it is  it must be out of anybodi  s power to assist him  and there is one thing more prepar against him  which must be wors than all  his mother has determin  with a veri natur kind of spirit  to settl that estat upon robert immedi  which might have been edward  s  on proper condit  i left her this morn with her lawyer  talk over the busi   well  said mrs  jen   that is her reveng  everybodi has a way of their own  but i don  t think mine would be  to make one son independ  becaus anoth had plagu me  mariann got up and walk about the room   can anyth be more gall to the spirit of a man  continu john   than to see his younger brother in possess of an estat which might have been his own  poor edward  i feel for him sincer  a few minut more spent in the same kind of effus  conclud his visit  and with repeat assur to his sister that he realli believ there was no materi danger in fanni  s indisposit  and that they need not therefor be veri uneasi about it  he went away  leav the three ladi unanim in their sentiment on the present occas  as far at least as it regard mrs  ferrar  s conduct  the dashwood  and edward  s  mariann  s indign burst forth as soon as he quit the room  and as her vehem made reserv imposs in elinor  and unnecessari in mrs  jen  they all join in a veri spirit critiqu upon the parti  chapter 38 mrs  jen was veri warm in her prais of edward  s conduct  but onli elinor and mariann understood it true merit  they onli knew how littl he had had to tempt him to be disobedi  and how small was the consol  beyond the conscious of do right  that could remain to him in the loss of friend and fortun  elinor glori in his integr  and mariann forgav all his offenc in compass for his punish  but though confid between them was  by this public discoveri  restor to it proper state  it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwell when alon  elinor avoid it upon principl  as tend to fix still more upon her thought  by the too warm  too posit assur of mariann  that belief of edward  s continu affect for herself which she rather wish to do away  and mariann  s courag soon fail her  in tri to convers upon a topic which alway left her more dissatisfi with herself than ever  by the comparison it necessarili produc between elinor  s conduct and her own  she felt all the forc of that comparison  but not as her sister had hope  to urg her to exert now  she felt it with all the pain of continu self  reproach  regret most bitter that she had never exert herself befor  but it brought onli the tortur of penit  without the hope of amend  her mind was so much weaken that she still fanci present exert imposs  and therefor it onli dispirit her more  noth new was heard by them  for a day or two afterward  of affair in harley street  or bartlett  s build  but though so much of the matter was known to them alreadi  that mrs  jen might have had enough to do in spread that knowledg farther  without seek after more  she had resolv from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiri to her cousin as soon as she could  and noth but the hindranc of more visitor than usual  had prevent her go to them within that time  the third day succeed their knowledg of the particular  was so fine  so beauti a sunday as to draw mani to kensington garden  though it was onli the second week in march  mrs  jen and elinor were of the number  but mariann  who knew that the willoughbi were again in town  and had a constant dread of meet them  chose rather to stay at home  than ventur into so public a place  an intim acquaint of mrs  jen join them soon after they enter the garden  and elinor was not sorri that by her continu with them  and engag all mrs  jen  s convers  she was herself left to quiet reflect  she saw noth of the willoughbi  noth of edward  and for some time noth of anybodi who could by ani chanc whether grave or gay  be interest to her  but at last she found herself with some surpris  accost by miss steel  who  though look rather shi  express great satisfact in meet them  and on receiv encourag from the particular kind of mrs  jen  left her own parti for a short time  to join their  s  mrs  jen immedi whisper to elinor   get it all out of her  my dear  she will tell you ani thing if you ask  you see i cannot leav mrs  clark  it was lucki  howev  for mrs  jen  s curios and elinor  s too  that she would tell ani thing without be ask  for noth would otherwis have been learnt   i am so glad to meet you  said miss steel  take her familiar by the arm  for i want to see you of all thing in the world  and then lower her voic   i suppos mrs  jen has heard all about it  is she angri   not at all  i believ  with you   that is a good thing  and ladi middleton  is she angri   i cannot suppos it possibl that she should   i am monstrous glad of it  good gracious  i have had such a time of it  i never saw luci in such a rage in my life  she vow at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet  nor do ani thing els for me again  so long as she live  but now she is quit come to  and we are as good friend as ever  look  she made me this bow to my hat  and put in the feather last night  there now  you are go to laugh at me too  but whi should not i wear pink ribbon  i do not care if it is the doctor  s favourit colour  i am sure  for my part  i should never have known he did like it better than ani other colour  if he had not happen to say so  my cousin have been so plagu me  i declar sometim i do not know which way to look befor them  she had wander away to a subject on which elinor had noth to say  and therefor soon judg it expedi to find her way back again to the first   well  but miss dashwood  speak triumphant   peopl may say what they chuse about mr  ferrar  s declar he would not have luci  for it is no such thing i can tell you  and it is quit a shame for such ill  natur report to be spread abroad  whatev luci might think about it herself  you know  it was no busi of other peopl to set it down for certain   i never heard ani thing of the kind hint at befor  i assur you  said elinor   oh  did not you  but it was said  i know  veri well  and by more than one  for miss godbi told miss spark  that nobodi in their sens could expect mr  ferrar to give up a woman like miss morton  with thirti thousand pound to her fortun  for luci steel that had noth at all  and i had it from miss spark myself  and besid that  my cousin richard said himself  that when it came to the point he was afraid mr  ferrar would be off  and when edward did not come near us for three day  i could not tell what to think myself  and i believ in my heart luci gave it up all for lost  for we came away from your brother  s wednesday  and we saw noth of him not all thursday  friday  and saturday  and did not know what was becom of him  onc luci thought to write to him  but then her spirit rose against that  howev this morn he came just as we came home from church  and then it all came out  how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street  and been talk to by his mother and all of them  and how he had declar befor them all that he love nobodi but luci  and nobodi but luci would he have  and how he had been so worri by what pass  that as soon as he had went away from his mother  s hous  he had got upon his hors  and rid into the countri  some where or other  and how he had stay about at an inn all thursday and friday  on purpos to get the better of it  and after think it all over and over again  he said  it seem to him as if  now he had no fortun  and no noth at all  it would be quit unkind to keep her on to the engag  becaus it must be for her loss  for he had noth but two thousand pound  and no hope of ani thing els  and if he was to go into order  as he had some thought  he could get noth but a curaci  and how was they to live upon that  he could not bear to think of her do no better  and so he beg  if she had the least mind for it  to put an end to the matter direct  and leav him shift for himself  i heard him say all this as plain as could possibl be  and it was entir for her sake  and upon her account  that he said a word about be off  and not upon his own  i will take my oath he never dropt a syllabl of be tire of her  or of wish to marri miss morton  or ani thing like it  but  to be sure  luci would not give ear to such kind of talk  so she told him direct  with a great deal about sweet and love  you know  and all that  oh  la  one can  t repeat such kind of thing you know  she told him direct  she had not the least mind in the world to be off  for she could live with him upon a trifl  and how littl so ever he might have  she should be veri glad to have it all  you know  or someth of the kind  so then he was monstrous happi  and talk on some time about what they should do  and they agre he should take order direct  and they must wait to be marri till he got a live  and just then i could not hear ani more  for my cousin call from below to tell me mrs  richardson was come in her coach  and would take one of us to kensington garden  so i was forc to go into the room and interrupt them  to ask luci if she would like to go  but she did not care to leav edward  so i just run up stair and put on a pair of silk stock and came off with the richardson   i do not understand what you mean by interrupt them  said elinor   you were all in the same room togeth  were not you   no  inde  not us  la  miss dashwood  do you think peopl make love when ani bodi els is by  oh  for shame  to be sure you must know better than that   laugh affect  no  no  they were shut up in the draw  room togeth  and all i heard was onli by listen at the door   how  cri elinor   have you been repeat to me what you onli learnt yourself by listen at the door  i am sorri i did not know it befor  for i certain would not have suffer you to give me particular of a convers which you ought not to have known yourself  how could you behav so unfair by your sister   oh  la  there is noth in that  i onli stood at the door  and heard what i could  and i am sure luci would have done just the same by me  for a year or two back  when martha sharp and i had so mani secret togeth  she never made ani bone of hide in a closet  or behind a chimney  board  on purpos to hear what we said  elinor tri to talk of someth els  but miss steel could not be kept beyond a coupl of minut  from what was uppermost in her mind   edward talk of go to oxford soon  said she   but now he is lodg at no   pall mall  what an ill  natur woman his mother is  an  t she  and your brother and sister were not veri kind  howev  i shan  t say anyth against them to you  and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot  which was more than i look for  and for my part  i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswif she had gave us a day or two befor  but  howev  noth was said about them  and i took care to keep mine out of sight  edward have got some busi at oxford  he say  so he must go there for a time  and after that  as soon as he can light upon a bishop  he will be ordain  i wonder what curaci he will get  good gracious   giggl as she spoke  i  d lay my life i know what my cousin will say  when they hear of it  they will tell me i should write to the doctor  to get edward the curaci of his new live  i know they will  but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world   la  i shall say direct   i wonder how you could think of such a thing  i write to the doctor  inde   well  said elinor   it is a comfort to be prepar against the worst  you have got your answer readi  miss steel was go to repli on the same subject  but the approach of her own parti made anoth more necessari   oh  la  here come the richardson  i had a vast deal more to say to you  but i must not stay away from them not ani longer  i assur you they are veri genteel peopl  he make a monstrous deal of money  and they keep their own coach  i have not time to speak to mrs  jen about it myself  but pray tell her i am quit happi to hear she is not in anger against us  and ladi middleton the same  and if anyth should happen to take you and your sister away  and mrs  jen should want compani  i am sure we should be veri glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she like  i suppos ladi middleton won  t ask us ani more this bout  good  by  i am sorri miss mariann was not here  rememb me kind to her  la  if you have not got your spot muslin on  i wonder you was not afraid of it be torn  such was her part concern  for after this  she had time onli to pay her farewel compliment to mrs  jen  befor her compani was claim by mrs  richardson  and elinor was left in possess of knowledg which might feed her power of reflect some time  though she had learnt veri littl more than what had been alreadi foreseen and foreplan in her own mind  edward  s marriag with luci was as firm determin on  and the time of it take place remain as absolut uncertain  as she had conclud it would be  everi thing depend  exact after her expect  on his get that prefer  of which  at present  there seem not the smallest chanc  as soon as they return to the carriag  mrs  jen was eager for inform  but as elinor wish to spread as littl as possibl intellig that had in the first place been so unfair obtain  she confin herself to the brief repetit of such simpl particular  as she felt assur that luci  for the sake of her own consequ  would choos to have known  the continu of their engag  and the mean that were abl to be taken for promot it end  was all

to blame for what she did  but she did it for the best  so i say noth  hope mrs  jen won  t think it too much troubl to give us a call  should she come this way ani morn   twould be a great kind  and my cousin would be proud to know her  my paper remind me to conclud  and beg to be most grate and respect rememb to her  and to sir john  and ladi middleton  and the dear children  when you chanc to

mani comment of satisfact and prais   veri well inde  how prettili she write  aye  that was quit proper to let him be off if he would  that was just like luci  poor soul  i wish i could get him a live  with all my heart  she call me dear mrs  jen  you see  she is a good  heart girl as ever live  veri well upon my word  that sentenc is veri prettili turn  yes  yes  i will go and see her  sure enough  how attent she is  to think of everi bodi  thank you  my dear  for shew it me  it is as pretti a letter as ever i saw  and doe luci  s head and heart great credit  chapter 39 the miss dashwood had now been rather more than two month in town  and mariann  s impati to be gone increas everi day  she sigh for the air  the liberti  the quiet of the countri  and fanci that if ani place could give her eas  barton must do it  elinor was hard less anxious than herself for their remov  and onli so much less bent on it be effect immedi  as that she was conscious of the difficulti of so long a journey  which mariann could not be brought to acknowledg  she began  howev  serious to turn her thought toward it accomplish  and had alreadi mention their wish to their kind hostess  who resist them with all the eloqu of her good  will  when a plan was suggest  which  though detain them from home yet a few week longer  appear to elinor altogeth much more elig than ani other  the palmer were to remov to cleveland about the end of march  for the easter holiday  and mrs  jen  with both her friend  receiv a veri warm invit from charlott to go with them  this would not  in itself  have been suffici for the delicaci of miss dashwood  but it was inforc with so much real polit by mr  palmer himself  as  join to the veri great amend of his manner toward them sinc her sister had been known to be unhappi  induc her to accept it with pleasur  when she told mariann what she had done  howev  her first repli was not veri auspici   cleveland  she cri  with great agit   no  i cannot go to cleveland   you forget  said elinor gentl   that it situat is not  that it is not in the neighbourhood of   but it is in somersetshir  i cannot go into somersetshir  there  where i look forward to go  no  elinor  you cannot expect me to go there  elinor would not argu upon the proprieti of overcom such feel  she onli endeavour to counteract them by work on other  repres it  therefor  as a measur which would fix the time of her return to that dear mother  whom she so much wish to see  in a more elig  more comfort manner  than ani other plan could do  and perhap without ani greater delay  from cleveland  which was within a few mile of bristol  the distanc to barton was not beyond one day  though a long day  s journey  and their mother  s servant might easili come there to attend them down  and as there could be no occas of their stay abov a week at cleveland  they might now be at home in littl more than three week  time  as mariann  s affect for her mother was sincer  it must triumph with littl difficulti  over the imaginari evil she had start  mrs  jen was so far from be weari of her guest  that she press them veri earnest to return with her again from cleveland  elinor was grate for the attent  but it could not alter her design  and their mother  s concurr be readili gain  everi thing relat to their return was arrang as far as it could be  and mariann found some relief in draw up a statement of the hour that were yet to divid her from barton   ah  colonel  i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwood  was mrs  jen  s address to him when he first call on her  after their leav her was settl  for they are quit resolv upon go home from the palmer  and how forlorn we shall be  when i come back  lord  we shall sit and gape at one anoth as dull as two cat  perhap mrs  jen was in hope  by this vigor sketch of their futur ennui  to provok him to make that offer  which might give himself an escap from it  and if so  she had soon afterward good reason to think her object gain  for  on elinor  s move to the window to take more expediti the dimens of a print  which she was go to copi for her friend  he follow her to it with a look of particular mean  and convers with her there for sever minut  the effect of his discours on the ladi too  could not escap her observ  for though she was too honor to listen  and had even chang her seat  on purpos that she might not hear  to one close by the piano fort on which mariann was play  she could not keep herself from see that elinor chang colour  attend with agit  and was too intent on what he said to pursu her employ  still farther in confirm of her hope  in the interv of mariann  s turn from one lesson to anoth  some word of the colonel  s inevit reach her ear  in which he seem to be apologis for the bad of his hous  this set the matter beyond a doubt  she wonder  inde  at his think it necessari to do so  but suppos it to be the proper etiquett  what elinor said in repli she could not distinguish  but judg from the motion of her lip  that she did not think that ani materi object  and mrs  jen commend her in her heart for be so honest  they then talk on for a few minut longer without her catch a syllabl  when anoth lucki stop in mariann  s perform brought her these word in the colonel  s calm voic   i am afraid it cannot take place veri soon  astonish and shock at so unlov  like a speech  she was almost readi to cri out   lord  what should hinder it  but check her desir  confin herself to this silent ejacul   this is veri strang  sure he need not wait to be older  this delay on the colonel  s side  howev  did not seem to offend or mortifi his fair companion in the least  for on their break up the confer soon afterward  and move differ way  mrs  jen veri plain heard elinor say  and with a voic which shew her to feel what she said   i shall alway think myself veri much oblig to you  mrs  jen was delight with her gratitud  and onli wonder that after hear such a sentenc  the colonel should be abl to take leav of them  as he immedi did  with the utmost sang  froid  and go away without make her ani repli  she had not thought her old friend could have made so indiffer a suitor  what had realli pass between them was to this effect   i have heard  said he  with great compass   of the injustic your friend mr  ferrar has suffer from his famili  for if i understand the matter right  he has been entir cast off by them for persev in his engag with a veri deserv young woman  have i been right inform  is it so  elinor told him that it was   the cruelti  the impolit cruelti  he repli  with great feel  of divid  or attempt to divid  two young peopl long attach to each other  is terribl  mrs  ferrar doe not know what she may be do  what she may drive her son to  i have seen mr  ferrar two or three time in harley street  and am much pleas with him  he is not a young man with whom one can be intim acquaint in a short time  but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake  and as a friend of your  i wish it still more  i understand that he intend to take order  will you be so good as to tell him that the live of delaford  now just vacant  as i am inform by this day  s post  is his  if he think it worth his accept  but that  perhap  so unfortun circumstanc as he is now  it may be nonsens to appear to doubt  i onli wish it were more valuabl  it is a rectori  but a small one  the late incumb  i believ  did not make more than 200 l per annum  and though it is certain capabl of improv  i fear  not to such an amount as to afford him a veri comfort incom  such as it is  howev  my pleasur in present him to it  will be veri great  pray assur him of it  elinor  s astonish at this commiss could hard have been greater  had the colonel been realli make her an offer of his hand  the prefer  which onli two day befor she had consid as hopeless for edward  was alreadi provid to enabl him to marri  and she  of all peopl in the world  was fix on to bestow it  her emot was such as mrs  jen had attribut to a veri differ caus  but whatev minor feel less pure  less pleas  might have a share in that emot  her esteem for the general benevol  and her gratitud for the particular friendship  which togeth prompt colonel brandon to this act  were strong felt  and warm express  she thank him for it with all her heart  spoke of edward  s principl and disposit with that prais which she knew them to deserv  and promis to undertak the commiss with pleasur  if it were realli his wish to put off so agreeabl an offic to anoth  but at the same time  she could not help think that no one could so well perform it as himself  it was an offic in short  from which  unwil to give edward the pain of receiv an oblig from her  she would have been veri glad to be spare herself  but colonel brandon  on motiv of equal delicaci  declin it likewis  still seem so desir of it be given through her mean  that she would not on ani account make farther opposit  edward  she believ  was still in town  and fortun she had heard his address from miss steel  she could undertak therefor to inform him of it  in the cours of the day  after this had been settl  colonel brandon began to talk of his own advantag in secur so respect and agreeabl a neighbour  and then it was that he mention with regret  that the hous was small and indiffer  an evil which elinor  as mrs  jen had suppos her to do  made veri light of  at least as far as regard it size   the small of the hous  said she   i cannot imagin ani inconveni to them  for it will be in proport to their famili and incom  by which the colonel was surpris to find that she was consid mr  ferrar  s marriag as the certain consequ of the present  for he did not suppos it possibl that delaford live could suppli such an incom  as anybodi in his style of life would ventur to settl on  and he said so   this littl rectori can do no more than make mr  ferrar comfort as a bachelor  it cannot enabl him to marri  i am sorri to say that my patronag end with this  and my interest is hard more extens  if  howev  by an unforeseen chanc it should be in my power to serv him farther  i must think veri differ of him from what i now do  if i am not as readi to be use to him then as i sincer wish i could be at present  what i am now do inde  seem noth at all  sinc it can advanc him so littl toward what must be his princip  his onli object of happi  his marriag must still be a distant good  at least  i am afraid it cannot take place veri soon  such was the sentenc which  when misunderstood  so just offend the delic feel of mrs  jen  but after this narrat of what realli pass between colonel brandon and elinor  while they stood at the window  the gratitud express by the latter on their part  may perhap appear in general  not less reason excit  nor less proper word than if it had arisen from an offer of marriag  chapter 40  well  miss dashwood  said mrs  jen  sagaci smile  as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn   i do not ask you what the colonel has been say to you  for though  upon my honour  i tri to keep out of hear  i could not help catch enough to understand his busi  and i assur you i never was better pleas in my life  and i wish you joy of it with all my heart   thank you  ma  am  said elinor   it is a matter of great joy to me  and i feel the good of colonel brandon most sensibl  there are not mani men who would act as he has done  few peopl who have so compassion a heart  i never was more astonish in my life   lord  my dear  you are veri modest  i an  t the least astonish at it in the world  for i have often thought of late  there was noth more like to happen   you judg from your knowledg of the colonel  s general benevol  but at least you could not forese that the opportun would so veri soon occur   opportun  repeat mrs  jen  oh  as to that  when a man has onc made up his mind to such a thing  somehow or other he will soon find an opportun  well  my dear  i wish you joy of it again and again  and if ever there was a happi coupl in the world  i think i shall soon know where to look for them   you mean to go to delaford after them i suppos  said elinor  with a faint smile   aye  my dear  that i do  inde  and as to the hous be a bad one  i do not know what the colonel would be at  for it is as good a one as ever i saw   he spoke of it be out of repair   well  and whose fault is that  whi don  t he repair it  who should do it but himself  they were interrupt by the servant  s come in to announc the carriag be at the door  and mrs  jen immedi prepar to go  said   well  my dear  i must be gone befor i have had half my talk out  but  howev  we may have it all over in the even  for we shall be quit alon  i do not ask you to go with me  for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for compani  and besid  you must long to tell your sister all about it  mariann had left the room befor the convers began   certain  ma  am  i shall tell mariann of it  but i shall not mention it at present to ani bodi els   oh  veri well  said mrs  jen rather disappoint   then you would not have me tell it to luci  for i think of go as far as holborn to  day   no  ma  am  not even luci if you pleas  one day  s delay will not be veri materi  and till i have written to mr  ferrar  i think it ought not to be mention to ani bodi els  i shall do that direct  it is of import that no time should be lost with him  for he will of cours have much to do relat to his ordin  this speech at first puzzl mrs  jen exceed  whi mr  ferrar was to have been written to about it in such a hurri  she could not immedi comprehend  a few moment  reflect  howev  produc a veri happi idea  and she exclaim   oh  ho  i understand you  mr  ferrar is to be the man  well  so much the better for him  ay  to be sure  he must be ordain in readi  and i am veri glad to find thing are so forward between you  but  my dear  is not this rather out of charact  should not the colonel write himself  sure  he is the proper person  elinor did not quit understand the begin of mrs  jen  s speech  neither did she think it worth inquir into  and therefor onli repli to it conclus   colonel brandon is so delic a man  that he rather wish ani one to announc his intent to mr  ferrar than himself   and so you are forc to do it  well that is an odd kind of delicaci  howev  i will not disturb you  see her prepar to write  you know your own concern best  so goodbi  my dear  i have not heard of ani thing to pleas me so well sinc charlott was brought to bed  and away she went  but return again in a moment   i have just been think of betti  s sister  my dear  i should be veri glad to get her so good a mistress  but whether she would do for a ladi  s maid  i am sure i can  t tell  she is an excel housemaid  and work veri well at her needl  howev  you will think of all that at your leisur   certain  ma  am  repli elinor  not hear much of what she said  and more anxious to be alon  than to be mistress of the subject  how she should begin  how she should express herself in her note to edward  was now all her concern  the particular circumst between them made a difficulti of that which to ani other person would have been the easiest thing in the world  but she equal fear to say too much or too littl  and sat deliber over her paper  with the pen in her band  till broken in on by the entranc of edward himself  he had met mrs  jen at the door in her way to the carriag  as he came to leav his farewel card  and she  after apologis for not return herself  had oblig him to enter  by say that miss dashwood was abov  and want to speak with him on veri particular busi  elinor had just been congratul herself  in the midst of her perplex  that howev difficult it might be to express herself proper by letter  it was at least prefer to give the inform by word of mouth  when her visitor enter  to forc her upon this greatest exert of all  her astonish and confus were veri great on his so sudden appear  she had not seen him befor sinc his engag becam public  and therefor not sinc his know her to be acquaint with it  which  with the conscious of what she had been think of  and what she had to tell him  made her feel particular uncomfort for some minut  he too was much distress  and they sat down togeth in a most promis state of embarrass  whether he had ask her pardon for his intrus on first come into the room  he could not recollect  but determin to be on the safe side  he made his apolog in form as soon as he could say ani thing  after take a chair   mrs  jen told me  said he   that you wish to speak with me  at least i understood her so  or i certain should not have intrud on you in such a manner  though at the same time  i should have been extrem sorri to leav london without see you and your sister  especi as it will most like be some time  it is not probabl that i should soon have the pleasur of meet you again  i go to oxford tomorrow   you would not have gone  howev  said elinor  recov herself  and determin to get over what she so much dread as soon as possibl   without receiv our good wish  even if we had not been abl to give them in person  mrs  jen was quit right in what she said  i have someth of consequ to inform you of  which i was on the point of communic by paper  i am charg with a most agreeabl offic  breath rather faster than usual as she spoke  colonel brandon  who was here onli ten minut ago  has desir me to say  that understand you mean to take order  he has great pleasur in offer you the live of delaford now just vacant  and onli wish it were more valuabl  allow me to congratul you on have so respect and well  judg a friend  and to join in his wish that the live  it is about two hundr a  year  were much more consider  and such as might better enabl you to  as might be more than a temporari accommod to yourself  such  in short  as might establish all your view of happi  what edward felt  as he could not say it himself  it cannot be expect that ani one els should say for him  he look all the astonish which such unexpect  such unthought  of inform could not fail of excit  but he said onli these two word   colonel brandon   yes  continu elinor  gather more resolut  as some of the worst was over   colonel brandon mean it as a testimoni of his concern for what has late pass  for the cruel situat in which the unjustifi conduct of your famili has place you  a concern which i am sure mariann  myself  and all your friend  must share  and likewis as a proof of his high esteem for your general charact  and his particular approb of your behaviour on the present occas   colonel brandon give me a live  can it be possibl   the unkind of your own relat has made you astonish to find friendship ani where   no  repli be  with sudden conscious   not to find it in you  for i cannot be ignor that to you  to your good  i owe it all  i feel it  i would express it if i could  but  as you well know  i am no orat   you are veri much mistaken  i do assur you that you owe it entir  at least almost entir  to your own merit  and colonel brandon  s discern of it  i have had no hand in it  i did not even know  till i understood his design  that the live was vacant  nor had it ever occur to me that he might have had such a live in his gift  as a friend of mine  of my famili  he may  perhap  inde i know he has  still greater pleasur in bestow it  but  upon my word  you owe noth to my solicit  truth oblig her to acknowledg some small share in the action  but she was at the same time so unwil to appear as the benefactress of edward  that she acknowledg it with hesit  which probabl contribut to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recent enter it  for a short time he sat deep in thought  after elinor had ceas to speak  at last  and as if it were rather an effort  he said   colonel brandon seem a man of great worth and respect  i have alway heard him spoken of as such  and your brother i know esteem him high  he is undoubt a sensibl man  and in his manner perfect the gentleman   inde  repli elinor   i believ that you will find him  on farther acquaint  all that you have heard him to be  and as you will be such veri near neighbour  for i understand the parsonag is almost close to the mansion  hous  it is particular import that he should be all this  edward made no answer  but when she had turn away her head  gave her a look so serious  so earnest  so uncheer  as seem to say  that he might hereaft wish the distanc between the parsonag and the mansion  hous much greater   colonel brandon  i think  lodg in st  jame street  said he  soon afterward  rise from his chair  elinor told him the number of the hous   i must hurri away then  to give him those thank which you will not allow me to give you  to assur him that he has made me a veri  an exceed happi man  elinor did not offer to detain him  and they part  with a veri earnest assur on her side of her unceas good wish for his happi in everi chang of situat that might befal him  on his  with rather an attempt to return the same good will  than the power of express it   when i see him again  said elinor to herself  as the door shut him out   i shall see him the husband of luci  and with this pleas anticip  she sat down to reconsid the past  recal the word and endeavour to comprehend all the feel of edward  and  of cours  to reflect on her own with discont  when mrs  jen came home  though she return from see peopl whom she had never seen befor  and of whom therefor she must have a great deal to say  her mind was so much more occupi by the import secret in her possess  than by anyth els  that she revert to it again as soon as elinor appear   well  my dear  she cri

hous that to my knowledg has five sit room on the ground  floor  and i think the housekeep told me could make up fifteen bed  and to you too  that had been use to live in barton cottag  it seem quit ridicul  but  my dear  we must touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonag  and make it comfort for them  befor luci goe to it   but colonel brandon doe not seem to have ani idea of the live  s be enough to allow them to marri   the colonel is a ninni  my dear  becaus he has two thousand a  year himself  he think that nobodi els can marri on less  take my word for it  that  if i am aliv  i shall be pay a visit at delaford parsonag befor michaelma  and i am sure i sha  nt go if luci an  t there  elinor was quit of her opinion  as to the probabl of their not wait for ani thing more  chapter 41 edward  have carri his thank to colonel brandon  proceed with his happi to luci  and such was the excess of it by the time he reach bartlett  s build  that she was abl to assur mrs  jen  who call on her again the next day with her congratul  that she had never seen him in such spirit befor in her life  her own happi  and her own spirit  were at least veri certain  and she join mrs

give her  that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grate warmth  was readi to own all their oblig to her  and open declar that no exert for their good on miss dashwood  s part  either present or futur  would ever surpris her  for she believ her capabl of do ani thing in the world for those she realli valu  as for colonel brandon  she was not onli readi to worship him as a

she possibl could  of his servant  his carriag  his cow  and his poultri  it was now abov a week sinc john dashwood had call in berkeley street  and as sinc that time no notic had been taken by them of his wife  s indisposit  beyond one verbal enquiri  elinor began to feel it necessari to pay her a visit  this was an oblig  howev  which not onli oppos her own inclin  but which had not the assist of ani encourag from her companion  mariann  not content with absolut refus to go herself  was veri urgent to prevent her sister  s go at all  and mrs  jen  though her carriag was alway at elinor  s servic  so veri much dislik mrs  john dashwood  that not even her curios to see how she look after the late discoveri  nor her strong desir to affront her by take edward  s part  could overcom her unwilling to be in her compani again  the consequ was  that elinor set out by herself to pay a visit  for which no one could realli have less inclin  and to run the risk of a tete  a  tete with a woman  whom neither of the other had so much reason to dislik  mrs  dashwood was deni  but befor the carriag could turn from the hous  her husband accident came out  he express great pleasur in meet elinor  told her that he had been just go to call in berkeley street  and  assur her that fanni would be veri glad to see her  invit her to come in  they walk up stair in to the draw  room  nobodi was there   fanni is in her own room  i suppos  said he  i will go to her present  for i am sure she will not have the least object in the world to see you  veri far from it  inde  now especi there cannot be  but howev  you and mariann were alway great favourit  whi would not mariann come  elinor made what excus she could for her   i am not sorri to see you alon  he repli   for i have a good deal to say to you  this live of colonel brandon  s  can it be true  has he realli given it to edward  i heard it yesterday by chanc  and was come to you on purpos to enquir farther about it   it is perfect true  colonel brandon has given the live of delaford to edward   realli  well  this is veri astonish  no relationship  no connect between them  and now that live fetch such a price  what was the valu of this   about two hundr a year   veri well  and for the next present to a live of that valu  suppos the late incumb to have been old and sick  and like to vacat it soon  he might have got i dare say  fourteen hundr pound  and how came he not to have settl that matter befor this person  s death  now inde it would be too late to sell it  but a man of colonel brandon  s sens  i wonder he should be so improvid in a point of such common  such natur  concern  well  i am convinc that there is a vast deal of inconsist in almost everi human charact  i suppos  howev  on recollect  that the case may probabl be this  edward is onli to hold the live till the person to whom the colonel has realli sold the present  is old enough to take it  aye  aye  that is the fact  depend upon it  elinor contradict it  howev  veri posit  and by relat that she had herself been employ in convey the offer from colonel brandon to edward  and  therefor  must understand the term on which it was given  oblig him to submit to her author   it is truli astonish  he cri  after hear what she said  what could be the colonel  s motiv   a veri simpl one  to be of use to mr  ferrar   well  well  whatev colonel brandon may be  edward is a veri lucki man  you will not mention the matter to fanni  howev  for though i have broke it to her  and she bear it vast well  she will not like to hear it much talk of  elinor had some difficulti here to refrain from observ  that she thought fanni might have born with composur  an acquisit of wealth to her brother  by which neither she nor her child could be possibl impoverish   mrs  ferrar  ad he  lower his voic to the tone becom so import a subject   know noth about it at present  and i believ it will be best to keep it entir conceal from her as long as may be  when the marriag take place  i fear she must hear of it all   but whi should such precaut be use  though it is not to be suppos that mrs  ferrar can have the smallest satisfact in know that her son has money enough to live upon  for that must be quit out of the question  yet whi  upon her late behaviour  is she suppos to feel at all  she has done with her son  she cast him off for ever  and has made all those over whom she had ani influenc  cast him off likewis  sure  after do so  she cannot be imagin liabl to ani impress of sorrow or of joy on his account  she cannot be interest in ani thing that befal him  she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child  and yet retain the anxieti of a parent   ah  elinor  said john   your reason is veri good  but it is found on ignor of human natur  when edward  s unhappi match take place  depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discard him  and  therefor everi circumst that may acceler that dread event  must be conceal from her as much as possibl  mrs  ferrar can never forget that edward is her son   you surpris me  i should think it must near have escap her memori by this time   you wrong her exceed  mrs  ferrar is one of the most affection mother in the world  elinor was silent   we think now  said mr  dashwood  after a short paus   of robert  s marri miss morton  elinor  smile at the grave and decis import of her brother  s tone  calm repli   the ladi  i suppos  has no choic in the affair   choic  how do you mean   i onli mean that i suppos  from your manner of speak  it must be the same to miss morton whether she marri edward or robert   certain  there can be no differ  for robert will now to all intent and purpos be consid as the eldest son  and as to ani thing els  they are both veri agreeabl young men  i do not know that one is superior to the other  elinor said no more  and john was also for a short time silent  his reflect end thus   of one thing  my dear sister  kind take her hand  and speak in an aw whisper  i may assur you  and i will do it  becaus i know it must gratifi you  i have good reason to think  inde i have it from the best author  or i should not repeat it  for otherwis it would be veri wrong to say ani thing about it  but i have it from the veri best author  not that i ever precis heard mrs  ferrar say it herself  but her daughter did  and i have it from her  that in short  whatev object there might be against a certain  a certain connect  you understand me  it would have been far prefer to her  it would not have given her half the vexat that this doe  i was exceed pleas to hear that mrs  ferrar consid it in that light  a veri gratifi circumst you know to us all   it would have been beyond comparison  she said   the least evil of the two  and she would be glad to compound now for noth wors  but howev  all that is quit out of the question  not to be thought of or mention  as to ani attach you know  it never could be  all that is gone by  but i thought i would just tell you of this  becaus i knew how much it must pleas you  not that you have ani reason to regret  my dear elinor  there is no doubt of your do exceed well  quit as well  or better  perhap  all thing consid  has colonel brandon been with you late  elinor had heard enough  if not to gratifi her vaniti  and rais her self  import  to agit her nerv and fill her mind  and she was therefor glad to be spare from the necess of say much in repli herself  and from the danger of hear ani thing more from her brother  by the entranc of mr  robert ferrar  after a few moment  chat  john dashwood  recollect that fanni was yet uninform of her sister  s be there  quit the room in quest of her  and elinor was left to improv her acquaint with robert  who  by the gay unconcern  the happi self  complac of his manner while enjoy so unfair a divis of his mother  s love and liber  to the prejudic of his banish brother  earn onli by his own dissip cours of life  and that brother  s integr  was confirm her most unfavour opinion of his head and heart  they had scarc been two minut by themselv  befor he began to speak of edward  for he  too  had heard of the live  and was veri inquisit on the subject  elinor repeat the particular of it  as she had given them to john  and their effect on robert  though veri differ  was not less strike than it had been on him  he laugh most immoder  the idea of edward  s be a clergyman  and live in a small parsonag  hous  divert him beyond measur  and when to that was ad the fanci imageri of edward read prayer in a white surplic  and publish the bann of marriag between john smith and mari brown  he could conceiv noth more ridicul  elinor  while she wait in silenc and immov graviti  the conclus of such folli  could not restrain her eye from be fix on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excit  it was a look  howev  veri well bestow  for it reliev her own feel  and gave no intellig to him  he was recal from wit to wisdom  not by ani reproof of her  s  but by his own sensibl   we may treat it as a joke  said he  at last  recov from the affect laugh which had consider lengthen out the genuin gaieti of the moment  but  upon my soul  it is a most serious busi  poor edward  he is ruin for ever  i am extrem sorri for it  for i know him to be a veri good  heart creatur  as well  mean a fellow perhap  as ani in the world  you must not judg of him  miss dashwood  from your slight acquaint  poor edward  his manner are certain not the happiest in natur  but we are not all born  you know  with the same power  the same address  poor fellow  to see him in a circl of stranger  to be sure it was pitiabl enough  but upon my soul  i believ he has as good a heart as ani in the kingdom  and i declar and protest to you i never was so shock in my life  as when it all burst forth  i could not believ it  my mother was the first person who told me of it  and i  feel myself call on to act with resolut  immedi said to her   my dear madam  i do not know what you may intend to do on the occas  but as for myself  i must say  that if edward doe marri this young woman  i never will see him again  that was what i said immedi  i was most uncommon shock  inde  poor edward  he has done for himself complet  shut himself out for ever from all decent societi  but  as i direct said to my mother  i am not in the least surpris at it  from his style of educ  it was alway to be expect  my poor mother was half frantic   have you ever seen the ladi   yes  onc  while she was stay in this hous  i happen to drop in for ten

edward  i offer immedi  as soon as my mother relat the affair to me  to talk to him myself  and dissuad him from the match  but it was too late then  i found  to do ani thing  for unluckili  i was not in the way at first  and knew noth of it till after the breach had taken place  when it was not for me  you know  to interfer  but had i been inform of it a few hour earlier  i think it is most probabl  that someth might have been hit on  i certain should have repres it to edward in a veri strong light   my dear fellow  i should have said   consid what you are do  you are make a most disgrac connect  and such a one as your famili are unanim in disapprov  i cannot help think  in short  that mean might have been found  but now it is all too late  he must be starv  you know  that is certain  absolut starv  he had just settl this point with great composur  when the entranc of mrs  john dashwood put an end to the subject  but though she never spoke of it out of her own famili  elinor could see it influenc on her mind  in the someth like confus of counten with which she enter  and an attempt at cordial in her behaviour to herself  she even proceed so far as to be concern to find that

what she was  that my heart should have been so insens  but at first i must confess  my vaniti onli was elev by it  careless of her happi  think onli of my own amus  give way to feel which i had alway been too much in the habit of indulg  i endeavour  by everi mean in my power  to make myself pleas to her  without ani design of return her affect  miss dashwood  at this point  turn her eye on him with the most angri contempt  stop him  by say   it is hard worth while  mr  willoughbi  for you to relat  or for me to listen ani longer  such a begin as this cannot be follow by ani thing  do not let me be pain by hear ani thing more on the subject   i insist on you hear the whole of it  he repli   my fortun was never larg  and i had alway been expens  alway in the habit of associ with peopl of better incom than myself  everi year sinc my come of age  or even befor  i believ  had ad to my debt  and though the death of my old cousin  mrs  smith  was to set me free  yet that event be uncertain  and possibl far distant  it had been for some time my intent to re  establish my circumst by marri a woman of fortun  to attach myself to your sister  therefor  was not a thing to be thought of  and with a mean  selfish  cruelti  which no indign  no contemptu look  even of your  miss dashwood  can ever reprob too much  i was act in this manner  tri to engag her regard  without a thought of return it  but one thing may be said for me  even in that horrid state of selfish vaniti  i did not know the extent of the injuri i medit  becaus i did not then know what it was to love  but have i ever known it  well may it be doubt  for  had i realli love  could i have sacrif my feel to vaniti  to avaric  or  what is more  could i have sacrif her  but i have done it  to avoid a compar poverti  which her affect and her societi would have depriv of all it horror  i have  by rais myself to affluenc  lost everi thing that could make it a bless   you did then  said elinor  a littl soften   believ yourself at one time attach to her   to have resist such attract  to have withstood such tender  is there a man on earth who could have done it  yes  i found myself  by insens degre  sincer fond of her  and the happiest hour of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intent were strict honour  and my feel blameless  even then  howev  when fulli determin on pay my address to her  i allow myself most improp to put off  from day to day  the moment of do it  from an unwilling to enter into an engag while my circumst were so great embarrass  i will not reason here  nor will i stop for you to expati on the absurd  and the wors than absurd  of scrupl to engag my faith where my honour was alreadi bound  the event has prove  that i was a cun fool  provid with great circumspect for a possibl opportun of make myself contempt and wretch for ever  at last  howev  my resolut was taken  and i had determin  as soon as i could engag her alon  to justifi the attent i had so invari paid her  and open assur her of an affect which i had alreadi taken such pain to display  but in the interim  in the interim of the veri few hour that were to pass  befor i could have an

an heighten colour and an enquir eye  your particular intimaci  you have probabl heard the whole stori long ago   i have  return elinor  colour likewis  and harden her heart anew against ani compass for him   i have heard it all  and how you will explain away ani part of your guilt in that dread busi  i confess is beyond my comprehens   rememb  cri willoughbi   from whom you receiv the account  could it be an imparti one  i acknowledg that her situat and her charact ought to have been respect by me  i do not mean to justifi myself  but at the same time cannot leav you to suppos that i have noth to urg  that becaus she was injur she was irreproach  and becaus i was a libertin  she must be a saint  if the violenc of her passion  the weak of her understand  i do not mean  howev  to defend myself  her affect for me deserv better treatment  and i often  with great self  reproach  recal the tender which  for a veri short time  had the power of creat ani return  i wish  i heartili wish it had never been  but i have injur more than herself  and i have injur one  whose affect for me  may i say it  was scarc less warm than her  and whose mind  oh  how infinit superior   your indiffer  howev  toward that unfortun girl  i must say it  unpleas to me as the discuss of such a subject may well be  your indiffer is no apolog for your cruel neglect of her  do not think yourself excus by ani weak  ani natur defect of understand on her side  in the wanton cruelti so evid on your  you must have known  that while you were enjoy yourself in devonshir pursu fresh scheme  alway gay  alway happi  she was reduc to the extremest indig   but  upon my soul  i did not know it  he warm repli   i did not recollect that i had omit to give her my direct  and common sens might have told her how

discont with the veri littl attent  the veri littl portion of my time that i had bestow on her  in my present visit  in short  it end in a total breach  by one measur i might have save myself  in the height of her moral  good woman  she offer to forgiv the past  if i would marri eliza  that could not be  and i was formal dismiss from her favour and her hous  the night follow this affair  i was to go the next morn  was spent by me in deliber on what my futur conduct should be  the struggl was great  but it end too soon  my affect for mariann  my thorough convict of her attach to me  it was all insuffici to outweigh that dread of poverti  or get the better of those fals idea of the necess of rich  which i was natur inclin to feel  and expens societi had increas  i had reason to believ myself secur of my present wife  if i chose to address her  and i persuad myself to think that noth els in common prudenc remain for me to do  a heavi scene howev await me  befor i could leav devonshir  i was engag to dine with you on that veri day  some apolog was therefor necessari for my break this engag  but whether i should write this apolog  or deliv it in person  was a point of long debat  to see mariann  i felt  would be dread  and i even doubt whether i could see her again  and keep to my resolut  in that point  howev  i undervalu my own magnanim  as the event declar  for i went  i saw her  and saw her miser  and left her miser  and left her hope never to see her again   whi did you call  mr  willoughbi  said elinor  reproach   a note would have answer everi purpos  whi was it necessari to call   it was necessari to my own pride  i could not bear to leav the countri in a manner that might lead you  or the rest of the neighbourhood  to suspect ani part of what had realli pass between mrs  smith and myself  and i resolv therefor on call at the cottag  in my way to honiton  the sight of your dear sister  howev  was realli dread  and  to heighten the matter  i found her alon  you were all gone i do not know where  i had left her onli the even befor  so fulli  so firm resolv within my self on do right  a few hour were to have engag her to me for ever  and i rememb how happi  how gay were my spirit  as i walk from the cottag to allenham  satisfi with myself  delight with everi bodi  but in this  our last interview of friendship  i approach her with a sens of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembl  her sorrow  her disappoint  her deep regret  when i told her that i was oblig to leav devonshir so immedi  i never shall forget it  unit too with such

told her  he repli  impati   less than was due to the past  beyond a doubt  and in all likelihood much more than was justifi by the futur  i cannot think of it  it won  t do  then came your dear mother to tortur me farther  with all her kind and confid  thank heaven  it did tortur me  i was miser  miss dashwood  you cannot have an idea of the comfort it give me to look back on my own miseri  i owe such a grudg to myself for the stupid  rascal folli of my own heart  that all my past suffer under it are onli triumph and exult to me now  well  i went  left all that i love  and went to those

with him of the two  elinor was half inclin to ask her reason for think so  becaus satisfi that none found on an imparti consider of their age  charact  or feel  could be given  but her mother must alway be carri away by her imagin on ani interest subject  and therefor instead of an inquiri  she pass it off with a smile   he open his whole heart to me yesterday as we travel  it came out quit

now goe  would not justifi so warm a sympathi  or rather  not think at all  i suppos  give way to irresist feel  made me acquaint with his earnest  tender  constant  affect for mariann  he has love her  my elinor  ever sinc the first moment of see her  here  howev  elinor perceiv  not the languag  not the profess of colonel brandon  but the natur embellish of her mother  s activ fanci  which fashion everi thing delight to her as it chose   his regard for her  infinit surpass anyth that willoughbi ever felt or feign  as much more warm  as more sincer or constant  which ever we are to call it  has subsist through all the knowledg of dear mariann  s unhappi prepossess for that worthless young man  and without selfish  without encourag a hope  could he have seen her happi with anoth  such a nobl mind  such open  such sincer  no one can be deceiv in him   colonel brandon  s charact  said elinor   as an excel man  is well establish   i know it is  repli her mother serious   or after such a warn  i should be the last to encourag such affect  or even to be pleas by it  but his come for me as he did  with such activ  such readi friendship  is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men   his charact  howev  answer elinor   doe not rest on one act of kind  to which his affect for mariann  were human out of the case  would have prompt him  to mrs  jen  to the middleton  he has been long and intim known  they equal love and respect him  and even my own knowledg of him  though late acquir  is veri consider  and so high do i valu and esteem him  that if mariann can be happi with him  i shall be as readi as yourself to think our connect the greatest bless to us in the world  what answer did you give him  did you allow him to hope   oh  my love  i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself  mariann might at that moment be die  but he did not ask for hope or encourag  his was an involuntari confid  an irrepress effus to a sooth friend  not an applic to a parent  yet after a time i did say  for at first i was quit overcom  that if she live  as i trust she might  my greatest happi would lie in promot their marriag  and sinc our arriv  sinc our delight secur  i have repeat it to him more fulli  have given him everi encourag in my power  time  a veri littl time  i tell him  will do everyth  mariann  s heart is not to be wast for ever on such a man as willoughbi  his own merit must soon secur it   to judg from the colonel  s spirit  howev  you have not yet made him equal sanguin   no  he think mariann  s affect too deepli root for ani chang in it under a great length of time  and even suppos her heart again free  is too diffid of himself to believ  that with such a differ of age and disposit he could ever attach her  there  howev  he is quit mistaken  his age is onli so much beyond her as to be an advantag  as to make his charact and principl fix  and his disposit  i am well convinc  is exact the veri one to make your sister happi  and his person  his manner too  are all in his favour  my partial doe not blind me  he certain is not so handsom as willoughbi  but at the same time  there is someth much more pleas in his counten  there was alway a someth  if you rememb  in willoughbi  s eye at time  which i did not like  elinor could not rememb it  but her mother  without wait for her assent  continu   and his manner  the colonel  s manner are not onli more pleas to me than willoughbi  s ever were  but they are of a kind i well know to be more solid attach to mariann  their gentl  their genuin attent to other peopl  and their man unstudi simplic is much more accord with her real disposit  than the liveli  often artifici  and often ill  time of the other  i am veri sure myself  that had willoughbi turn out as realli amiabl  as he has prove himself the contrari  mariann would yet never have been so happi with him  as she will be with colonel brandon  she paus  her daughter could not quit agre with her  but her dissent was not heard  and therefor gave no offenc   at delaford  she will be within an easi distanc of me  ad mrs  dashwood   even if i remain at barton  and in all probabl  for i hear it is a larg villag  inde there certain must be some small hous or cottag close by  that would suit us quit as well as our present situat  poor elinor  here was a new scheme for get her to delaford  but her spirit was stubborn   his fortun too  for at my time of life you know  everybodi care about that  and though i neither know nor desir to know  what it realli is  i am sure it must be a good one  here they were interrupt

selfish  in a tone that impli  do you realli think him selfish   the whole of his behaviour  repli elinor   from the begin to the end of the affair  has been ground on selfish  it was selfish which first made him sport with your affect  which afterward  when his own were engag  made him delay the confess of it  and which final carri him from barton  his own enjoy  or his own eas  was  in everi

toward himself  it has not made him happi  his circumst are now unembarrass  he suffer from no evil of that kind  and he think onli that he has marri a woman of a less amiabl temper than yourself  but doe it follow that had he marri you  he would have been happi  the inconveni would have been differ  he would then have suffer under the pecuniari distress which  becaus they are remov  he now reckon as noth  he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint  but he would have been alway necessit  alway poor  and probabl would soon have learn to rank the innumer comfort of a

rather say your mother  s imprud  my child  said mrs  dashwood   she must be answer  mariann would not let her proceed  and elinor  satisfi that each felt their own error  wish to avoid ani survey of

mariann was rather better  and her mother leav her to the care of margaret and the maid  return to elinor  who  though still much disord  had so far recov the use of her reason and voic as to be just

veri well off  that with so much uneasi as both her sister had late experienc  so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meal  she had never been oblig to go without her dinner befor  when the dessert and the wine were arrang  and mrs  dashwood and elinor were left by themselv  they remain long togeth in a similar of thought and silenc  mrs  dashwood fear to hazard ani

as possibl out of sight  to conceal her distress  and margaret  understand some part  but not the whole of the case  thought it incumb on her to be dignifi  and therefor took a seat as far from him as she could  and maintain a strict silenc  when elinor had ceas to rejoic in the dryness of the season  a veri aw paus took place  it was put an end to by mrs  dashwood  who felt oblig to hope that he

was repeat by mariann and her mother in an accent of the utmost amaz  and though elinor could not speak  even her eye were fix on him with the same impati wonder  he rose from his seat  and walk to

perhap saw  or even heard  her emot  for immedi afterward he fell into a reveri  which no remark  no inquiri  no affection address of mrs  dashwood could penetr  and at last  without say a word  quit the room  and walk out toward the villag  leav the other in the greatest astonish and perplex on a chang in his situat  so wonder and so sudden  a perplex which they had no mean of lessen but by their own conjectur  chapter 49 unaccount  howev  as the circumst of his releas might appear to the whole famili  it was certain that edward was free  and to what purpos that freedom would be employ was easili pre  determin by all  for after experienc the bless of one imprud engag  contract without his mother  s consent  as he had alreadi done for more than four year  noth less could be expect of him in the failur of that  than the immedi contract of anoth  his errand at barton  in fact  was a simpl one  it was onli to ask elinor to marri him  and consid that he was not altogeth inexperienc in such a question  it might be strang that he should feel so uncomfort in the present case as he realli did  so much in need of encourag and fresh air  how soon he had walk himself into the proper resolut  howev  how soon an opportun of exercis it occur  in what manner he express himself  and how he was receiv  need not be particular told  this onli need be said  that when they all sat down to tabl at four o  clock  about three hour after his arriv  he had secur his ladi  engag her mother  s consent  and was not onli in the raptur profess of the lover  but  in the realiti of reason and truth  one of the happiest of men  his situat inde was more than common joy  he had more than the ordinari triumph of accept love to swell his heart  and rais his spirit  he was releas without ani reproach to himself  from an entangl which had long form his miseri  from a woman whom he had long ceas to love  and elev at onc to that secur with anoth  which he must have thought of almost with despair  as soon as he had learnt to consid it with desir  he was brought  not from doubt or suspens  but from miseri to happi  and the chang was open spoken in such a genuin  flow  grate cheer  as his friend had never wit in him befor  his heart was now open to elinor  all it weak  all it error confess  and his first boyish attach to luci treat with all the philosoph digniti of twenti  four   it was a foolish  idl inclin on my side  said he   the consequ of ignor of the world  and want of employ  had my brother given me some activ profess when i was remov at eighteen from the care of mr  pratt  i think  nay  i am sure  it would never have happen  for though i left longstapl with what i thought  at the time  a most unconquer prefer for his niec  yet had i then had ani pursuit  ani object to engag my time and keep me at a distanc from her for a few month  i should veri soon have outgrown the fanci attach  especi by mix more with the world  as in such case i must have done  but instead of have ani thing to do  instead of have ani profess chosen for me  or be allow to chuse ani myself  i return home to be complet idl  and for the first twelvemonth afterward i had not even the nomin employ  which belong to the univers would have given me  for i was not enter at oxford till i was nineteen  i had therefor noth in the world to do  but to fanci myself in love  and as my mother did not make my home in everi respect comfort  as i had no friend  no companion in my brother  and dislik new acquaint  it was not unnatur for me to be veri often at longstapl  where i alway felt myself at home  and was alway sure of a welcom  and accord i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen  luci appear everyth that was amiabl and oblig  she was pretti too  at least i thought so then  and i had seen so littl of other women  that i could make no comparison  and see no defect  consid everyth  therefor  i hope  foolish as our engag was  foolish as it has sinc in everi way been prove  it was not at the time an unnatur or an inexcus piec of folli  the chang which a few hour had wrought in the mind and the happi of the dashwood  was such  so great  as promis them all  the satisfact of a sleepless night  mrs  dashwood  too happi to be comfort  knew not how to love edward  nor prais elinor enough  how to be enough thank for his releas without wound his delicaci  nor how at onc to give them leisur for unrestrain convers togeth  and yet enjoy  as she wish  the sight and societi of both  mariann could speak her happi onli by tear  comparison would occur  regret would aris  and her joy  though sincer as her love for her sister  was of a kind to give her neither spirit nor languag  but elinor  how are her feel to be describ  from the moment of learn that luci was marri to anoth  that edward was free  to the moment of his justifi the hope which had so instant follow  she was everi thing by turn but tranquil  but when the second moment had pass  when she found everi doubt  everi solicitud remov  compar her situat with what so late it had been  saw him honour releas from his former engag  saw him instant profit by the releas  to address

with ani chang for the better  it requir sever hour to give sedat to her spirit  or ani degre of tranquil to her heart  edward was now fix at the cottag at least for a week  for whatev other claim might be made on him  it was imposs that less than a week should be given up to the enjoy of elinor  s compani  or suffic to say half that was to be said of the past  the present  and the futur  for though a veri few hour spent in the hard labor of incess talk will despatch more subject than can realli be in common between ani two ration creatur  yet with lover it is differ  between them no subject is finish  no communic is even made  till it has been made at least twenti time over  luci  s marriag  the unceas and reason wonder among them all  form of cours one of the earliest discuss of the lover  and elinor  s particular knowledg of each parti made it appear to her in everi view  as one of the most extraordinari and unaccount circumst she had ever heard  how they could be thrown togeth  and by what attract robert could be drawn on to marri a girl  of whose beauti she had herself heard him speak without ani admir  a girl too alreadi engag to his brother  and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his famili  it was beyond her comprehens to make out  to her own heart it was a delight affair  to her imagin it was even a ridicul one  but to her reason  her judgment  it was complet a puzzl  edward could onli attempt an explan by suppos  that  perhap  at first accident meet  the vaniti of the one had been so work on by the flatteri of the other  as to lead by degre to all the rest  elinor rememb what robert had told her in harley street  of his opinion of what his own mediat in his brother  s affair might have done  if appli to in time  she repeat it to edward   that was exact like robert  was his immedi observ  and that  he present ad   might perhap be in his head when the acquaint between them first began  and luci perhap at first might think onli of procur his good offic in my favour  other design might afterward aris  how long it had been carri on between them  howev  he was equal at a loss with herself to make out  for at oxford  where he had remain for choic ever sinc his quit london  he had had no mean of hear of her but from herself  and her letter to the veri last were neither less frequent  nor less affection than usual  not the smallest suspicion  therefor  had ever occur to prepar him for what follow  and when at last it burst on him in a letter from luci herself  he had been for some time  he believ  half stupifi between the wonder  the horror  and the joy of such a deliver  he put the letter into elinor  s hand   dear sir   be veri sure i have long lost your affect  i have thought myself at liberti to bestow my own on anoth  and have no doubt of be as happi with him as i onc use to think i might be with you  but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was anoth  s  sincer wish you happi in your choic  and it shall not be my fault if we are not alway good friend  as our near relationship now make proper  i can safe say i owe you no ill  will  and am sure you will be too generous to do us ani ill offic  your brother has gain my affect entir  and as we could not live without one anoth  we are just return from the altar  and are now on our way to dawlish for a few week  which place your dear brother has great curios to see  but thought i would first troubl you with these few line  and shall alway remain   your sincer well  wisher  friend  and sister   luci ferrar   i have burnt all your letter  and will return your pictur the first opportun  pleas to destroy my scrawl  but the ring with my hair you are veri welcom to keep  elinor read and return it without ani comment   i will not ask your opinion of it as a composit  said edward  for world would not i have had a letter of her seen by you in former day  in a sister it is bad enough  but in a wife  how i have blush over the page of her write  and i believ i may say that sinc the first half year of our foolish  busi  this is the onli letter i ever receiv from her  of which the substanc made me ani amend for the defect of the style   howev it may have come about  said elinor  after a paus  they are certain marri  and your mother has brought on herself a most appropri punish  the independ she settl on robert  through resent against you  has put it in his power to make his own choic  and she has actual been bribe one son with a thousand a  year  to do the veri deed which she disinherit the other for intend to do  she will hard be less hurt  i suppos  by robert  s marri luci  than she would have been by your marri her   she will be more hurt by it  for robert alway was her favourit  she will be more hurt by it  and on the same principl will forgiv him much sooner  in what state the affair stood at present between them  edward knew not  for no communic with ani of his famili had yet been attempt by him  he had quit oxford within four and twenti hour after luci  s letter arriv  and with onli one object befor him  the nearest road to barton  had had no leisur to form ani scheme of conduct  with which that road did not hold the most intim connect  he could do noth till he were assur of his fate with miss dashwood  and by his rapid in seek that fate  it is to be suppos  in spite of the jealousi with which he had onc thought of colonel brandon  in spite of the modesti with which he rate his own desert  and the polit with which he talk of his doubt  he did not  upon the whole  expect a veri cruel recept  it was his busi  howev  to say that he did  and he said it veri prettili  what he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after  must be refer to the imagin of husband and wive  that luci had certain meant to deceiv  to go off with a flourish of malic against him in her messag by thoma  was perfect clear to elinor  and edward himself  now thorough enlighten on her charact  had no scrupl in believ her capabl of the utmost mean of wanton ill  natur  though his eye had been long open  even befor his acquaint with elinor began  to her ignor and a want of liber in some of her opinion  they had been equal imput  by him  to her want of educ  and till her last letter reach him  he had alway believ her to be a well  dispos  good  heart girl  and thorough attach to himself  noth but such a persuas could have prevent his put an end to an engag  which  long befor the discoveri of it laid him open to his mother  s anger  had been a continu sourc of disquiet and regret to him   i thought it my duti  said he   independ of my feel  to give her the option of continu the engag or not  when i was renounc by my mother  and stood to all appear without a friend in the world to assist me  in such a situat as that  where there seem noth to tempt the avaric or the vaniti of ani live creatur  how could i suppos  when she so earnest  so warm insist on share my fate  whatev it might be  that ani thing but the most disinterest affect was her induc  and even now  i cannot comprehend on what motiv she act  or what fanci advantag it could be to her  to be fetter to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard  and who had onli two thousand pound in the world  she could not forese that colonel brandon would give me a live   no  but she might suppos that someth would occur in your favour  that your own famili might in time relent  and at ani rate  she lost noth by continu the engag  for she has prove that it fetter neither her inclin nor her action  the connect was certain a respect one  and probabl gain her consider among her friend  and  if noth more advantag occur  it would be better for her to marri you than be singl  edward was  of cours  immedi convinc that noth could have been more natur than luci  s conduct  nor more self  evid than the motiv of it  elinor scold him  harsh as ladi alway scold the imprud which compliment themselv  for have spent so much time with them at norland  when he must have felt his own inconst   your behaviour was certain veri wrong  said she   becaus  to say noth of my own convict  our relat were all led away by it to fanci and expect what  as you were then situat  could never be  he could onli plead an ignor of his own heart  and a mistaken confid in the forc of his engag   i was simpl enough to think  that becaus my faith was plight to anoth  there could be no danger in my be with you  and that the conscious of my engag was to keep my heart as safe and sacr as my honour  i felt that i admir you  but i told myself it was onli friendship  and till i began to make comparison between yourself and luci  i did not know how far i was got  after that  i suppos  i was wrong in remain so much in sussex  and the argument with which i reconcil myself to the expedi of it  were no better than these  the danger is my own  i am do no injuri to anybodi but myself  elinor smile  and shook her head  edward heard with pleasur of colonel brandon  s be expect at the cottag  as he realli wish not onli to be better acquaint with him  but to have an opportun of convinc him that he no longer resent his give him the live of delaford  which  at present  said he   after thank so ungraci deliv as mine were on the occas  he must think i have never forgiven him for offer  now he felt astonish himself that he had never yet been to the place  but so littl interest had be taken in the matter  that he owe all his knowledg of the hous  garden  and glebe  extent of the parish  condit of the land  and rate of the tith  to elinor herself  who had heard so much of it from colonel brandon  and heard it with so much attent  as to be entir mistress of the subject  one question after this onli remain undecid  between them  one difficulti onli was to be overcom  they were brought togeth by mutual affect  with the warmest approb of their real friend  their intim knowledg of each other seem to make their happi certain  and they onli want someth to live upon  edward had two thousand pound  and elinor one  which  with delaford live  was all that they could call their own  for it was imposs that mrs  dashwood should advanc anyth  and they were neither of them quit enough in love to think that three hundr and fifti pound a  year would suppli them with the comfort of life  edward was not entir without hope of some favour chang in his mother toward him  and on that he rest for the residu of their incom  but elinor had no such depend  for sinc edward would still be unabl to marri miss morton  and his chuse herself had been spoken of in mrs  ferrar  s flatter languag as onli a lesser evil than his chuse luci steel  she fear that robert  s offenc would serv no other purpos than to enrich fanni  about four day after edward  s arriv colonel brandon appear  to complet mrs  dashwood  s satisfact  and to give her the digniti of have  for the first time sinc her live at barton  more compani with her than her hous would hold  edward was allow to retain the privileg of first comer  and colonel brandon therefor walk everi night to his old quarter at the park  from whenc he usual return in the morn  earli enough to interrupt the lover  first tete  a  tete befor breakfast  a three week  resid at delaford  where  in his even hour at least  he had littl to do but to calcul the disproport between thirti  six and seventeen  brought him to barton in a temper of mind which need all the improv in mariann  s look  all the kind of her welcom  and all the encourag of her mother  s languag  to make it cheer  among such friend  howev  and such flatteri  he did reviv  no rumour of luci  s marriag had yet reach him  he knew noth of what had pass  and the first hour of his visit were consequ spent in hear and in wonder  everi thing was explain to him by mrs  dashwood  and he found fresh reason to rejoic in what he had done for mr  ferrar  sinc eventu it promot the interest of elinor  it would be needless to say  that the gentlemen advanc in the good opinion of each other  as they advanc in each other  s acquaint  for it could not be otherwis  their resembl in good principl and good sens  in disposit and manner of think  would probabl have been suffici to unit them in friendship  without ani other attract  but their be in love with two sister  and two sister fond of each other  made that mutual regard inevit and immedi  which might otherwis have wait the effect of time and judgment  the letter from town  which a few day befor would have made everi nerv in elinor  s bodi thrill with transport  now arriv to be read with less emot that mirth  mrs  jen wrote to tell the wonder tale  to vent her honest indign against the jilt girl  and pour forth her compass toward poor mr  edward  who  she was sure  had quit dote upon the worthless hussi  and was now  by all account  almost broken  heart  at oxford   i do think  she continu   noth was ever carri on so sli  for it was but two day befor luci call and sat a coupl of hour with me  not a soul suspect anyth of the matter  not even nanci  who  poor soul  came cri to me the day after  in a great fright for fear of mrs  ferrar  as well as not know how to get to plymouth  for luci it seem borrow all her money befor she went off to be marri  on purpos we suppos to make a show with  and poor nanci had not seven shill in the world  so i was veri glad to give her five guinea to take her down to exet  where she think of stay three or four week with mrs  burgess  in hope  as i tell her  to fall in with the doctor again  and i must say that luci  s cross not to take them along with them in the chais is wors than all  poor mr  edward  i cannot get him out of my head  but you must send for him to barton  and miss mariann must tri to comfort him  mr  dashwood  s strain were more solemn  mrs  ferrar was the most unfortun of women  poor fanni had suffer agoni of sensibl  and he consid the exist of each  under such a blow  with grate wonder  robert  s offenc was unpardon  but luci  s was infinit wors  neither of them were ever again to be mention to mrs  ferrar  and even  if she might hereaft be induc to forgiv her son  his wife should never be acknowledg as her daughter  nor be permit to appear in her presenc  the secreci with which everyth had been carri on between them  was ration treat as enorm heighten the crime  becaus  had ani suspicion of it occur to the other  proper measur would have been taken to prevent the marriag  and he call on elinor to join with him in regret that luci  s engag with edward had not rather been fulfil  than that she should thus be the mean of spread miseri farther in the famili  he thus continu   mrs  ferrar has never yet mention edward  s name  which doe not surpris us  but  to our great astonish  not a line has been receiv from him on the occas  perhap  howev  he is kept silent by his fear of offend  and i shall  therefor  give him a hint  by a line to oxford  that his sister and i both think a letter of proper submiss from him  address perhap to fanni  and by her shewn to her mother  might not be taken amiss  for we all know the tender of mrs  ferrar  s heart  and that she wish for noth so much as to be on good term with her children  this paragraph was of some import to the prospect and conduct of edward  it determin him to attempt a reconcili  though not exact in the manner point out by their brother and sister   a letter of proper submiss  repeat he   would they have me beg my mother  s pardon for robert  s ingratitud to her  and breach of honour to me  i can make no submiss  i am grown neither humbl nor penit by what has pass  i am grown veri happi  but that would not interest  i know of no submiss that is proper for me to make   you may certain ask to be forgiven  said elinor   becaus you have offend  and i should think you might now ventur so far as to profess some concern for have ever form the engag which drew on you your mother  s anger  he agre that he might   and when she has forgiven you  perhap a littl humil may be conveni while acknowledg a second engag  almost as imprud in her eye as the first  he had noth to urg against it  but still resist the idea of a letter of proper submiss  and therefor  to make it easier to him  as he declar a much greater willing to make mean concess by word of mouth than on paper  it was resolv that  instead of write to fanni  he should go to london  and person intreat her good offic in his favour   and if they realli do interest themselv  said mariann  in her new charact of candour   in bring about a reconcili  i shall think that even john and fanni are not entir without merit  after a visit on colonel brandon  s side of onli three or four day  the two gentlemen quit barton togeth  they were to go immedi to delaford  that edward might have some person knowledg of his futur home  and assist his patron and friend in decid on what improv were need to it  and from thenc  after stay there a coupl of night  he was to proceed on his journey to town  chapter 50 after a proper resist on the part of mrs  ferrar  just so violent and so steadi as to preserv her from that reproach which she alway seem fear of incur  the reproach of be too amiabl  edward was admit to her presenc  and pronounc to be again her son  her famili had of late been exceed fluctuat  for mani year of her life she had had two son  but the crime and annihil of edward a few week ago  had rob her of one  the similar annihil of robert had left her for a fortnight without ani  and now  by the resuscit of edward  she had one again  in spite of his be allow onc more to live  howev  he did not feel the continu of his exist secur  till he had reveal his present engag  for the public of that circumst  he fear  might give a sudden turn to his constitut  and carri him off as rapid as befor  with apprehens caution therefor it was reveal  and he was listen to with unexpect calm  mrs  ferrar at first reason endeavour to dissuad him from marri miss dashwood  by everi argument in her power  told him  that in miss morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortun  and enforc the assert  by observ that miss morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirti thousand pound  while miss dashwood was onli the daughter of a privat gentleman with no more than three  but when she found that  though perfect admit the truth of her represent  he was by no mean inclin to be guid by it  she judg it wisest  from the experi of the past  to submit  and therefor  after such an ungraci delay as she owe to her own digniti  and as serv to prevent everi suspicion of good  will  she issu her decre of consent to the marriag of edward and elinor  what she would engag to do toward augment their incom was next to be consid  and here it plain appear  that though edward was now her onli son  he was by no mean her eldest  for while robert was inevit endow with a thousand pound a  year  not the smallest object was made against edward  s take order for the sake of two hundr and fifti at the utmost  nor was anyth promis either for the present or in futur  beyond the ten thousand pound  which had been given with fanni  it was as much  howev  as was desir  and more than was expect  by edward and elinor  and mrs  ferrar herself  by her shuffl excus  seem the onli person surpris at her not give more  with an incom quit suffici to their want thus secur to them  they had noth to wait for after edward was in possess of the live  but the readi of the hous  to which colonel brandon  with an eager desir for the accommod of elinor  was make consider improv  and after wait some time for their complet  after experienc  as usual  a thousand disappoint and delay from the unaccount dilatori of the workmen  elinor  as usual  broke through the first posit resolut of not marri till everi thing was readi  and the ceremoni took place in barton church earli in the autumn  the first month after their marriag was spent with their friend at the mansion  hous  from whenc they could superintend the progress of the parsonag  and direct everi thing as they like on the spot  could chuse paper  project shrubberi  and invent a sweep  mrs  jen  s propheci  though rather jumbl togeth  were chiefli fulfil  for she was abl to visit edward and his wife in their parsonag by michaelma  and she found in elinor and her husband  as she realli believ  one of the happiest coupl in the world  they had in fact noth to wish for  but the marriag of colonel brandon and mariann  and rather better pasturag for their cow  they were visit on their first settl by almost all their relat and friend  mrs  ferrar came to inspect the happi which she was almost asham of have authoris  and even the dashwood were at the expens of a journey from sussex to do them honour   i will not say that i am disappoint  my dear sister  said john  as they were walk togeth one morn befor the gate of delaford hous   that would be say too much  for certain you have been one of the most fortun young women in the world  as it is  but  i confess  it would give me great pleasur to call colonel brandon brother  his properti here  his place  his hous  everi thing is in such respect and excel condit  and his wood  i have not seen such timber ani where in dorsetshir  as there is now stand in delaford hanger  and though  perhap  mariann may not seem exact the person to attract him  yet i think it would altogeth be advis for you to have them now frequent stay with you  for as colonel brandon seem a great deal at home  nobodi can tell what may happen  for  when peopl are much thrown togeth  and see littl of anybodi els  and it will alway be in your power to set her off to advantag  and so forth  in short  you may as well give her a chanc  you understand me  but though mrs  ferrar did come to see them  and alway treat them with the make  believ of decent affect  they were never insult by her real favour and prefer  that was due to the folli of robert  and the cun of his wife  and it was earn by them befor mani month had pass away  the selfish sagac of the latter  which had at first drawn robert into the scrape  was the princip instrument of his deliver from it  for her respect humil  assidu attent  and endless flatteri  as soon as the smallest open was given for their exercis  reconcil mrs  ferrar to his choic  and re  establish him complet in her favour  the whole of luci  s behaviour in the affair  and the prosper which crown it  therefor  may be held forth as a most encourag instanc of what an earnest  an unceas attent to self  interest  howev it progress may be appar obstruct  will do in secur everi advantag of fortun  with no other sacrific than that of time and conscienc  when robert first sought her acquaint  and privat visit her in bartlett  s build  it was onli with the view imput to him by his brother  he mere meant to persuad her to give up the engag  and as there could be noth to overcom but the affect of both  he natur expect that one or two interview would settl the matter  in that point  howev  and that onli  he er  for though luci soon gave him hope that his eloqu would convinc her in time  anoth visit  anoth convers  was alway want to produc this convict  some doubt alway linger in her mind when they part  which could onli be remov by anoth half hour  s discours with himself  his attend was by this mean secur  and the rest follow in cours  instead of talk of edward  they came gradual to talk onli of robert  a subject on which he had alway more to say than on ani other  and in which she soon betray an interest even equal to his own  and in short  it becam speedili evid to both  that he had entir supplant his brother  he was proud of his conquest  proud of trick edward  and veri proud of marri privat without his mother  s consent  what immedi follow is known  they pass some month in great happi at dawlish  for she had mani relat and old acquaint to cut  and he drew sever plan for magnific cottag  and from thenc return to town  procur the forgiv of mrs  ferrar  by the simpl expedi of ask it  which  at luci  s instig  was adopt  the forgiv  at first  inde  as was reason  comprehend onli robert  and luci  who had owe his mother no duti and therefor could have transgress none  still remain some week longer unpardon  but persever in humil of conduct and messag  in self  condemn for robert  s offenc  and gratitud for the unkind she was treat with  procur her in time the haughti notic which overcam her by it gracious  and led soon afterward  by rapid degre  to the highest state of affect and influenc  luci becam as necessari to mrs  ferrar  as either robert or fanni  and while edward was never cordial forgiven for have onc intend to marri her  and elinor  though superior to her in fortun and birth  was spoken of as an intrud  she was in everi thing consid  and alway open acknowledg  to be a favourit child  they settl in town  receiv veri liber assist from mrs  ferrar  were on the best term imagin with the dashwood  and set asid the jealousi and ill  will continu subsist between fanni and luci  in which their husband of cours took a part  as well as the frequent domest disagr between robert and luci themselv  noth could exceed the harmoni in which they all live togeth  what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son  might have puzzl mani peopl to find out  and what robert had done to succeed to it  might have puzzl them still more  it was an arrang  howev  justifi in it effect  if not in it caus  for noth ever appear in robert  s style of live or of talk to give a suspicion of his regret the extent of his incom  as either leav his brother too littl  or bring himself too much  and if edward might be judg from the readi discharg of his duti in everi particular  from an increas attach to his wife and his home  and from the regular cheer of his spirit  he might be suppos no less content with his lot  no less free from everi wish of an exchang  elinor  s marriag divid her as littl from her famili as could well be contriv  without render the cottag at barton entir useless  for her mother and sister spent much more than half their time with her  mrs  dashwood was act on motiv of polici as well as pleasur in the frequenc of her visit at delaford  for her wish of bring mariann and colonel brandon togeth was hard less earnest  though rather more liber than what john had express  it was now her darl object  precious as was the compani of her daughter to her  she desir noth so much as to give up it constant enjoy to her valu friend  and to see mariann settl at the mansion  hous was equal the wish of edward and elinor  they each felt his sorrow  and their own oblig  and mariann  by general consent  was to be the reward of all  with such a confederaci against her  with a knowledg so intim of his good  with a convict of his fond attach to herself  which at last  though long after it was observ to everybodi els  burst on her  what could she do  mariann dashwood was born to an extraordinari fate  she was born to discov the falsehood of her own opinion  and to counteract  by her conduct  her most favourit maxim  she was born to overcom an affect form so late in life as at seventeen  and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and live friendship  voluntarili to give her hand to anoth  and that other  a man who had suffer no less than herself under the event of a former attach  whom  two year befor  she had consid too old to be marri  and who still sought the constitut safeguard of a flannel waistcoat  but so it was  instead of fall a sacrific to an irresist passion  as onc she had fond flatter herself with expect  instead of remain even for ever with her mother  and find her onli pleasur in retir and studi  as afterward in her more calm and sober judgment she had determin on  she found herself at nineteen  submit to new attach  enter on new duti  place in a new home  a wife  the mistress of a famili  and the patro of a villag  colonel brandon was now as happi  as all those who best love him  believ he deserv to be  in mariann he was consol for everi past afflict  her regard and her societi restor his mind to anim  and his spirit to cheer  and that mariann found her own happi in form his  was equal the persuas and delight of each observ friend  mariann could never love by halv  and her whole heart becam  in time  as much devot to her husband  as it had onc been to willoughbi  willoughbi could not hear of her marriag without a pang  and his punish was soon afterward complet in the voluntari forgiv of mrs  smith  who  by state his marriag with a woman of charact  as the sourc of her clemenc  gave him reason for believ that had he behav with honour toward mariann  he might at onc have been happi and rich  that his repent of misconduct  which thus brought it own punish  was sincer  need not be doubt  nor that he long thought of colonel brandon with envi  and of mariann with regret  but that he was for ever inconsol  that he fled from societi  or contract an habitu gloom of temper  or die of a broken heart  must not be depend on  for he did neither  he live to exert  and frequent to enjoy himself  his wife was not alway out of humour  nor his home alway uncomfort  and in his breed of hors and dog  and in sport of everi kind  he found no inconsider degre of domest felic  for mariann  howev  in spite of his incivil in surviv her loss  he alway retain that decid regard which interest him in everi thing that befel her  and made her his secret standard of perfect in woman  and mani a rise beauti would be slight by him in after  day as bear no comparison with mrs  brandon  mrs  dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottag  without attempt a remov to delaford  and fortun for sir john and mrs  jen  when mariann was taken from them  margaret had reach an age high suitabl for danc  and not veri inelig for be suppos to have a lover  between barton and delaford  there was that constant communic which strong famili affect would natur dictat  and among the merit and the happi of elinor and mariann  let it not be rank as the least consider  that though sister  and live almost within sight of each other  they could live without disagr between themselv  or produc cool between their husband  the end
