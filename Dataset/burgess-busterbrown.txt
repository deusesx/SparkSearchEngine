the top of his lung  and he knew by the sound that blacki was get into mischief of some kind  he heard the sweet voic of happi littl singer  and they were good to hear  but most of all he listen to a merri  low  silveri laugh that never stop but went on and on  until he just felt as if he must laugh too  it was the voic of the laugh brook  and as buster listen it sudden came to him just what he want for breakfast   i  m go fish  said he in his deep grumbl  rumbl voic to no one in particular   yes  sir  i  m go fish  i want some fat trout for my breakfast  he shuffl along over to the laugh

call him a thief and everyth bad he could think of  buster didn  t seem to mind  he chuckl as if he thought it all a great joke and repeat his invit to littl joe to come and get his fish  but littl joe just turn his back and went off down the laugh brook in a great rage   it  s too bad to wast such a fine fish  said buster thought   i wonder what i  d better do with it  and while he was wonder  he ate it all up  then he start down the laugh brook to tri to catch some for himself  ii littl joe otter get even with buster bear littl joe otter was in a terribl rage  it was a bad begin for a beauti day and littl joe knew it  but who wouldn  t be in a rage if his breakfast was taken from him just as he was about to eat it  anyway  that is what littl joe told billi mink  perhap he didn  t tell it quit exact as it was  but you know he was veri bad frighten at the time   i was sit on the bank of the laugh brook besid one of the littl pool  he told billi mink   and was just go to eat a fat trout i had caught  when who should come along but that great big bulli  buster bear  he took that fat trout away from me and ate it just as if it belong to him  i hate him  if i live long enough i  m go to get even with him  of cours that wasn  t nice talk and anyth but a nice spirit  but littl joe otter  s temper is sometim pretti short  especi when he is hungri  and this time he had had no breakfast  you know  buster bear hadn  t actual taken the fish away from littl joe  but look at the matter as littl joe did  it amount to the same thing  you see  buster knew perfect well when he invit littl joe to come back and get it that littl joe wouldn  t dare do anyth of the kind   where is he now  ask billi mink   he  s somewher up the laugh brook  i wish he  d fall in and get drown  snap littl joe  billi mink just had to laugh  the idea of great big buster bear get drown in the laugh brook was too funni  there wasn  t water enough in it anywher except down in the smile pool  and that was on the green meadow  where buster had never been known to go   let  s go see what he is do  said billi mink  at first littl joe didn  t want to  but at last his curios got the better of his fear  and he agre  so the two littl brown  coat scamp turn down the laugh brook  take the greatest care to keep out of sight themselv  they had gone onli a littl way when billi mink whisper   sh  h  there he is  sure enough  there was buster bear sit close besid a littl pool and look into it veri intent   what  s he do  ask littl joe otter  as buster bear sat for the longest time without move  just then one of buster  s big paw went into the water as quick as a flash and scoop out a trout that had ventur too near   he  s fish  exclaim billi mink  and that is just what buster bear was do  and it was veri plain to see that he was have great fun  when he had eaten the trout he had caught  he move along to the next littl pool   they are our fish  said littl joe fierc   he has no busi catch our fish   i don  t see how we are go to stop him  said billi mink   i do  cri littl joe  into whose head an idea had just pop   i  m go to drive all the fish out of the littl pool and muddi the water all up  then we  ll see how mani fish he will get  just you watch me get even with buster bear  littl joe slip swift into the water and swam straight to the littl pool that buster bear would tri next  he frighten the fish so that they fled in everi direct  then he stir up the mud until the water was so dirti that buster couldn  t have seen a fish right under his nose  he did the same thing in the next pool and the next  buster bear  s fish was spoil for that day  iii buster bear is great puzzl buster bear hadn  t enjoy himself so much sinc he came to the green forest to live  his fun began when he surpris littl joe otter on the bank of a littl pool in the laugh brook and littl joe was so frighten that he drop a fat trout he had just caught  it had seem like a great joke to buster bear  and he had chuckl over it all the time he was eat the fat trout  when he had finish it  he start on to do some fish himself  present he came to anoth littl pool  he stole up to it veri  veri soft  so as not to frighten the fish  then he sat down close to the edg of it and didn  t move  buster learn a long time ago that a fisherman must be patient unless  like littl joe otter  he is just as much at home in the water as the fish themselv  and can swim fast enough to catch them by chase them  so he didn  t move so much as an eye lash  he was so still that he look almost like the stump of an old tree  perhap that is what the fish thought he was  for pretti soon  two or three swam right in close to where he was sit  now buster bear may be big and clumsi look  but there isn  t anyth that can move much quicker than one of those big paw of his when he want it to  one of them move now  and quicker than a wink had scoop one of those foolish fish out on to the bank  buster  s littl eye twinkl  and he smack his lip as he move on to the next littl pool  for he knew that it was of no use to stay longer at the first one  the fish were so frighten that they wouldn  t come back for a long  long time  at the next littl pool the same thing happen  by this time buster bear was in fine spirit  it was fun to catch the fish  and it was still more fun to eat them  what finer breakfast could ani one have than fresh  caught trout  no wonder he felt good  but it take more than three trout to fill buster bear  s stomach  so he kept on to the next littl pool  but this littl pool  instead of be beauti and clear so that buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were ani fish there  was so muddi that he couldn  t see into it at all  it look as if some one had just stir up all the mud at the bottom   huh  said buster bear   it  s of no use to tri to fish here  i would just wast my time  i  ll tri the next pool  so he went on to the next littl pool  he found this just as muddi as the other  then he went on to anoth  and this was no better  buster sat down and scratch his head  it was puzzl  yes  sir  it was puzzl  he look this way and he look that way suspici  but there was no one to be seen  everyth was still save for the laughter of the laugh brook  somehow  it seem to buster as if the brook were laugh at him   it  s veri curious  mutter buster   veri curious inde  it look as if my fish is spoil for to  day  i don  t understand it at all  it  s lucki i caught what i did  it look as if somebodi is tri to  ha  a sudden thought had pop into his head  then he began to chuckl and final to laugh   i do believ that scamp joe otter is tri to get even with me for eat that fat trout  and then  becaus buster bear alway enjoy a good joke even when it is on himself  he laugh until he had to hold his side  which is a whole lot better than go off in a rage as littl joe otter had done   you  re pretti smart  mr  otter  you  re pretti smart  but there are other peopl who are smart too  said buster bear  and still chuckl  he went off to think up a plan to get the best of littl joe otter  iv littl joe otter suppli buster bear with a breakfast get even just for spite doesn  t alway pay  fact is  it is veri apt to work the other way  that is just how it came about that littl joe otter furnish buster bear with the best breakfast he had had for a long time  he didn  t mean to do it  oh  my  no  the truth is  he thought all the time that he was prevent buster bear from get a breakfast  you see he wasn  t well enough acquaint with buster to know that buster is quit as smart as he is  and perhap a littl bit smarter  spite and selfish were at the bottom of it  you see littl joe and billi mink had had all the fish in the laugh brook to themselv so long that they thought no one els had ani right to fish there  to be sure bobbi coon caught a few littl fish there  but they didn  t mind bobbi  farmer brown  s boy fish there too  sometim  and this alway made littl joe and billi mink veri angri  but they were so afraid of him that they didn  t dare do anyth about it  but when they discov that buster bear was a fisherman  they made up their mind that someth had got to be done  at least  littl joe did   he  ll tri it again to  morrow morn  said littl joe   i  ll keep watch  and as soon as i see him come  i  ll drive out all the fish  just as i did to  day  i guess that  ll teach him to let our fish alon  so the next morn littl joe hid befor daylight close by the littl pool where buster bear had given him such a fright  sure enough  just as the jolli sunbeam began to creep through the green forest  he saw buster bear come straight over to the littl pool  littl joe slip into the water and chase all the fish out of the littl pool  and stir up the mud on the bottom so that the water was so muddi that the bottom couldn  t be seen at all  then he hurri down to the next littl pool and did the same thing  now buster bear is veri smart  you know he had guess the day befor who had spoil his fish  so this morn he onli went far enough to make sure that if littl joe were watch for him  as he was sure he would be  he would see him come  then  instead of keep on to the littl pool  he hurri to a place way down the laugh brook  where the water was veri shallow  hard over his feet  and there he sat chuckl to himself  thing happen just as he had expect  the frighten fish littl joe chase out of the littl pool up abov swam down the laugh brook  becaus  you know  littl joe was behind them  and there was nowher els for them to go  when they came to the place where buster was wait  all he had to do was to scoop them out on to the bank  it was great fun  it didn  t take buster long to catch all the fish he could eat  then he save a nice fat trout and wait  by and by along came littl joe otter  chuckl to think how he had spoil buster bear  s fish  he was so intent on look behind him to see if buster was come that he didn  t see buster wait there until he spoke   i  m much oblig for the fine breakfast you have given me  said buster in his deepest  most grumbl  rumbl voic   i  ve save a fat trout for you to make up for the one i ate yesterday  i hope we  ll go fish togeth often  then he went off laugh fit to kill himself  littl joe couldn  t find a word to say  he was so surpris and angri that he went off by himself and sulk  and billi mink  who had been watch  ate the fat trout  v grandfath frog  s common  sens there is noth quit like common sens to smooth out troubl  peopl who have plenti of just plain common sens are often thought to be veri wise  their neighbor look up to them and are forev run to them for advic  and they are veri much respect  that is the way with grandfath frog  he is veri old and veri wise  anyway  that is what his neighbor think  the truth is  he simpli has a lot of common sens  which after all is the veri best kind of wisdom  now when littl joe otter found that buster bear had been too smart for him and that instead of spoil buster  s fish in the laugh brook he had realli made it easier for buster to catch all the fish he want  littl joe went off down to the smile pool in a great rage  billi mink stop long enough to eat the fat fish buster had left on the bank and then he too went down to the smile pool  when littl joe otter and billi mink reach the smile pool  they climb up on the big rock  and there littl joe sulk and sulk  until final grandfath frog ask what the matter was  littl joe wouldn  t tell  but billi mink told the whole stori  when he told how buster had been too smart for littl joe  it tickl him so that billi had to laugh in spite of himself  so did grandfath frog  so did jerri muskrat  who had been listen  of cours this made littl joe angrier than ever  he said a lot of unkind thing about buster bear and about billi mink and grandfath frog and jerri muskrat  becaus they had laugh at the smart of buster   he  s noth but a great big bulli and thief  declar littl joe   chug  a  rum  he may be a bulli  becaus great big peopl are veri apt to be bulli  and though i haven  t seen him  i guess buster bear is big enough from all i have heard  but i don  t see how he is a thief  said grandfath frog   didn  t he catch my fish and eat them  snap littl joe   doesn  t that make him a thief   they were no more your fish than mine  protest billi mink   well  our fish  then  he stole our fish  if you like that ani better  that make him just as much a thief  doesn  t it  growl littl joe  grandfath frog look up at jolli  round  bright mr  sun and slowli wink one of his great  gogg eye   there come a foolish green fli  said he   who doe he belong to   nobodi  snap littl joe   what have foolish green fli got to do with my  i mean our fish   noth  noth at all  repli grandfath frog mild   i was just hope that he would come near enough for me to snap him up  then he would belong to me  as long as he doesn  t  he doesn  t belong to ani one  i suppos that if buster bear should happen along and catch him  he would be steal from me  accord to littl joe   of cours not  what a silli idea  you  re get foolish in your old age  retort littl joe   can you tell me the differ between the fish that you haven  t caught and the foolish green fli that i haven  t caught  ask grandfath frog  littl joe couldn  t find a word to say   you take my advic  littl joe otter  continu grandfath frog   and alway make friend with those who are bigger and stronger and smarter than you are  you  ll find it pay   illustr   you take my advic  littl joe otter  continu grandfath frog  page 26    vi littl joe otter take grandfath frog  s advic who make an enemi a friend  to fear and worri put an end  littl joe otter found that out when he took grandfath frog  s advic  he wouldn  t have admit that he was afraid of buster bear  no one ever like to admit be afraid  least of all littl joe otter  and realli littl joe has a great deal of courag  veri few of the littl peopl of the green forest or the green meadow would will quarrel with him  for littl joe is a great fighter when he has to fight  as for all those who live in or along the laugh brook or in the smile pool  they let littl joe have his own way in everyth  now have one  s own way too much is a bad thing  it is apt to make one selfish and thoughtless of other peopl and veri hard to get along with  littl joe otter had his way too much  grandfath frog knew it and shook his head veri sober when littl joe had been disrespect to him   too bad  too bad  too bad  chug  a  rum  it is too bad that such a fine young fellow as littl joe should spoil a good disposit by such selfish heedless  too bad  said he  so  though he didn  t let on that it was so  grandfath frog realli was delight when he heard how buster bear had been too smart for littl joe otter  it tickl him so that he had hard work to keep a straight face  but he did and was as grave and solemn as you pleas as he advis littl joe alway to make friend with ani one who was bigger and stronger and smarter than he  that was good common sens advic  but littl joe just snif and went off declar that he would get even with buster bear yet  now littl joe is good  natur and full of fun as a rule  and after he had reach home and his temper had cool off a littl  he began to see the joke on himself  how when he had work so hard to frighten the fish in the littl pool of the laugh brook so that buster bear should not catch ani  he had all the time been drive them right into buster  s paw  by and by he grin  it was a littl sheepish grin at first  but at last it grew into a laugh   i believ  said littl joe as he wipe tear of laughter from his eye   that grandfath frog is right  and that the best thing i can do is to make friend with buster bear  i  ll tri it to  morrow morn  so veri earli the next morn littl joe otter went to the best fish pool he knew of in the laugh brook  and there he caught the biggest trout he could find  it was so big and fat that it made littl joe  s mouth water  for you know fat trout are his favorit food  but he didn  t take so much as one bite  instead he care laid it on an old log where buster bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that way  then he hid near by  where he could watch  buster was late that morn  it seem to littl joe that he never would come  onc he near lost the fish  he had turn his head for just a minut  and when he look back again  the trout was nowher to be seen  buster couldn  t have stolen up and taken it  becaus such a big fellow couldn  t possibl have gotten out of sight again  littl joe dart over to the log and look on the other side  there was the fat trout  and there also was littl joe  s smallest cousin  shadow the weasel  who is a great thief and altogeth bad  littl joe sprang at him angrili  but shadow was too quick and dart away  littl joe put the fish back on the log and wait  this time he didn  t take his eye off it  at last  when he was almost readi to give up  he saw buster bear shuffl along toward the laugh brook  sudden buster stop and snif  one of the merri littl breez had carri the scent of that fat trout over to him  then he came straight over to where the fish lay  his nose wrinkl  and his eye twinkl with pleasur   now i wonder who was so thought as to leav this fine breakfast readi for me  said he out loud   me  said littl joe in a rather faint voic   i caught it especi for you   thank you  repli buster  and his eye twinkl more than ever   i think we are go to be friend   i  i hope so  repli littl joe  vii farmer brown  s boy has no luck at all farmer brown  s boy tramp through the green forest  whistl merrili  he alway whistl when he feel light  heart  and he alway feel light  heart when he goe fish  you see  he is just as fond of fish as is littl joe otter or billi mink or buster bear  and now he was make his way through the green forest to the laugh brook  sure that by the time he had follow it down to the smile pool he would have a fine lot of trout to take home  he knew everi pool in the laugh brook where the trout love to hide  did farmer brown  s boy  and it was just the kind of a morn when the trout should be hungri  so he whistl as he tramp along  and his whistl was good to hear  when he reach the first littl pool he bait his hook veri care and then  take the greatest care to keep out of sight of ani trout that might be in the littl pool  he began to fish  now farmer brown  s boy learn a long time ago that to be a success fisherman one must have a great deal of patienc  so though he didn  t get a bite right away as he had expect to  he wasn  t the least bit discourag  he kept veri quiet and fish and fish  patient wait for a foolish trout to take his hook  but he didn  t get so much as a nibbl   either the trout have lost their appetit or they have grown veri wise  mutter farmer brown  s boy  as after a long time he move on to the next littl pool  there the same thing happen  he was veri patient  veri  veri patient  but his patienc brought no reward  not so much as the faintest kind of a nibbl  farmer brown  s boy trudg on to the next pool  and there was a puzzl frown on his freckl face  such a thing never had happen befor  he didn  t know what to make of it  all the night befor he had dream about the delici dinner of fri trout he would have the next day  and now  well  if he didn  t catch some trout pretti soon  that splendid dinner would never be anyth but a dream   if i didn  t know that nobodi els come fish here  i should think that somebodi had been here this veri morn and caught all the fish or els frighten them so that they are all in hide  said he  as he trudg on to the next littl pool   i never had such bad luck in all my life befor  hello  what  s this  there  on the bank besid the littl pool  were the head of three trout  farmer brown  s boy scowl down at them more puzzl than ever   somebodi has been fish here  and they have had better luck than i have  thought he  he look up the laugh brook and down the laugh brook and this way and that way  but no one was to be seen  then he pick up one of the littl head and look at it sharpli   it wasn  t cut off with a knife  it was bitten off  he exclaim   i wonder now if billi mink is the scamp who has spoil my fun  thereaft he kept a sharp lookout for sign of billi mink  but though he found two or three more trout head  he saw no other sign and he caught no fish  this puzzl him more than ever  it didn  t seem possibl that such a littl fellow as billi mink could have caught or frighten all the fish or have eaten so mani  besid  he didn  t rememb ever have known billi to leav head around that way  billi sometim catch more fish than he can eat  but then he usual hide them  the farther he went down the laugh brook  the more puzzl farmer brown  s boy grew  it made him feel veri queer  he would have felt still more queer if he had known that all the time two other fishermen who had been befor him were watch him and chuckl to themselv  they were littl joe otter and buster bear  viii farmer brown  s boy feel his hair rise  twas just a sudden odd surpris made farmer brown  s boy  s hair to rise  that  s a funni thing for hair to do  rise up all of a sudden  isn  t it  but that is just what the hair on farmer brown  s boy  s head did the day he went fish in the laugh brook and had no luck at all  there are just two thing that make hair rise  anger and fear  anger sometim make the hair on the back and neck of bowser the hound and of some other littl peopl bristl and stand up  and you know the hair on the tail of black pussi stand on end until her tail look twice as big as it realli is  both anger and fear make it do that  but there is onli one thing that can make the hair on the head of farmer brown  s boy rise  and as it isn  t anger  of cours it must be fear  it never had happen befor  you see  there isn  t much of anyth that farmer brown  s boy is realli afraid of  perhap he wouldn  t have been afraid this time if it hadn  t been for the surpris of what he found  you see when he had found the head of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one els had been fish  and that was whi he couldn  t catch ani  but it didn  t seem possibl that littl billi mink could have eaten all those trout  and farmer brown  s boy didn  t onc think of littl joe otter  and so he was veri  veri much puzzl  he was turn it all over in his mind and studi what it could mean  when he came to a littl muddi place on the bank of the laugh brook  and there he saw someth that made his eye look as if they would pop right out of his head  and it was right then that he felt his hair rise  anyway  that is what he said when he told about it afterward  what was it he saw  what do you think  whi  it was a footprint in the soft mud  yes  sir  that  s what it was  and all it was  but it was the biggest footprint farmer brown  s boy ever had seen  and it look as if it had been made onli a few minut befor  it was the footprint of buster bear  now farmer brown  s boy didn  t know that buster bear had come down to the green forest to live  he never had heard of a bear be in the green forest  and so he was so surpris that he had hard work to believ his own eye  and he had a queer feel all over  a littl chilli feel  although it was a warm day  somehow  he didn  t feel like meet buster bear  if he had had his terribl gun with him  it might have been differ  but he didn  t  and so he sudden made up his mind that he didn  t want to fish ani more that day  he had a funni feel  too  that he was be watch  although he couldn  t see ani one  he was be watch  littl joe otter and buster bear were watch him and take the greatest care to keep out of his sight  all the way home through the green forest  farmer brown  s boy kept look behind him  and he didn  t draw a long breath until he reach the edg of the green forest  he hadn  t run  but he had want to   huh  said

veri earli  sammi jay and i will make a great fuss near the edg of the green forest  farmer brown  s boy has a lot of curios  and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about  then we will lead him to where buster bear is  if he run away  i will be the first to admit that buster bear is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is  it is a veri simpl plan  and if you will all hide where you can watch  you will be abl to see for yourselv if littl joe otter is right  now what do you say  right away everybodi began to talk at the same time  it was such a simpl plan that everybodi agre to it  and it promis to be so excit that everybodi promis to be there  that is  everybodi but grandfath frog and spotti the turtl  who didn  t care to go so far away from the smile pool  so it was agre that blacki should tri his plan the veri next morn  xii farmer brown  s boy and buster bear grow curious ever sinc it was light enough to see at all  blacki the crow had been sit in the top of the tallest tree on the edg of the green forest nearest to farmer brown  s hous  and never for an instant had he taken his eye from farmer brown  s back door  what was he watch for  whi  for farmer brown  s boy to come out on his way to milk the cow  meanwhil  sammi jay was slip silent through the green forest  look for buster bear  so that when the time came he could let his cousin  blacki the crow  know just where buster was  by and by the back door of farmer brown  s hous open  and out step farmer brown  s boy  in each hand he carri a milk pail  right away blacki began to scream at the top of his lung   caw  caw  caw  shout blacki   caw  caw  caw  and all the time he flew about among the tree near the edg of the green forest as if so excit that he couldn  t keep still  farmer brown  s boy look over there as if he wonder what all that fuss was about  as inde he did  but he didn  t start to go over and see  no  sir  he start straight for the barn  blacki didn  t know what to make of it  you see  smart as he is and shrewd as he is  blacki doesn  t know anyth about the mean of duti  for he never has to work except to get enough to eat  so  when farmer brown  s boy start for the barn instead of for the green forest  blacki didn  t know what to make of it  he scream harder and louder than ever  until his voic grew so hoars he couldn  t scream ani more  but farmer brown  s boy kept right on to the barn   i  d like to know what you  re make such a fuss about  mr  crow  but i  ve got to feed the cow and milk them first  said he  now all this time the other littl peopl of the green forest and the green meadow had been hide where they could see all that went on  when farmer brown  s boy disappear in the barn  chatter the red squirrel snicker right out loud   ha  ha  ha  this is a great plan of your  blacki  ha  ha  ha  he shout  blacki couldn  t find a word to say  he just hung his head  which is someth blacki seldom doe   perhap if we wait until he come out again  he will come over here  said sammi jay  who had join blacki  so it was decid to wait  it seem as if farmer brown  s boy never would come out  but at last he did  blacki and sammi jay at onc began to scream and make all the fuss they could  farmer brown  s boy took the two pail of milk into the hous  then out he came and start straight for the green forest  he was so curious to know what it all meant that he couldn  t wait anoth minut  now there was some one els with a great deal of curios also  he had heard the scream of blacki the crow and sammi jay  and he had listen until he couldn  t stand it anoth minut  he just had to know what it was all about  so at the same time farmer brown  s boy start for the green forest  this other listen start toward the place where blacki and sammi were make such a racket  he walk veri soft so as not to make a sound  it was buster bear  xiii farmer brown  s boy and buster bear meet if you should meet with buster bear while walk through the wood  what would you do  now tell me true  i  d run the best i could  that is what farmer brown  s boy did when he met buster bear  and a lot of the littl peopl of the green forest and some from the green meadow saw him  when farmer brown  s boy came hurri home from the laugh brook without ani fish one day and told about the great footprint he had seen in a muddi place on the bank deep in the green forest  and had said his was sure that it was the footprint of a bear  he had been laugh at  farmer brown had laugh and laugh   whi  said he   there hasn  t been a bear in the green forest for year and year and year  not sinc my own grandfath was a littl boy  and that  you know  was a long  long  long time ago  if you want to find mr  bear  you will have to go to the great wood  i don  t know who made that footprint  but it certain couldn  t have been a bear  i think you must have imagin it  then he had laugh some more  all of which goe to show how easi it is to be mistaken  and how foolish it is to laugh at thing you realli don  t know about  buster bear had come to live in the green forest  and farmer brown  s boy had seen his footprint  but farmer brown laugh so much and made fun of him so much  that at last his boy began to think that he must have been mistaken after all  so when he heard blacki the crow and sammi jay make a great fuss near the edg of the green forest  he never onc thought of buster bear  as he start over to see what was go on  when blacki and sammi saw him come  they move a littl farther in to the green forest  still scream in the most excit way  they felt sure that farmer brown  s boy would follow them  and they meant to lead him to where sammi had seen buster bear that morn  then they would find out for sure if what littl joe otter had said was true  that farmer brown  s boy realli was afraid of buster bear  now all around  behind tree and stump  and under thick branch  and even in tree top  were other littl peopl watch with round  wide  open eye to see what would happen  it was veri excit  the most excit thing they could rememb  you see  they had come to believ that farmer brown  s boy wasn  t afraid of anybodi or anyth  and as most of them were veri much afraid of him  they had hard work to believ that he would realli be afraid of even such a great  big  strong fellow as buster bear  everi one was so busi watch farmer brown  s boy that no one saw buster come from the other direct  you see  buster walk veri soft  big as he is  he can walk without make the teeniest  weeniest sound  and that is how it happen that no one saw him or heard him until just as farmer brown  s boy step out from behind one side of a thick littl hemlock  tree  buster bear step out from behind the other side of that same littl tree  and there they were face to face  then everybodi held their breath  even blacki the crow and sammi jay  for just a littl minut it was so still there in the green forest that not the least littl sound could be heard  what was go to happen  xiv a surpris thing happen blacki the crow and sammi jay  look down from the top of a tall tree  held their breath  happi jack the gray squirrel and his cousin  chatter the red

all the other littl peopl who happen to be where they could see did the same thing  you see  it was the most excit moment ever was in the green forest  farmer brown  s boy had just step out from behind one side of a littl hemlock  tree and buster bear had just step out from behind the opposit side of the littl hemlock  tree and neither had known that the other was anywher near  for a whole minut they stood there face to face  gaze into each other  s eye  while everybodi watch and wait  and it seem as if the whole green forest was hold it breath  then someth happen  yes  sir  someth happen  farmer brown  s boy open his mouth and yell  it was such a sudden yell and such a loud yell that it startl chatter so that he near fell from his place in the tree  and it made reddi fox jump to his feet readi to run  and that yell was a yell of fright  there was no doubt about it  for with the yell farmer brown  s boy turn and ran for home  as no one ever had seen him run befor  he ran just as peter rabbit run when he has got to reach the dear old briar  patch befor reddi fox can catch him  which  you know  is as fast as he can run  onc he stumbl and fell  but he scrambl to his feet in a twinkl  and away he went without onc turn his head to see if buster bear was after him  there wasn  t ani doubt that he was afraid  veri much afraid  everybodi lean forward to watch him   what did i tell you  didn  t i say that he was afraid of buster bear  cri littl joe otter  danc about with excit   you were right  littl joe  i  m sorri that i doubt it  see him go  caw  caw  caw  shriek blacki the crow  for a minut or two everybodi forgot about buster bear  then there was a great crash which made everybodi turn to look the other way  what do you think they saw  whi  buster bear was run away too  and he was run twice as fast as farmer brown  s boy  he bump into tree and crash through bush and jump over log  and in almost no time at all he was out of sight  altogeth it was the most surpris thing that the littl peopl of the green forest ever had seen   illustr  buster bear was run away  too  page 71  sammi jay look at blacki the crow  and blacki look at chatter  and chatter look at happi jack  and happi jack look at peter rabbit  and peter look at unc  billi possum  and unc  billi look at bobbi coon  and bobbi look at johnni chuck  and johnni look at reddi fox  and reddi look at jimmi skunk  and jimmi look at billi mink  and billi look at littl joe otter  and for a minut nobodi could say a word  then littl joe gave a funni littl gasp   whi  whi  e  e  said he   i believ buster bear is afraid too  unc  billi possum chuckl   ah believ yo  are right again  brer otter  said he   it cert  nli doe look so  if brer bear isn  t scare  he must have rememb someth impo  tant and has gone to attend to it in a power hurri  then everybodi began to laugh  xv buster bear is a fallen hero a fallen hero is some one to whom everi one has look up as veri brave and then prove to be less brave than he was suppos to be  that was the way with buster bear  when littl joe otter had told how farmer brown  s boy had been afraid at the mere sight of one of buster bear  s big footprint  they had at onc made a hero of buster  at least some of them had  as this was the first time  the veri first time  that they had ever known ani one who live in the green forest to make farmer brown  s boy run away  they look on buster bear with a great deal of respect and were veri proud of him  but now they had seen buster bear and farmer brown  s boy meet face to face  and while it was true that farmer brown  s boy had run away as fast as ever he could  it was also true that buster bear had done the same thing  he had run even faster than farmer brown  s boy  and had hidden in the most lone place he could find in the veri deepest part of the green forest  it was hard to believ  but it was true  and right away everybodi lost a great deal of the respect for buster which they had felt  it is alway that way  they began to say unkind thing about him  they said them among themselv  and some of them even said them to buster when they met him  or said them so that he would hear them  of cours blacki the crow and sammi jay  who  becaus they can fli  have noth to fear from buster  and who alway delight in make other peopl uncomfort  never let a chanc go by to tell buster and everybodi els within hear what they thought of him  they delight in fli about through the green forest until they had found buster bear and then from the safeti of the tree top scream at him   buster bear is big and strong  his teeth are big  his claw are long  in spite of these he run away and hide himself the livelong day  a dozen time a day buster would hear them scream this  he would grind his teeth and glare up at them  but that was all he could do  he couldn  t get at them  he just had to stand it and do noth  but when impud littl chatter the red squirrel shout the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine  tree  buster could stand it no longer  he gave a deep  angri growl that made littl shiver run over chatter  and then sudden he start up that tree after chatter  with a frighten littl shriek chatter scamper to the top of the tree  he hadn  t known that buster could climb  but buster is a splendid climber  especi when the tree is big and stout as this one was  and now he went up after chatter  growl angrili  how chatter did wish that he had kept his tongu still  he ran to the veri top of the tree  so frighten that his teeth chatter  and when he look down and saw buster  s great mouth come nearer and nearer  he near tumbl down with terror  the worst of it was there wasn  t anoth tree near enough for him to jump to  he was in troubl this time  was chatter  sure enough  and there was no one to help him  xvi chatter the red squirrel jump for his life it isn  t veri often that chatter the red squirrel know fear  that is one reason that he is so often impud and sauci  but onc in a while a great fear take possess of him  as when he know that shadow the weasel is look for him  you see  he know that shadow can go wherev he can go  there are veri few of the littl peopl of the green forest and the green meadow who do not know fear at some time or other  but it come to chatter as seldom as to ani one  becaus he is veri sure of himself and his abil to hide or run away from danger  but now as he clung to a littl branch near the top of a tall pine  tree in the green forest and look down at the big sharp teeth of buster bear draw nearer and nearer  and listen to the deep  angri growl that made his hair stand on end  chatter was too frighten to think  if onli he had kept his tongu still instead of say hate thing to buster bear  if onli he had known that buster could climb a tree  if onli he had chosen a tree near enough to other tree for him to jump across  but he had said hate thing  he had chosen to sit in a tree which stood quit by itself  and buster bear could climb  chatter was in the worst kind of troubl  and there was no one to blame but himself  that is usual the case with those who get into troubl  nearer and nearer came buster bear  and deeper and angrier sound his voic  chatter gave a littl frighten gasp and look this way and look that way  what should he do  what could he do  the ground seem a terribl distanc below  if onli he had wing like sammi jay  but he hadn  t   gr  r  r  r  growl buster bear   i  ll teach you manner  i  ll teach you to treat your better with respect  i  ll swallow you whole  that  s what i  ll do  gr  r  r  r   oh  cri chatter   gr  r  r  r  i  ll eat you all up to the last hair on your tail  growl buster  scrambl a littl nearer   oh  oh  cri chatter  and ran out to the veri tip of the littl branch to which he had been cling  now if chatter had onli known it  buster bear couldn  t reach him way up there  becaus the tree was too small at the top for such a big fellow as buster  but chatter didn  t think of that  he gave one more frighten look down at those big teeth  then he shut his eye and jump  jump straight out for the far  away ground  it was a long  long  long way down to the ground  and it certain look as if such a littl fellow as chatter must be kill  but chatter had learn from old mother natur that she had given him certain thing to help him at just such time  and one of them is the power to spread himself veri flat  he did it now  he spread his arm and leg out just as far as he could  and that kept him from fall as fast and as hard as he otherwis would have done  becaus be spread out so flat that way  the air held him up a littl  and then there was his tail  that funni littl tail he is so fond of jerk when he scold  this help him too  it help him keep his balanc and keep from turn over and over  down  down  down he sail and land on his feet  of cours  he hit the ground pretti hard  and for just a second he quit lost his breath  but it was onli for a second  and then he was scurri off as fast as a frighten squirrel could  buster bear watch him and grin   i didn  t catch him that time  he growl   but i guess i gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson  xvii buster bear goe berri buster bear is a great hand to talk to himself when he think no one is around to overhear  it  s a habit  howev  it isn  t a bad habit unless it is carri too far  ani habit becom bad  if it is carri too far  suppos you had a secret  a real secret  someth that nobodi els knew and that you didn  t want anybodi els to know  and suppos you had the habit of talk to yourself  you might  without think  you know  tell that secret out loud to yourself  and some one might  just might happen to overhear  then there wouldn  t be ani secret  that is the way that a habit which isn  t bad in itself can becom bad when it is carri too far  now buster bear had live by himself in the great wood so long that this habit of talk to himself had grown and grown  he did it just to keep from be lonesom  of cours  when he came down to the green forest to live  he brought all his habit with him  that is one thing about habit  you alway take them with you wherev you go  so buster brought this habit of talk to himself down to the green forest  where he had mani more neighbor than he had in the great wood   let me see  let me see  what is there to tempt my appetit  said buster in his deep  grumbl  rumbl voic   i find my appetit isn  t what it ought to be  i need a chang  yes  sir  i need a chang  there is someth i ought to have at this time of year  and i haven  t got it  there is someth that i use to have and don  t have now  ha  i know  i need some fresh fruit  that  s it  fresh fruit  it must be about berri time now  and i  d forgotten all about it  my  my  my  how good some berri would tast  now if i were back up there in the great wood i could have all i could eat  um  m  m  m  make my mouth water just to think of it  there ought to be some up in the old pastur  there ought to be a lot of  em up there  if i wasn  t afraid that some one would see me  i  d go up there  buster sigh  then he sigh again  the more he thought about those berri he felt sure were grow in the old pastur  the more he want some  it seem to him that never in all his life had he want berri as he did now  he wander about uneasili  he was hungri  hungri for berri and noth els  by and by he began talk to himself again   if i wasn  t afraid of be seen  i  d go up to the old pastur this veri minut  seem as if i could tast those berri  he lick his lip hungrili as he spoke  then his face brighten   i know what i  ll do  i  ll go up there at the veri first peep of day to  morrow  i can eat all i want and get back to the green forest befor there is ani danger that farmer brown  s boy or ani one els i  m afraid of will see me  that  s just what i  ll do  my  i wish to  morrow morn would hurri up and come  now though buster didn  t know it  some one had been listen  and that some one was none other than sammi jay  when at last buster lay down for a nap  sammi flew away  chuckl to himself   i believ i  ll visit the old pastur to  morrow morn myself  thought he   i have an idea that someth interest may happen if buster doesn  t chang his mind  sammi was on the lookout veri earli the next morn  the first jolli littl sunbeam had onli reach the green meadow and had not start to creep into the green forest  when he saw a big  dark form steal out of the green forest where it join the old pastur  it move veri swift and silent  as if in a great hurri  sammi knew who it was  it was buster bear  and he was go berri  sammi wait a littl until he could see better  then he too start for the old pastur  xviii somebodi els goe berri isn  t it funni how two peopl will often think of the same thing at the same time  and neither one know that the other is think of it  that is just what happen the day that buster bear first thought of go berri  while he was walk around in the green forest  talk to himself about how hungri he was for some berri and how sure he was that there must be some up in the old pastur  some one els was think about berri and about the old pastur too   will you make me a berri pie if i will get the berri to  morrow  ask farmer brown  s boy of his mother  of cours mrs  brown promis that she would  and so that night farmer brown  s boy went to bed veri earli that he might get up earli in the morn  and all night long he dream of berri and berri pie  he was awak even befor jolli  round  red mr  sun thought it was time to get up  and he was all readi to start for the old pastur when the first jolli littl sunbeam came danc across the green meadow  he carri a big tin pail  and in the bottom of it  wrap up in a piec of paper  was a lunch  for he meant to stay until he fill that pail  if it took all day  now the old pastur is veri larg  it lie at the foot of the big mountain  and even extend a littl way up on the big mountain  there is room in it for mani peopl to pick berri all day without even see each other  unless they roam about a great deal  you see  the bush grow veri thick there  and you cannot see veri far in ani direct  jolli  round  red mr  sun had climb a littl way up in the sky by the time farmer brown  s boy reach the old pastur  and was smile down on all the great world  and all the great world seem to be smile back  farmer brown  s boy start to whistl  and then he stop   if i whistl  thought he   everybodi will know just where i am  and will keep out of sight  and i never can get acquaint with folk if they keep out of sight  you see  farmer brown  s boy was just begin to understand someth that peter rabbit and the other littl peopl of the green meadow and the green forest learn almost as soon as they learn to walk  that if you don  t want to be seen  you mustn  t be heard  so he didn  t whistl as he felt like do  and he tri not to make a bit of nois as he follow an old cow  path toward a place where he knew the berri grew thick and oh  so big  and all the time he kept his eye wide open  and he kept his ear open too  that is how he happen to hear a littl cri  a veri faint littl cri  if he had been whistl  he wouldn  t have heard it at all  he stop to listen  he never had heard a cri just like it befor  at first he couldn  t make out just what it was or where it came from  but one thing he was sure of  and that was that it was a cri of fright  he stood perfect still and listen with all his might  there it was again  help  help  help  and it was veri faint and sound terribl frighten  he wait a minut or two  but heard noth more  then he put down his pail and began a hurri look here  there  and everywher  he was sure that it had come from somewher on the ground  so he peer behind bush and peep behind log and stone  and then just as he had about given up hope of find where it came from  he went around a littl turn in the old cow  path  and there right in front of him was littl mr  gartersnak  and what do you think he was do  well  i don  t like to tell you  but he was tri to swallow one of the children of stickyto the tree toad  of cours farmer brown  s boy didn  t let him  he made littl mr  gartersnak set master stickyto free and held mr  gartersnak until master stickyto was safe out of reach  xix buster bear has a fine time buster bear was have the finest time he had had sinc he came down from the great wood to live in the green forest  to be sure  he wasn  t in the green forest now  but he wasn  t far from it  he was in the old pastur  one edg of which touch one edg of the green forest  and where do you think he was  in the old pastur  whi  right in the middl of the biggest patch of the biggest blueberri he ever had seen in all his life  now if there is ani one thing that buster bear had rather have abov anoth  it is all the berri he can eat  unless it be honey  noth can quit equal honey in buster  s mind  but next to honey give

and he had a feel that he was a great deal more like to meet one of them in the old pastur than deep in the green forest  so when he start to look for berri  he made up his mind that he would eat what

they tast so good that he just had to eat and eat and eat  now you know that buster is a veri big fellow  and it take a lot to fill him up  he kept eat and eat and eat  and the more he ate the more he want  you know how it is  so he wander from one patch of berri to anoth in the old pastur  and never onc thought of the time  somehow  time is the hardest thing in the world to rememb  when you are have a good time  jolli  round  red mr  sun climb higher and higher in the blue  blue sky  he look down on all the great world and saw all that was go on  he saw buster bear in the old pastur  and

a big paw and push it gentl  it tip over and spill out a lot of the berri  yes  it was perfect harmless  buster gave a littl sigh of pure happi  he would eat those berri to the last one  and then he would go home to the green forest  xx buster bear carri off the pail of farmer brown  s boy the question is  did buster bear steal farmer brown  s boy  s pail  to steal is to take someth which belong to some one els  there is no doubt that he stole the berri that were in the pail when he found it  for he deliber ate them  he knew well enough that some one must have pick them  for whoever heard of blueberri grow in tin pail  so there is no doubt that when buster took them  he stole them  but with the pail it was differ  he took the pail  but he didn  t mean to take it  in fact  he didn  t want that pail at all  you see it was this way  when buster found that big tin pail brim full of delici berri in the shade of that big bush in the old pastur  he didn  t stop to think whether or not he had a right to them  buster is so fond of berri that from the veri second that his greedi littl eye saw that pail  he forgot everyth but the feast that was wait for him right under his veri nose  he didn  t think anyth about the right or wrong of help himself  there befor him were more berri than he had ever seen togeth at one time in all his life  and all he had to do was to eat and eat and eat  and that is just what he did do  of cours he upset the pail  but he didn  t mind a littl thing like that  when he had gobbl up all the berri that roll out  he thrust his nose into the pail to get all that were left in it  just then he heard a littl nois  as if some one were come  he threw up his head to listen  and somehow  he never did know just how  the handl of the pail slip back over his ear and caught there  this was bad enough  but to make matter wors  just at that veri minut he heard a shrill  angri voic shout   hi  there  get out of there  he didn  t need to be told whose voic that was  it was the voic of farmer brown  s boy  right then and there buster bear near had a fit  there was that aw pail fast over his head so that he couldn  t see a thing  of cours  that meant that he couldn  t run away  which was the thing of all thing he most want to do  for big as he is and strong as he is  buster is veri shi and bash when human be are around  he growl and whine and squeal  he tri to back out of the pail and couldn  t  he tri to shake it off and couldn  t  he tri to pull it off  but somehow he couldn  t get hold of it  then there was anoth yell  if buster hadn  t been so frighten himself  he might have recogn that second yell as one of fright  for that is what it was  you see farmer brown  s boy had just discov buster bear  when he had yell the first time  he had suppos that it was one of the young cattl who live in the old pastur all summer  but when he saw buster  he was just as bad frighten as buster himself  in fact  he was too surpris and frighten even to run  after that second yell he just stood still and stare  buster claw at that aw thing on his head more frantic than ever  sudden it slip off  so that he could see  he gave one frighten look at farmer brown  s boy  and then with a mighti  woof  he start for the green forest as fast as his leg could take him  and this was veri fast inde  let me tell you  he didn  t stop to pick out a path  but just crash through the bush as if they were noth at all  just noth at all  but the funniest thing of all is this  he took that pail with him  yes  sir  buster bear ran away with the big tin pail of farmer brown  s boy  you see when it slip off his head  the handl was still around his neck  and there he was run away with a pail hang from his neck  he didn  t want it  he would have given anyth to get rid of it  but he took it becaus he couldn  t help it  and that bring us back to the question  did buster steal farmer brown  s boy  s pail  what do you think  xxi sammi jay make thing wors for buster bear  thief  thief  thief  thief  thief  thief  sammi jay was scream at the top of his lung  as he follow buster bear across the old pastur toward the green forest  never had he scream so loud  and never had his voic sound so excit  the littl peopl of the green forest  the green meadow  and the smile pool are so use to hear sammi cri thief that usual they think veri littl about it  but everi bless one who heard sammi this morn stop whatev he was do and prick up his ear to listen  sammi  s cousin  blacki the crow  just happen to be fli along the edg of the old pastur  and the minut he heard sammi  s

been up in the old pastur when the pail had caught over his head just as farmer brown  s boy had yell at him  then to have the handl of the pail slip down around his neck so that he couldn  t get rid of the pail but had to take it with him as he ran  was make a bad matter wors  now to have all his neighbor of the green forest see him in such a fix and make fun of him  was more than he could stand  he felt humili  that is just anoth way of say shame  yes  sir  buster felt that he was shame in the eye of his neighbor  and he want noth so much as to get away by himself  where no one could see him  and tri to get rid of that dread pail  but buster is so big that it is not easi for him to find a hide place  so  when he reach the green forest  he kept right on to the deepest  darkest  most lonesom part and crept under the thickest hemlock  tree he could find  but it was of no use  the sharp eye of sammi jay and blacki the crow saw him  they actual flew into the veri tree under which he was hide  and how they did scream  pretti soon ol  mistah buzzard came drop down out of the blue  blue sky and took a seat on a conveni dead tree  where he could see all that went on  ol  mistah buzzard began to grin as soon as he saw that tin pail on buster  s neck  then came other  redtail the hawk  scrapper the kingbird  redw the blackbird  drummer the woodpeck  welcom robin  tommi tit the chickade

there they all sat in a great circl around him  each where he felt safe  but where he could see  and everi one of them laugh and make fun of buster   thief  thief  thief  scream sammi until his throat was sore  the worst of it was buster knew that everybodi knew that it was true  that aw pail was proof of it   i wish i never had thought of berri  growl buster to himself  xxii buster bear has a fit of temper a temper is a bad  bad thing when onc it get away  there  s noth quit at all like it to spoil a pleasant day  buster bear was in a terribl temper  yes  sir  buster bear was have the worst fit of temper ever seen in the green forest  and the worst part of it all was that all his neighbor of the green forest and a whole lot from the green meadow and the smile pool were also there to see it  it is bad enough to give way to temper when you are all alon  and there is no one to watch you  but when you let temper get the best of you right where other see you  oh  dear  dear  it certain is a sorri sight  now ordinarili buster is one of the most good  natur person in the world  it take a great deal to rous his temper  he isn  t one tenth so quick temper as chatter the red squirrel  or sammi jay  or reddi fox  but when his temper is arous and get away from him  then watch out  it seem to buster that he had had all that he could stand that day and a littl more  first had come the fright back there in the old pastur  then the pail had slip down behind his ear and held fast  so he had run all the way to the green forest with it hang about his neck  this was bad enough  for he knew just how funni he must look  and besid  it was veri uncomfort  but to have sammi jay call everybodi within hear to come and see him was more than he could stand  it seem to buster as if everybodi who live in the green forest  on the green meadow  or around the smile brook  was sit around his hide place  laugh and make fun of him  it was more than ani self  respect bear could stand  with a roar of anger buster bear charg out of his hide place  he rush this way and that way  he roar with all his might  he was veri terribl to see  those who could fli  flew  those who could climb  climb  and

buster was alon  at least  he couldn  t see ani one   illustr  those who could fli  flew  those who could climb  climb  page 112    then he vent his temper on the tin pail  he cuf at it and pull at it  all the time growl angrili  he lay down and claw at it with his hind feet  at last the handl broke  and he was free  he shook himself  then he jump on the helpless pail  with a blow of a big paw he sent it clatter against a tree  he tri to bite it  then he onc more fell to knock it this way and that way  until it was pound flat  and no one would ever have guess that it had onc been a pail  then  and not till then  did buster recov his usual good natur  littl by littl  as he thought it all over  a look of shame crept into his face   i  i guess it wasn  t the fault of that thing  i ought to have known enough to keep my head out of it  he said slowli and thought   you got no more than you deserv for steal farmer brown  s boy  s berri  said sammi jay  who had come back and was look on from

  i  m mighti glad they are no wors  they  re not so bad  that is what farmer brown  s boy said when he found that buster bear had stolen the berri he had work so hard to pick and then had run off with the pail  you see  farmer brown  s boy is learn to be someth of a philosoph  one of those peopl who accept bad thing cheer and right away see how they are better than they might have been  when he had first heard some one in the bush where he had hidden his pail of berri  he had been veri sure that it was one of the cow or young cattl who live in the old pastur dure the summer  he had been afraid that they might stupid kick over the pail and spill the berri  and he had hurri to drive whoever it was away  it hadn  t enter his head that it could be anybodi who would eat those berri  when he had yell and buster bear had sudden appear  struggl to get off the pail which had caught over his head  farmer brown  s boy had been too frighten to even move  then he had seen buster tear away through the brush even more frighten than he was  and right away his courag had begun to come back   if he is so afraid of me  i guess i needn  t be afraid of him  said he   i  ve lost my berri  but it is worth it to find out that he is afraid of me  there are plenti more on the bush  and all i  ve got to do is to pick them  it might be wors  he walk over to the place where the pail had been  and then he rememb that when buster ran away he had carri the pail with him  hang about his neck  he whistl  it was a comic littl whistl of chagrin as he realiz that he had noth in which to put more berri  even if he pick them   it  s wors than i thought  cri he   that bear has cheat me out of that berri pie my mother promis me  then he began to laugh  as he thought of how funni buster bear had look with the pail about his neck  and then becaus  you know he is learn to be a philosoph  he onc more repeat   it might have been wors  yes  inde  it might have been wors  that bear might have tri to eat me instead of the berri  i guess i  ll go eat that lunch i left back by the spring  and then i  ll go home  i can pick berri some other day  chuckl happili over buster bear  s great fright  farmer brown  s boy tramp back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwich on a flat stone when he start to save his pail of berri   my  but those sandwich will tast good  thought he   i  m glad they are big and thick  i never was hungrier in my life  hello  this he exclaim right out loud  for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the sandwich should have been  and they were not there  no  sir  there wasn  t so much as a crumb left of those two thick sandwich  you see  old man coyot had found them and gobbl them up while farmer brown  s boy was away  but farmer brown  s boy didn  t know anyth about old man coyot  he rub his eye and stare everywher  even up in the tree  as if he thought those sandwich might be hang up there  they had disappear as complet as if they never had been  and old man coyot had taken care to leav no trace of his visit  farmer brown  s boy gape foolish this way and that way  then  instead of grow angri  a slow smile stole over his freckl face   i guess some one els was hungri too  he mutter   wonder who it was  guess this old pastur is no place for me to  day  i  ll fill up on berri and then i  ll go home  so farmer brown  s boy made his lunch on blueberri and then rather sheepish he start for home to tell of all the strang thing that had happen to him in the old pastur  two or three time  as he trudg along  he stop to scratch his head thought
