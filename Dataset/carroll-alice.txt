 alic  s adventur in wonderland by lewi carrol 1865  chapter i  down the rabbit  hole alic was begin to get veri tire of sit by her sister on the bank  and of have noth to do  onc or twice she had peep into the book her sister was read  but it had no pictur or convers in it   and what is the use of a book  thought alic  without pictur or convers  so she was consid in her own mind  as well as she could  for the hot day made her feel veri sleepi and stupid  whether the pleasur of make a daisi  chain would be worth the troubl of get up and pick the daisi  when sudden a white rabbit with pink eye ran close by her  there was noth so veri remark in that  nor did alic think it so veri much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself   oh dear  oh dear  i shall be late   when she thought it over afterward  it occur to her that she ought to have wonder at this  but at the time it all seem quit natur  but when the rabbit actual took a watch out of it waistcoat  pocket  and look at it  and then hurri on  alic start to her feet  for it flash across her mind that she had never befor seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat  pocket  or a watch to take out of it  and burn with curios  she ran across the field after it  and fortun was just in time to see it pop down a larg rabbit  hole under the hedg  in anoth moment down went alic after it  never onc consid how in the world she was to get out again  the rabbit  hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way  and then dip sudden down  so sudden that alic had not a moment to think about stop herself befor she found herself fall down a veri deep well  either the well was veri deep  or she fell veri slowli  for she had plenti of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was go to happen next  first  she tri to look down and make out what she was come to  but it was too dark to see anyth  then she look at the side of the well  and notic that they were fill with cupboard and book  shelv  here and there she saw map and pictur hung upon peg  she took down a jar from one of the shelv as she pass  it was label  orang marmalad  but to her great disappoint it was empti  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of kill somebodi  so manag to put it into one of the cupboard as she fell past it   well  thought alic to herself   after such a fall as this  i shall think noth of tumbl down stair  how brave they  ll all think me at home  whi  i wouldn  t say anyth about it  even if i fell off the top of the hous   which was veri like true  down  down  down  would the fall never come to an end   i wonder how mani mile i  ve fallen by this time  she said aloud   i must be get somewher near the centr of the earth  let me see  that would be four thousand mile down  i think   for  you see  alic had learnt sever thing of this sort in her lesson in the schoolroom  and though this was not a veri good opportun for show off her knowledg  as there was no one to listen to her  still it was good practic to say it over   yes  that  s about the right distanc  but then i wonder what latitud or longitud i  ve got to   alic had no idea what latitud was  or longitud either  but thought they were nice grand word to say  present she began again   i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth  how funni it  ll seem to come out among the peopl that walk with their head downward  the antipathi  i think   she was rather glad there was no one listen  this time  as it didn  t sound at all the right word   but i shall have to ask them what the name of the countri is  you know  pleas  ma  am  is this new zealand or australia   and she tri to curtsey as she spoke  fanci curtsey as you  re fall through the air  do you think you could manag it   and what an ignor littl girl she  ll think me for ask  no  it  ll never do to ask  perhap i shall see it written up somewher  down  down  down  there was noth els to do  so alic soon began talk again   dinah  ll miss me veri much to  night  i should think   dinah was the cat   i hope they  ll rememb her saucer of milk at tea  time  dinah my dear  i wish you were down here with me  there are no mice in the air  i  m afraid  but you might catch a bat  and that  s veri like a mous  you know  but do cat eat bat  i wonder  and here alic began to get rather sleepi  and went on say to herself  in a dreami sort of way   do cat eat bat  do cat eat bat  and sometim   do bat eat cat  for  you see  as she couldn  t answer either question  it didn  t much matter which way she put it  she felt that she was doze off  and had just begun to dream that she was walk hand in hand with dinah  and say to her veri earnest   now  dinah  tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat  when sudden  thump  thump  down she came upon a heap of stick and dri leav  and the fall was over  alic was not a bit hurt  and she jump up on to her feet in a moment  she look up  but it was all dark overhead  befor her was anoth long passag  and the white rabbit was still in sight  hurri down it  there was not a moment to be lost  away went alic like the wind  and was just in time to hear it say  as it turn a corner   oh my ear and whisker  how late it  s get  she was close behind it when she turn the corner  but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long  low hall  which was lit up by a row of lamp hang from the roof  there were door all round the hall  but they were all lock  and when alic had been all the way down one side and up the other  tri everi door  she walk sad down the middl  wonder how she was ever to get out again  sudden she came upon a littl three  leg tabl  all made of solid glass  there was noth on it except a tini golden key  and alic  s first thought was that it might belong to one of the door of the hall  but  ala  either the lock were too larg  or the key was too small  but at ani rate it would not open ani of them  howev  on the second time round  she came upon a low curtain she had not notic befor  and behind it was a littl door about fifteen inch high  she tri the littl golden key in the lock  and to her great delight it fit  alic open the door and found that it led into a small passag  not much larger than a rat  hole  she knelt down and look along the passag into the loveliest garden you ever saw  how she long to get out of that dark hall  and wander about among those bed of bright flower and those cool fountain  but she could not even get her head through the doorway   and even if my head would go through  thought poor alic   it would be of veri littl use without my shoulder  oh  how i wish i could shut up like a telescop  i think i could  if i onli know how to begin  for  you see  so mani out  of  the  way thing had happen late  that alic had begun to think that veri few thing inde were realli imposs  there seem to be no use in wait by the littl door  so she went back to the tabl  half hope she might find anoth key on it  or at ani rate a book of rule for shut peopl up like telescop  this time she found a littl bottl on it   which certain was not here befor  said alic  and round the neck of the bottl was a paper label  with the word  drink me  beauti print on it in larg letter  it was all veri well to say  drink me  but the wise littl alic was not go to do that in a hurri   no  i  ll look first  she said   and see whether it  s mark  poison  or not  for she had read sever nice littl histori about children who had got burnt  and eaten up by wild beast and other unpleas thing  all becaus they would not rememb the simpl rule their friend had taught them  such as  that a red  hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your finger veri deepli with a knife  it usual bleed  and she had never forgotten that  if you drink much from a bottl mark  poison  it is almost certain to disagre with you  sooner or later  howev  this bottl was not mark  poison  so alic ventur to tast it  and find it veri nice   it had  in fact  a sort of mix flavour of cherri  tart  custard  pine  appl  roast turkey  toffe  and hot butter toast  she veri soon finish it off                       what a curious feel  said alic   i must be shut up like a telescop  and so it was inde  she was now onli ten inch high  and her face brighten up at the thought that she was now the right size for go through the littl door into that love garden  first  howev  she wait for a few minut to see if she was go to shrink ani further  she felt a littl nervous about this   for it might end  you know  said alic to herself   in my go out altogeth  like a candl  i wonder what i should be like then  and she tri to fanci what the flame of a candl is like after the candl is blown out  for she could not rememb ever have seen such a thing  after a while  find that noth more happen  she decid on go into the garden at onc  but  ala for poor alic  when she got to the door  she found she had forgotten the littl golden key  and when she went back to the tabl for it  she found she could not possibl reach it  she could see it quit plain through the glass  and she tri her best to climb up one of the leg of the tabl  but it was too slipperi  and when she had tire herself out with tri  the poor littl thing sat down and cri   come  there  s no use in cri like that  said alic to herself  rather sharpli   i advis you to leav off this minut  she general gave herself veri good advic   though she veri seldom follow it  and sometim she scold herself so sever as to bring tear into her eye  and onc she rememb tri to box her own ear for have cheat herself in a game of croquet she was play against herself  for this curious child was veri fond of pretend to be two peopl   but it  s no use now  thought poor alic   to pretend to be two peopl  whi  there  s hard enough of me left to make one respect person  soon her eye fell on a littl glass box that was lie under the tabl  she open it  and found in it a veri small cake  on which the word  eat me  were beauti mark in currant   well  i  ll eat it  said alic   and if it make me grow larger  i can reach the key  and if it make me grow smaller  i can creep under the door  so either way i  ll get into the garden  and i don  t care which happen  she ate a littl bit  and said anxious to herself   which way  which way  hold her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was grow  and she was quit surpris to find that she remain the same size  to be sure  this general happen when one eat cake  but alic had got so much into the way of expect noth but out  of  the  way thing to happen  that it seem quit dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way  so she set to work  and veri soon finish off the cake                      chapter ii  the pool of tear  curious and curious  cri alic  she was so much surpris  that for the moment she quit forgot how to speak good english   now i  m open out like the largest telescop that ever was  good  bye  feet   for when she look down at her feet  they seem to be almost out of sight  they were get so far off   oh  my poor littl feet  i wonder who will put on your shoe and stock for you now  dear  i  m sure i shan  t be abl  i shall be a great deal too far off to troubl myself about you  you must manag the best way you can  but i must be kind to them  thought alic   or perhap they won  t walk the way i want to go  let me see  i  ll give them a new pair of boot everi christma  and she went on plan to herself how she would manag it   they must go by the carrier  she thought   and how funni it  ll seem  send present to one  s own feet  and how odd the direct will look  alic  s right foot  esq  hearthrug  near the fender   with alic  s love  oh dear  what nonsens i  m talk  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now more than nine feet high  and she at onc took up the littl golden key and hurri off to the garden door  poor alic  it was as much as she could do  lie down on one side  to look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cri again   you ought to be asham of yourself  said alic   a great girl like you   she might well say this   to go on cri in this way  stop this moment  i tell you  but she went on all the same  shed gallon of tear  until there was a larg pool all round her  about four inch deep and reach half down the hall  after a time she heard a littl patter of feet in the distanc  and she hastili dri her eye to see what was come  it was the white rabbit return  splendid dress  with a pair of white kid glove in one hand and a larg fan in the other  he came trot along in a great hurri  mutter to himself as he came   oh  the duchess  the duchess  oh  won  t she be savag if i  ve kept her wait  alic felt so desper that she was readi to ask help of ani one  so  when the rabbit came near her  she began  in a low  timid voic   if you pleas  sir  the rabbit start violent  drop the white kid glove and the fan  and skurri away into the dark as hard as he could go  alic took up the fan and glove  and  as the hall was veri hot  she kept fan herself all the time she went on talk   dear  dear  how queer everyth is to  day  and yesterday thing went on just as usual  i wonder if i  ve been chang in the night  let me think  was i the same when i got up this morn  i almost think i can rememb feel a littl differ  but if i  m not the same  the next question is  who in the world am i  ah  that  s the great puzzl  and she began think over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself  to see if she could have been chang for ani of them   i  m sure i  m not ada  she said   for her hair goe in such long ringlet  and mine doesn  t go in ringlet at all  and i  m sure i can  t be mabel  for i know all sort of thing  and she  oh  she know such a veri littl  besid  she  s she  and i  m i  and  oh dear  how puzzl it all is  i  ll tri if i know all the thing i use to know  let me see  four time five is twelv  and four time six is thirteen  and four time seven is  oh dear  i shall never get to twenti at that rate  howev  the multipl tabl doesn  t signifi  let  s tri geographi  london is the capit of pari  and pari is the capit of rome  and rome  no  that  s all wrong  i  m certain  i must have been chang for mabel  i  ll tri and say  how doth the littl  and she cross her hand on her lap as if she were say lesson  and began to repeat it  but her voic sound hoars and strang  and the word did not come the same as they use to do   how doth the littl crocodil improv his shine tail  and pour the water of the nile on everi golden scale   how cheer he seem to grin  how neat spread his claw  and welcom littl fish in with gentl smile jaw   i  m sure those are not the right word  said poor alic  and her eye fill with tear again as she went on   i must be mabel after all  and i shall have to go and live in that poki littl hous  and have next to no toy to play with  and oh  ever so mani lesson to learn  no  i  ve made up my mind about it  if i  m mabel  i  ll stay down here  it  ll be no use their put their head down and say  come up again  dear  i shall onli look up and say  who am i then  tell me that first  and then  if i like be that person  i  ll come up  if not  i  ll stay down here till i  m somebodi els  but  oh dear  cri alic  with a sudden burst of tear   i do wish they would put their head down  i am so veri tire of be all alon here  as she said this she look down at her hand  and was surpris to see that she had put on one of the rabbit  s littl white kid glove while she was talk   how can i have done that  she thought   i must be grow small again  she got up and went to the tabl to measur herself by it  and found that  as near as she could guess  she was now about two feet high  and was go on shrink rapid  she soon found out that the caus of this was the fan she was hold  and she drop it hastili  just in time to avoid shrink away altogeth   that was a narrow escap  said alic  a good deal frighten at the sudden chang  but veri glad to find herself still in exist   and now for the garden  and she ran with all speed back to the littl door  but  ala  the littl door was shut again  and the littl golden key was lie on the glass tabl as befor   and thing are wors than ever  thought the poor child   for i never was so small as this befor  never  and i declar it  s too bad  that it is  as she said these word her foot slip  and in anoth moment  splash  she was up to her chin in salt water  her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea   and in that case i can go back by railway  she said to herself   alic had been to the seasid onc in her life  and had come to the general conclus  that wherev you go to on the english coast you find a number of bath machin in the sea  some children dig in the sand with wooden spade  then a row of lodg hous  and behind them a railway station  howev  she soon made out that she was in the pool of tear which she had wept when she was nine feet high   i wish i hadn  t cri so much  said alic  as she swam about  tri to find her way out   i shall be punish for it now  i suppos  by be drown in my own tear  that will be a queer thing  to be sure  howev  everyth is queer to  day  just then she heard someth splash about in the pool a littl way off  and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus  but then she rememb how small she was now  and she soon made out that it was onli a mous that had slip in like herself   would it be of ani use  now  thought alic   to speak to this mous  everyth is so out  of  the  way down here  that i should think veri like it can talk  at ani rate  there  s no harm in tri  so she began   o mous  do you know the way out of this pool  i am veri tire of swim about here  o mous   alic thought this must be the right way of speak to a mous  she had never done such a thing befor  but she rememb have seen in her brother  s latin grammar   a mous  of a mous  to a mous  a mous  o mous  the mous look at her rather inquisit  and seem to her to wink with one of it littl eye  but it said noth   perhap it doesn  t understand english  thought alic   i daresay it  s a french mous  come over with william the conqueror   for  with all her knowledg of histori  alic had no veri clear notion how long ago anyth had happen  so she began again   ou est ma chatt  which was the first sentenc in her french lesson  book  the mous gave a sudden leap out of the water  and seem to quiver all over with fright   oh  i beg your pardon  cri alic hastili  afraid that she had hurt the poor anim  s feel   i quit forgot you didn  t like cat   not like cat  cri the mous  in a shrill  passion voic   would you like cat if you were me   well  perhap not  said alic in a sooth tone   don  t be angri about it  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think you  d take a fanci to

 and she is such a nice soft thing to nurs  and she  s such a capit one for catch mice  oh  i beg your pardon  cri alic again  for this time the mous was bristl all over  and she felt certain it must be realli offend   we won  t talk about her ani more if you  d rather not   we inde  cri the mous  who was trembl down to the end of his tail   as if i would talk on such a subject  our famili alway

when you throw them  and it  ll sit up and beg for it dinner  and all sort of thing  i can  t rememb half of them  and it belong to a farmer  you know  and he say it  s so use  it  s worth a hundr pound  he say it kill all the rat and  oh dear  cri alic in a sorrow tone   i  m afraid i  ve offend it again  for the mous was swim away from her as hard as it could go  and make quit a commot in the pool as it went  so she call soft after it   mous dear  do come back again  and we won  t talk about cat or dog either  if you don  t like them  when the mous heard this  it turn round and swam slowli back to her  it face was quit pale  with passion  alic thought  and it said in a low trembl voic   let us get to the shore  and then i  ll tell you my histori  and you  ll understand whi it is i hate cat and dog  it was high time to go  for the pool was get quit crowd with the bird and anim that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo  a lori and an eaglet  and sever other curious creatur  alic led the way  and the whole parti swam to the shore  chapter iii  a caucus  race and a long tale they were inde a queer  look parti that assembl on the bank  the bird with draggl feather  the anim with their fur cling close to them  and all drip wet  cross  and uncomfort  the first question of cours was  how to get dri again  they had a consult about this  and after a few minut it seem quit natur to alic to find herself talk familiar with them  as if she had known them all her life  inde  she had quit a long argument with the lori  who at last turn sulki  and would onli say   i am older than you  and must know better  and this alic would not allow without know how old it was  and  as the lori posit refus to tell it age  there was no more to be said  at last the mous  who seem to be a person of author among them  call out   sit down  all of you  and listen to me  i  ll soon make you dri enough  they all sat down at onc  in a larg ring  with the mous in the middl  alic kept her eye anxious fix on it  for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dri veri soon   ahem  said the mous with an import air   are you all readi  this is the driest thing i know  silenc all round  if you pleas   william the conqueror  whose caus was favour by the pope  was soon submit to by the english  who want leader  and had been of late much accustom to usurp and conquest  edwin and morcar  the earl of mercia and northumbria   ugh  said the lori  with a shiver   i beg your pardon  said the mous  frown  but veri polit   did you speak   not i  said the lori hastili   i

said the duck   found it  the mous repli rather crossli   of cours you know what  it  mean   i know what  it  mean well enough  when i find a thing  said the duck   it  s general a frog or a worm  the question is  what did the archbishop find  the mous did not notic this question  but hurri went on   found it advis to go with edgar athel to meet william and offer him the crown  william  s conduct at first was moder  but the insol of his norman  how are you get on now  my dear  it continu  turn to alic as it spoke   as wet as ever  said alic in a melancholi tone   it doesn  t seem to dri me at

those long word  and  what  s more  i don  t believ you do either  and the eaglet bent down it head to hide a smile  some of the other bird titter audibl   what i was go to say  said the dodo in an offend tone   was  that the best thing to get us dri would be a caucus  race   what is a caucus  race  said alic  not that she want much to know  but the dodo had paus as if it thought that somebodi ought to speak  and no one els seem inclin to say anyth   whi  said the dodo   the best way to explain it is to do it   and  as you might like to tri the thing yourself  some winter day  i will tell you how the dodo manag it  first it mark out a race  cours  in a sort of circl   the exact shape doesn  t matter  it said  and then all the parti were place along the cours  here and there  there was no  one  two  three  and away  but they began run when they like  and left off when they like  so that it was not easi to know when the race was over  howev  when they had been run half an hour or so  and were quit dri again  the dodo sudden call out  the race is over  and they all crowd round it  pant  and ask   but who has won  this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought  and it sat for a long time with one finger press upon it forehead  the posit in which you usual see shakespear  in the pictur of him  while the rest wait in silenc  at last the dodo said   everybodi has won  and all must have prize   but who is to give the prize  quit a chorus of voic ask   whi  she  of cours  said the dodo  point to alic with one finger  and the whole parti at onc crowd round her  call out in a confus way   prize  prize  alic had no idea what to do  and in despair she put her hand in her pocket  and pull out a box of comfit   luckili the salt water had not got

complain that they could not tast their  and the small one choke and had to be pat on the back  howev  it was over at last  and they sat down again in a ring  and beg the mous to tell them someth more

upon a neat littl hous  on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  w  rabbit  engrav upon it  she went in without knock  and hurri upstair  in great fear lest she should meet the real mari ann  and be turn out of the hous befor she had found the fan and glove   how queer it seem  alic said to herself   to be go messag for a rabbit  i suppos dinah  ll be send me on messag next  and she began fanci the sort of thing that would happen   miss alic  come here direct  and get readi for your walk   come in a minut  nurs  but i  ve got to see that the mous doesn  t get out  onli i don  t think  alic went on   that they  d let dinah stop in the hous if it began order peopl about like that  by this time she had found her way into a tidi littl room with a tabl in the window  and on it  as she had hope  a fan and two or three pair of tini white kid glove  she took up the fan and a pair of the glove  and was just go to leav the room  when her eye fell upon a littl bottl that stood near the look  glass  there was no label this time with the word  drink me  but nevertheless she uncork it and put it to her lip   i know someth interest is sure to happen  she said to herself   whenev i eat or drink anyth  so i  ll just see what this bottl doe  i do hope it  ll make me grow larg again  for realli i  m quit tire of be such a tini littl thing  it did so inde  and much sooner than she had expect  befor she had drunk half the bottl  she found her head press against the ceil  and had to stoop to save her neck from be broken  she hastili put down the bottl  say to herself  that  s quit enough  i hope i shan  t grow ani more  as it is  i can  t get out at the door  i do wish i hadn  t drunk quit so much  ala  it was too late to wish that  she went on grow  and grow  and veri soon had to kneel down on the floor  in anoth minut there was not even room for this  and she tri the effect of lie down with one elbow against the door  and the other arm curl round her head  still she went on grow  and  as a last resourc  she put one arm out of the window  and one foot up the chimney  and said to herself  now i can do no more  whatev happen  what will becom of me  luckili for alic  the littl magic bottl had now had it full effect  and she grew no larger  still it was veri uncomfort  and  as there seem to be no sort of chanc of her ever get out of the room again  no

and now here i am in the middl of one  there ought to be a book written about me  that there ought  and when i grow up  i  ll write one  but i  m grown up now  she ad in a sorrow tone   at least there  s no room to grow up ani more here   but then  thought alic   shall i never get ani older than i am now  that  ll be a comfort  one way  never to be an old woman  but then  alway to have lesson to learn  oh  i shouldn  t like that   oh  you foolish alic  she answer herself   how can you learn lesson in here  whi  there  s hard room for you  and no room at all for ani lesson  book  and so she went on  take first one side and then the other  and make quit a convers of it altogeth  but after a few minut she heard a voic outsid  and stop to listen   mari ann  mari ann  said the voic   fetch me my glove this moment  then came a littl patter of feet on the stair  alic knew it was the rabbit come to look for her  and she trembl till she shook the hous  quit forget that she was now about a thousand time as larg as the rabbit  and had no reason to be afraid of it  present the rabbit came up to the door  and tri to open it  but  as the door open inward  and alic  s elbow was press hard against it  that attempt prove a failur  alic heard it say to itself  then i  ll go round and get in at the window   that you won  t  thought alic  and  after wait till she fanci she heard the rabbit just under the window  she sudden spread out her hand  and made a snatch in the air  she did not get hold of anyth  but she heard a littl shriek and a fall  and a crash of broken glass  from which she conclud that it was just possibl it had fallen into a cucumb  frame  or someth of the sort  next came an angri voic  the rabbit  s  pat  pat  where are you  and then a voic she had never heard befor   sure then i  m here  dig for appl  yer honour   dig for appl  inde  said the rabbit angrili   here  come and help me out of this   sound of more broken glass   now tell me  pat  what  s that in the

all  at all   do as i tell you  you coward  and at last she spread out her hand again  and made anoth snatch in the air  this time there were two littl shriek  and more sound of broken glass   what a number of cucumb  frame there must be  thought alic   i wonder what they  ll do next  as for pull me out of the window  i onli wish they could  i  m sure i don  t want to stay in here ani longer  she wait for some time without hear anyth more  at last came a rumbl of littl cartwheel  and the sound of a good mani voic all talk togeth  she made out the word   where  s the other ladder  whi  i hadn  t to bring but one  bill  s got the other  bill  fetch it here  lad  here  put  em up at this corner  no  tie  em togeth first  they don  t reach half high enough yet  oh  they  ll do well enough  don

said alic to herself   shi  they seem to put everyth upon bill  i wouldn  t be in bill  s place for a good deal  this fireplac is narrow  to be sure  but i think i can kick a littl  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could  and wait till she heard a littl anim  she couldn  t guess of what sort it was  scratch and scrambl about in the chimney close abov her  then  say to herself  this is bill  she gave one sharp kick  and wait to see what would happen next  the first thing she heard was a general chorus of  there goe bill  then the rabbit  s voic along  catch him  you by the hedg  then silenc  and then anoth confus of voic  hold up his head  brandi now  don  t choke him  how was it  old fellow  what happen to you  tell us all about it  last came a littl feebl  squeak voic   that  s bill  thought alic   well  i hard know  no more  thank ye  i  m better now  but i  m a deal too fluster to tell you  all i know is  someth come at me like a jack  in  the  box  and up i goe like a sky  rocket   so you did  old fellow  said the other   we must burn the hous down  said the rabbit  s voic  and alic call out as loud as she could   if you do  i  ll set dinah at you  there was a dead silenc instant  and alic thought to herself   i wonder what they will do next  if they had ani sens  they  d take the roof off  after a minut or two  they began move about again  and alic heard the rabbit say   a barrow will do  to begin with   a barrow of what  thought alic  but she had not long to doubt  for the next moment a shower of littl pebbl came rattl in at the window  and some of them hit her in the face   i  ll put a stop to this  she said to herself  and shout out   you  d better not do that again  which produc anoth dead silenc  alic notic with some surpris that the pebbl were all turn into littl cake as they lay on the floor  and a bright idea came into her head   if i eat one of these cake  she thought   it  s sure to make some chang in my size  and as it can  t possibl make me larger  it must make me smaller  i suppos  so she swallow one of the cake  and was delight to find that she began shrink direct  as soon as she was small enough to get through the door  she ran out of the hous  and found quit a crowd of littl anim and bird wait outsid  the poor littl lizard  bill  was in the middl  be held up by two guinea  pig  who were give it someth out of a bottl  they all made a rush at alic the moment she appear  but she ran off as hard as she could  and soon found herself safe in a thick wood   the first thing i  ve got to do  said alic to herself  as she wander about in the wood   is to grow to my right size again  and the second thing is to find my way into that love garden  i think that will be the best plan  it sound an excel plan  no doubt  and veri neat and simpli arrang  the onli difficulti was  that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it  and while she was peer about anxious among the tree  a littl sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurri  an enorm puppi was look down at her with larg round eye  and feebli stretch out one paw  tri to touch her   poor littl thing  said alic  in a coax tone  and she tri hard to whistl to it  but she was terribl frighten all the time at the thought that it might be hungri  in which case it would be veri like to eat her up in spite of all her coax  hard know what she did  she pick up a littl bit of stick  and held it out to the puppi  whereupon the puppi jump into the air off all it feet at onc  with a yelp of delight  and rush at the stick  and made believ to worri it  then alic dodg behind a great thistl  to keep herself from be run over  and the moment she appear on the other side  the puppi made anoth rush at the stick  and tumbl head over heel in it hurri to get hold of it  then alic  think it was veri like have a game of play with a cart  hors  and expect everi moment to be trampl under it feet  ran round the thistl again  then the puppi began a seri of short charg at the stick  run a veri littl way forward each time and a long way back  and bark hoars all the while  till at last it sat down a good way off  pant  with it tongu hang out of it mouth  and it great eye half shut  this seem to alic a good opportun for make her escap  so she set off at onc  and ran till she was quit tire and out of breath  and till the puppi  s bark sound quit faint in the distanc   and yet what a dear littl puppi it was  said alic  as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself  and fan herself with one of the leav   i should have like teach it trick veri much  if  if i  d onli been the right size to do it  oh dear  i  d near forgotten that i  ve got to grow up again  let me see  how is it to be manag  i suppos i ought to eat or drink someth or other  but the great question is  what  the great question certain was  what  alic look all round her at the flower and the blade of grass  but she did not see anyth that look like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumst  there was a larg mushroom grow near her  about the same height as herself  and when she had look under it  and on both side of it  and behind it  it occur to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it  she stretch herself up on tipto  and peep over the edg of the mushroom  and her eye immedi met those of a larg caterpillar  that was sit on the top with it arm fold  quiet smoke a long hookah  and take not the smallest notic of her or of anyth els  chapter v  advic from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alic look at each other for some time in silenc  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth  and address her in a languid  sleepi voic   who are you  said the caterpillar  this was not an encourag open for a convers  alic repli  rather shyli   i  i hard know  sir  just at present  at least i know who i was when i got up this morn  but i think i must have been chang sever time sinc then   what do you mean by that

not a bit  said the caterpillar   well  perhap your feel may be differ  said alic   all i know is  it would feel veri queer to me   you  said the caterpillar contemptu   who are you  which brought them back again to the begin of the convers  alic felt a littl irrit at the caterpillar  s make such veri short remark  and she drew herself up and said  veri grave   i think  you ought to tell me who you are  first   whi  said the caterpillar  here was anoth puzzl question  and as alic could not think of ani good reason  and as the caterpillar seem to be in a veri unpleas state of mind  she turn away   come back  the caterpillar call after her   i  ve someth import to say  this sound promis  certain  alic turn and came back again   keep your temper  said the caterpillar   is that all  said alic  swallow down her anger as well as she could   no  said the caterpillar  alic thought she might as well wait  as she had noth els to do  and perhap after all it might tell her someth worth hear  for some minut it puf away without speak  but at last it unfold it arm  took the hookah out of it mouth again  and said   so you think you  re chang  do you   i  m afraid i am  sir  said alic   i can  t rememb thing as i use  and i don  t keep the same size for ten minut togeth   can  t rememb what thing  said the caterpillar   well  i  ve tri to say  how doth the littl busi bee  but it all came differ  alic repli in a veri melancholi voic   repeat   you are old  father william  said the caterpillar  alic fold her hand  and began   you are old  father william  the young man said   and your

got alter   it is wrong from begin to end  said the caterpillar decid  and there was silenc for some minut  the caterpillar was the first to speak   what size do you want to be  it ask   oh  i  m not particular as to size  alic hastili repli   onli one doesn  t like chang so often  you know   i don  t know  said the caterpillar  alic said noth  she had never been so much contradict in her life befor  and she felt that she was lose her temper   are you content now  said the caterpillar   well  i should like to be a littl larger  sir  if you wouldn  t mind  said alic   three inch is such a wretch height to be   it is a veri good height inde  said the caterpillar angrili  rear itself upright as it spoke  it was exact three inch high   but i  m not use to it  plead poor alic in a piteous tone  and she thought of herself   i wish the creatur wouldn  t be so easili offend   you  ll get use to it in time  said the caterpillar  and it put the hookah into it mouth and began smoke again  this time alic wait patient until it chose to speak again  in a minut or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of it mouth and yawn onc or twice  and shook itself  then it got down off the mushroom  and crawl away in the grass  mere remark as it went   one side will make you grow taller  and the other side will make you grow shorter   one side of what  the other side of what  thought alic to herself   of the mushroom  said the caterpillar  just as if she had ask it aloud  and in anoth moment it was out of sight  alic remain look thought at the mushroom for a minut  tri to make out which were the two side of it  and as it was perfect round  she found this a veri difficult question  howev  at last she stretch her arm round it as far as they would go  and broke off a bit of the edg with each hand   and now which is which  she said to herself  and nibbl a littl of the right  hand bit to tri the effect  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot  she was a good deal frighten by this veri sudden chang  but she felt that there was no time to be lost  as she was shrink rapid  so she set to work at onc to eat some of the other bit  her chin was press so close against her foot  that there was hard room to open her mouth  but she did it at last  and manag to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit                       come  my head  s free at last  said alic in a tone of delight  which chang into alarm in anoth moment  when she found that her shoulder were nowher to be found  all she could see  when she look down  was an immens length of neck  which seem to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leav that lay far below her   what can all that green stuff be  said alic   and where have my shoulder got to  and oh  my poor hand  how is it i can  t see you  she was move them about as she spoke  but no result seem to follow  except a littl shake among the distant green leav  as there seem to be no chanc of get her hand up to her head  she tri to get her head down to them  and was delight to find that her neck would bend about easili in ani direct  like a serpent  she had just succeed in curv it down into a grace zigzag  and was go to dive in among the leav  which she found to be noth but the top of the tree under which she had been wander  when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurri  a larg pigeon had flown into her face  and was beat her violent with it wing   serpent  scream the pigeon   i  m not a serpent  said alic indign   let me alon   serpent  i say again  repeat the pigeon  but in a more subdu tone  and ad with a kind of sob   i  ve tri everi way  and noth seem to suit them   i haven  t the least idea what you  re talk about  said alic   i  ve tri the root of tree  and i  ve tri bank  and i  ve tri hedg  the pigeon went on  without attend to her   but those serpent  there  s no pleas them  alic was more and more puzzl  but she thought there was no use in say anyth more till the pigeon had finish   as if it wasn  t troubl enough hatch the egg  said the pigeon   but i must be on the look  out for serpent night and day  whi  i haven  t had a wink of sleep these three week   i  m veri sorri you  ve been annoy  said alic  who was begin to see it mean   and just as i  d taken the highest tree in the wood  continu the pigeon  rais it voic to a shriek   and just as i was think i should be free of them at last  they must need come wriggl down from the sky  ugh  serpent   but i  m not a serpent  i tell you  said alic   i  m a  i  m a   well  what are you  said the pigeon   i can see you  re tri to invent someth   i  i  m a littl girl  said alic  rather doubt  as she rememb the number of chang she had gone through that day   a like stori inde  said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt   i  ve seen a good mani littl girl in my time  but never one with such a neck as that  no  no  you  re a serpent  and there  s no use deni it  i suppos you  ll be tell me next that you never tast an egg   i have tast egg  certain  said alic  who was a veri truth child   but littl girl eat egg quit as much as serpent do  you know   i don  t believ it  said the pigeon   but if they do  whi then they  re a kind of serpent  that  s all i can say  this was such a new idea to alic  that she was quit silent for a minut or two  which gave the pigeon the opportun of ad   you  re look for egg  i know that well enough  and what doe it matter to me whether you  re a littl girl or a serpent   it matter a good deal to me  said alic hastili   but i  m not look for egg  as it happen  and if i was  i shouldn  t want your  i don  t like them raw   well  be off  then  said the pigeon in a sulki tone  as it settl down again into it nest  alic crouch down among the tree as well as she could  for her neck kept get entangl among the branch  and everi now and then she had to stop and untwist it  after a while she rememb that she still held the piec of mushroom in her hand  and she set to work veri care  nibbl first at one and then at the other  and grow sometim taller and sometim shorter  until she had succeed in bring herself down to her usual height  it was so long sinc she had been anyth near the right size  that it felt quit strang at first  but she got use to it in a few minut  and began talk to herself  as usual   come  there  s half my plan done now  how puzzl all these chang are  i  m never sure what i  m go to be  from one minut to anoth  howev  i  ve got back to my right size  the next thing is  to get into that beauti garden  how is that to be done  i wonder  as she said this  she came sudden upon an open place  with a littl hous in it about four feet high   whoever live there  thought alic   it  ll never do to come upon them this size  whi  i should frighten them out of their wit  so she began nibbl at the righthand bit again  and did not ventur to go near the hous till she had brought herself down to nine inch high  chapter vi  pig and pepper for a minut or two she stood look at the hous  and wonder what to do next  when sudden a footman in liveri came run out of the wood  she consid him to be a footman becaus he was in liveri  otherwis  judg by his face onli  she would have call him a fish  and rap loud at the door with his knuckl  it was open by anoth footman in liveri  with a round face  and larg eye like a frog  and both footmen  alic notic  had powder hair that curl all over their head  she felt veri curious to know what it was all about  and crept a littl way out of the wood to listen  the fish  footman began by produc from under his arm a great letter  near as larg as himself  and this he hand over to the other  say  in a solemn tone   for the duchess  an invit from the queen to play croquet  the frog  footman repeat  in the same solemn tone  onli chang the order of the word a littl   from the queen  an invit for the duchess to play croquet  then they both bow low  and their curl got entangl togeth  alic laugh so much at this  that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hear her  and when she next peep out the fish  footman was gone  and the other was sit on the ground near the door  stare stupid up into the sky  alic went timid up to the door  and knock   there  s no sort of use in knock  said the footman   and that for two reason  first  becaus i  m on the same side of the door as you are  second  becaus they  re make such a nois insid  no one could possibl hear you  and certain there was a most extraordinari nois go on within  a constant howl and sneez  and everi now and then a great crash  as if a dish or kettl had been broken to piec   pleas  then  said alic   how am i to get in   there might be some sens in your knock  the footman went on without attend to her   if we had the door between us  for instanc  if you were insid  you might knock  and i could let you out  you know  he was look up into the sky all the time he was speak  and this alic thought decid uncivil   but perhap he can  t help it  she said to herself   his eye are so veri near at the top of his head  but at ani rate he might answer question  how am i to get in  she repeat  aloud   i shall sit here  the footman remark   till tomorrow  at this moment the door of the hous open  and a larg plate came skim out  straight at the footman  s head  it just graze his nose  and broke to piec against one of the tree behind him   or next day  mayb  the footman continu in the same tone  exact as if noth had happen   how am i to get in  ask alic again  in a louder tone   are you to get in at all  said the footman   that  s the first question  you know  it was  no doubt  onli alic did not like to be told so   it  s realli dread  she mutter to herself   the way all the creatur argu  it  s enough to drive one crazi  the footman seem to think this a good opportun for repeat his remark  with variat   i shall sit here  he said   on and off  for day and day   but what am i to do  said alic   anyth you like  said the footman  and began whistl   oh  there  s no use in talk to him  said alic desper   he  s perfect idiot  and she open the door and went in  the door led right into a larg kitchen  which was full of smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sit on a three  leg stool in the middl  nurs a babi  the cook was lean over the fire  stir a larg cauldron which seem to be full of soup   there  s certain too much pepper in that soup  alic said to herself  as well as she could for sneez  there was certain too much of it in the air  even the duchess sneez occasion  and as for the babi  it was sneez and howl altern without a moment  s paus  the onli thing in the kitchen that did not sneez  were the cook  and a larg cat which was sit on the hearth and grin from ear to ear   pleas would you tell me  said alic  a littl timid  for she was not quit sure whether it was good manner for her to speak first   whi your cat grin like that   it  s a cheshir cat  said the duchess   and that  s whi  pig  she said the last word with such sudden violenc that alic quit jump  but she saw in anoth moment that it was address to the babi  and not to her  so she took courag  and went on again   i didn  t know that cheshir cat alway grin  in fact  i didn  t know that cat could grin   they all can  said the duchess   and most of  em do   i don  t know of ani that do  alic said veri polit  feel quit pleas to have got into a convers   you don  t know much  said the duchess   and that  s a fact  alic did not at all like the tone of this remark  and thought it would be as well to introduc some other subject of convers  while she was tri to fix on one  the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire  and at onc set to work throw everyth within her reach at the duchess and the babi  the fire  iron came first  then follow a shower of saucepan  plate  and dish  the duchess took no notic of them even when they hit her  and the babi was howl so much alreadi  that it was quit imposs to say whether the blow hurt it or not   oh  pleas mind what you  re do  cri alic  jump up and down in an agoni of terror   oh  there goe his precious nose  as an unusu larg saucepan flew close by it  and veri near carri it off   if everybodi mind their own busi  the duchess said in a hoars growl   the world would go round a deal faster than it doe   which would not be an advantag  said alic  who felt veri glad to get an opportun of show off a littl of her knowledg   just think of what work it would make with the day and night  you see the earth take twenti  four hour to turn round on it axi   talk of axe  said the duchess   chop off her head  alic glanc rather anxious at the cook  to see if she meant to take the hint  but the cook was busili stir the soup  and seem not to be listen  so she went on again   twenti  four hour  i think  or is it twelv  i   oh  don  t bother me  said the duchess   i never could abid figur  and with that she began nurs her child again  sing a sort of lullabi to it as she did so  and give it a violent shake at the end of everi line   speak rough to your littl boy  and beat him when he sneez  he onli doe it to annoy  becaus he know it teas  chorus   in which the cook and the babi join   wow  wow  wow  while the duchess sang the second vers of the song  she kept toss the babi violent up and down  and the poor littl thing howl so  that alic could hard hear the word   i speak sever to my boy  i beat him when he sneez  for he can thorough enjoy the pepper when he pleas  chorus   wow  wow  wow   here  you may nurs it a bit  if you like  the duchess said to alic  fling the babi at her as she spoke   i must go and get readi to play croquet with the queen  and she hurri out of the room  the cook threw a fri  pan after her as she went out  but it just miss her  alic caught the babi with some difficulti  as it was a queer  shape littl creatur  and held out it arm and leg in all direct   just like a star  fish  thought alic  the poor littl thing was snort like a steam  engin when she caught it  and kept doubl itself up and straighten itself out again  so that altogeth  for the first minut or two  it was as much as she could do to hold it  as soon as she had made out the proper way of nurs it   which was to twist it up into a sort of knot  and then keep tight hold of it right ear and left foot  so as to prevent it undo itself  she carri it out into the open air   if i don  t take this child away with me  thought alic   they  re sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldn  t it be murder to leav it behind  she said the last word out loud  and the littl thing grunt in repli  it had left off sneez by this time   don  t grunt  said alic   that  s not at all a proper way of express yourself  the babi grunt again  and alic look veri anxious into it face to see what was the matter with it  there could be no doubt that it had a veri turn  up nose  much more like a snout than a real nose  also it eye were get extrem small for a babi  altogeth alic did not like the look of the thing at all   but perhap it was onli sob  she thought  and look into it eye again  to see if there were ani tear  no  there were no tear   if you  re go to turn into a pig  my dear  said alic  serious   i  ll have noth more to do with you  mind now  the poor littl thing sob again  or grunt  it was imposs to say which  and they went on for some while in silenc  alic was just begin to think to herself   now  what am i to do with this creatur when i get it home  when it grunt again  so violent  that she look down into it face in some alarm  this time there could be no mistak about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig  and she felt that it would be quit absurd for her to carri it further  so she set the littl creatur down  and felt quit reliev to see it trot away quiet into the wood   if it had grown up  she said to herself   it would have made a dread ugli child  but it make rather a handsom pig  i think  and she began think over other children she knew  who might do veri well as pig  and was just say to herself   if one onli knew the right way to chang them  when she was a littl startl by see the cheshir cat sit on a bough of a tree a few yard off  the cat onli grin when it saw alic  it look good  natur  she thought  still it had veri long claw and a great mani teeth  so she felt that it ought to be treat with respect   cheshir puss  she began  rather timid  as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  howev  it onli grin a littl wider   come  it  s pleas so far  thought alic  and she went on   would you tell me  pleas  which way i ought to go from here   that depend a good deal on where you want to get to  said the cat   i don  t much care where  said alic   then it doesn  t matter which way you go  said the cat   so long as i get somewher  alic ad as an explan   oh  you  re sure to do that  said the cat   if you onli walk long enough  alic felt that this could not be deni  so she tri anoth question   what sort of peopl live about here   in that direct  the cat said  wave it right paw round   live a hatter  and in that direct  wave the other paw   live a march hare  visit either you like  they  re both mad   but i don  t want to go among mad peopl  alic remark   oh  you can  t help that  said the cat   we  re all mad here  i  m mad  you  re mad   how do you know i  m mad

  a dog  s not mad  you grant that   i suppos so  said alic   well  then  the cat went on   you see  a dog growl when it  s angri  and wag it tail when it  s pleas  now i growl when i  m pleas  and

natur way   i thought it would  said the cat  and vanish again  alic wait a littl  half expect to see it again  but it did not appear  and after a minut or two she walk on in the direct in which the march hare was said to live   i  ve seen hatter befor  she said to herself   the march hare will be much the most interest  and perhap as this is may it won  t be rave mad  at least not so mad as it

the rest of it had gone   well  i  ve often seen a cat without a grin  thought alic   but a grin without a cat  it  s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life  she had not gone much farther befor she came in sight of the hous of the march hare  she thought it must be the right hous  becaus the chimney were shape like ear and the roof was thatch with fur  it was so larg a hous  that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbl some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom  and rais herself to about two feet high  even then she walk up toward it rather timid  say to herself  suppos it should be rave mad after all  i almost wish i  d gone to see the hatter instead  chapter vii  a mad tea  parti there was a tabl set out under a tree in front of the hous  and the march hare and the hatter were have tea at it  a dormous was sit between them  fast asleep  and the other two were use it as a cushion  rest their elbow on it  and talk over it head   veri uncomfort for the dormous  thought alic   onli  as it  s asleep  i suppos it doesn  t mind  the tabl was a larg one  but the three were all crowd togeth at one corner of it   no room  no room  they cri out when they saw alic come

hear this  but all he said was   whi is a raven like a write  desk   come  we shall have some fun now  thought alic   i  m glad they  ve begun ask riddl  i believ i can guess that  she ad aloud   do

you might just as well say  ad the march hare   that  i like what i get  is the same thing as  i get what i like   you might just as well say  ad the dormous  who seem to be talk in his sleep   that  i breath when i sleep  is the same thing as  i sleep when i breath   it is the same thing with you  said the hatter  and here the convers drop  and the parti sat silent for a minut  while alic thought over all she could rememb about raven and write  desk  which wasn  t much  the hatter was the first to break the silenc   what day of the month is it  he said  turn to alic  he had taken his watch out of his pocket  and was look at it uneasili  shake it everi now and then  and hold it to his ear  alic consid a littl  and then said  the fourth   two day wrong  sigh the hatter   i told you butter wouldn  t suit the work  he ad look angrili at the march hare   it was the best butter  the march hare meek repli   yes  but some crumb must have got in as well  the hatter grumbl   you shouldn  t have put it in with the bread  knife  the march hare took the watch and look at it gloomili  then he dip it into his cup of tea  and look at it again  but he could think of noth better to say than his first remark   it was the best butter  you know  alic had been look over his shoulder with some curios   what a funni watch  she remark   it tell the day of the month  and doesn  t tell what o  clock it is   whi should it  mutter the hatter   doe your watch tell you what year it is   of cours not  alic repli veri readili   but that  s becaus it stay the same year for such a long time togeth

a good deal wors off than befor  as the march hare had just upset the milk  jug into his plate  alic did not wish to offend the dormous again  so she began veri cautious   but i don  t understand

against each other  howev  they got settl down in a minut or two  and the game began  alic thought she had never seen such a curious croquet  ground in her life  it was all ridg and furrow  the ball were live hedgehog  the mallet live flamingo  and the soldier had to doubl themselv up and to stand on their hand and feet  to make the arch  the chief difficulti alic found at first was in manag her flamingo  she succeed in get it bodi tuck away  comfort enough  under her arm  with it leg hang down  but general  just as she had got it neck nice straighten out  and was go to give the hedgehog a blow with it head  it would twist itself round and look up in her face  with such a puzzl express that she could not help burst out laugh  and when she had got it head down  and was go to begin again  it was veri provok to find that the hedgehog had unrol itself  and was in the act of crawl away  besid all this  there was general a ridg or furrow in the way wherev she want to send the hedgehog to  and  as the doubl  up soldier were alway get up and walk off to other part of the ground  alic soon came to the conclus that it was a veri difficult game inde  the player all play at onc without wait for turn  quarrel all the while  and fight for the hedgehog  and in a veri short time the queen was in a furious passion  and went stamp about  and shout  off with his head  or  off with her head  about onc in a minut  alic began to feel veri uneasi  to be sure  she had not as yet had ani disput with the queen  but she knew that it might happen ani minut   and then  thought she   what would becom of me  they  re dread fond of behead peopl here  the great wonder is  that there  s ani one left aliv  she was look about for some way of escap  and wonder whether she could get away without be seen  when she notic a curious appear in the air  it puzzl her veri much at first  but  after watch it a minut or two  she made it out to be a grin  and she said to herself  it  s the cheshir cat  now i shall have somebodi to talk to   how are you get on  said the cat  as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with  alic wait till the eye appear  and then nod   it  s no use speak to it  she thought   till it ear have come  or at least one of them  in anoth minut the whole head appear  and then alic put down her flamingo  and began an account of the game  feel veri glad she had someon to listen to her  the cat seem to think that there was enough of it now in sight  and no more of it appear   i don  t think they play at all fair  alic began  in rather a complain tone   and they all quarrel so dread one can  t hear oneself speak  and they don  t seem to have ani rule in particular  at least  if there are  nobodi attend to them  and you  ve no idea how confus it is all the thing be aliv  for instanc  there  s the arch i  ve got to go through next walk about at the other end of the ground  and i should have croquet the queen  s hedgehog just now  onli it ran away when it saw mine come   how do you like the queen  said the cat in a low voic   not at all  said alic   she  s so extrem  just then she notic that the queen was close behind her  listen  so she went on   like to win  that it  s hard worth while finish the game  the queen smile and pass on   who are you talk to  said the king  go up to alic  and look at the cat  s head with great curios   it  s a friend of mine  a cheshir cat  said alic   allow me to introduc it   i don  t like the look of it at all  said the king   howev  it may kiss my hand if it like   i  d rather not  the cat remark   don  t be impertin  said the king   and don  t look at me like that  he got behind alic as he spoke   a cat may look at a king  said alic   i  ve read that in some book  but i don  t rememb where   well  it must be remov  said the king veri decid  and he call the queen  who was pass at the moment   my dear  i wish you would have this cat remov  the queen had onli one way of settl all difficulti  great or small   off with his head  she said  without even look round   i  ll fetch the execution myself  said the king eager  and he hurri off  alic thought she might as well go back  and see how the game was go on  as she heard the queen  s voic in the distanc  scream with passion  she had alreadi heard her sentenc three of the player to be execut for have miss their turn  and she did not like the look of thing at all  as the game was in such confus that she never knew whether it was her turn or not  so she went in search of her hedgehog  the hedgehog was engag in a fight with anoth hedgehog  which seem to alic an excel opportun for croquet one of them with the other  the onli difficulti was  that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden  where alic could see it tri in a helpless sort of way to fli up into a tree  by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back  the fight was over  and both the hedgehog were out of sight   but it doesn  t matter much  thought alic   as all the arch are gone from this side of the ground  so she tuck it away under her arm  that it might not escap again  and went back for a littl more convers with her friend  when she got back to the cheshir cat  she was surpris to find quit a larg crowd collect round it  there was a disput go on between the execution  the king  and the queen  who were all talk at onc  while all the rest were quit silent  and look veri uncomfort  the moment alic appear  she was appeal to by all three to settl the question  and they repeat their argument to her  though  as they all spoke at onc  she found it veri hard inde to make out exact what they said  the execution  s argument was  that you couldn  t cut off a head unless there was a bodi to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing befor  and he wasn  t go to begin at his time of life  the king  s argument was  that anyth that had a head could be behead  and that you weren  t to talk nonsens  the queen  s argument was  that if someth wasn  t done about it in less than no time she  d have everybodi execut  all round   it was this last remark that had made the whole parti look so grave and anxious  alic could think of noth els to say but  it belong to the duchess  you  d better ask her about it   she  s in prison  the queen said to the execution   fetch her here  and the execution went off like an arrow  the cat  s head began fade away the moment he was gone  and  by the time he had come back with the duchess  it had entir disappear  so the king and the execution ran wild up and down look for it  while the rest of the parti went back to the game  chapter ix  the mock turtl  s stori  you can  t think how glad i am to see you again  you dear old thing  said the duchess  as she tuck her arm affection into alic  s  and they walk off togeth  alic was veri glad to find her in such a pleasant temper  and thought to herself that perhap it was onli the pepper that had made her so savag when they met in the kitchen   when i  m a duchess  she said to herself   not in a veri hope tone though   i won  t have ani pepper in my kitchen at all  soup doe veri well without  mayb it  s alway pepper that make peopl hot  temper  she went on  veri much pleas at have found out a new kind of rule   and vinegar that make them sour  and camomil that make them bitter  and  and barley  sugar and such thing that make children sweet  temper  i onli wish peopl knew that  then they wouldn  t be so stingi about it  you know  she had quit forgotten the duchess by this time  and was a littl startl when she heard her voic close to her ear   you  re think about someth  my dear  and that make you forget to talk  i can  t tell you just now what the moral of that is  but i shall rememb it in a bit   perhap it hasn  t one  alic ventur to remark   tut  tut  child  said the duchess   everyth  s got a moral  if onli you can find it  and she squeez herself up closer to alic  s side as she spoke  alic did not much like keep so close to her  first  becaus the duchess was veri ugli  and second  becaus she was exact the right height to rest her chin upon alic  s shoulder  and it was an uncomfort sharp chin  howev  she did not like to be rude  so she bore it as well as she could   the game  s go on rather better now  she said  by way of keep up the convers a littl   tis so  said the duchess   and the moral of that is  oh   tis love   tis love  that make the world go round   somebodi said  alic whisper   that it  s done by everybodi mind their own busi   ah  well  it mean much the same thing  said the duchess  dig her sharp littl chin into alic  s shoulder as she ad   and the moral of that is  take care of the sens  and the sound will take care of themselv   how fond she is of find moral in thing  alic thought to herself   i dare say you  re wonder whi i don  t put my arm round your waist  the duchess said after a paus   the reason is  that i  m doubt about the temper of your flamingo  shall i tri the experi   he might bite  alic cautious repli  not feel at all anxious to have the experi tri   veri true  said the duchess   flamingo and mustard both bite  and the moral of that is  bird of a feather flock togeth   onli mustard isn  t a bird  alic remark   right  as usual  said the duchess   what a clear way you have of put thing   it  s a miner  i think  said alic   of cours it is  said the duchess  who seem readi to agre to everyth that alic said   there  s a larg mustard  mine near here  and the moral of that is  the more there is of mine  the less there is of your   oh  i know  exclaim alic  who had not attend to this last remark   it  s a veget  it doesn  t look like one  but it is   i quit agre with you  said the duchess   and the moral of that is  be what you would seem to be  or if you  d like it put more simpli  never imagin yourself not to be otherwis than what it might appear to other that what you were or might have been was not otherwis than what you had been would have appear to them to be otherwis   i think i should understand that better  alic said veri polit   if i had it written down  but i can  t quit follow it as you say it   that  s noth to what i could say if i chose  the duchess repli  in a pleas tone   pray don  t troubl yourself to say it ani longer than that  said alic   oh  don  t talk about troubl  said the duchess   i make you a present of everyth i  ve said as yet   a cheap sort of present  thought alic   i  m glad they don  t give birthday present like that  but she did not ventur to say it out loud   think again  the duchess ask  with anoth dig of her sharp littl chin   i  ve a right to think  said alic sharpli  for she was begin to feel a littl worri   just about as much right  said the duchess   as pig have to fli  and the m  but here  to alic  s great surpris  the duchess  s voic die away  even in the middl of her favourit word  moral  and the arm that was link into her began to trembl  alic look up  and there stood the queen in front of them  with her arm fold  frown like a thunderstorm   a fine day  your majesti  the duchess began in a low  weak voic   now  i give you fair warn  shout the queen  stamp on the ground as she spoke   either you or your head must be off  and that in about half no time  take your choic  the duchess took her choic  and was gone in a moment   let  s go on with the game  the queen said to alic  and alic was too much frighten to say a word  but slowli follow her back to the croquet  ground  the other guest had taken advantag of the queen  s absenc  and were rest in the shade  howev  the moment they saw her  they hurri back to the game  the queen mere remark that a moment  s delay would cost them their live  all the time they were play the queen never left off quarrel with the other player  and shout  off with his head  or  off with her head  those whom she sentenc were taken into custodi by the soldier  who of cours had to leav off be arch to do this  so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arch left  and all the player  except the king  the queen  and alic  were in custodi and under sentenc of execut  then the queen left off  quit out of breath  and said to alic   have you seen the mock turtl yet   no  said alic   i don  t even know what a mock turtl is   it  s the thing mock turtl soup is made from  said the queen   i never saw one  or heard of one  said alic   come on  then  said the queen   and he shall tell you his histori  as they walk off togeth  alic heard the king say in a low voic  to the compani general   you are all pardon   come  that  s a good thing  she said to herself  for she had felt quit unhappi at the number of execut the queen had order  they veri soon came upon a gryphon  lie fast asleep in the sun   if you don  t know what a gryphon is  look at the pictur   up  lazi thing  said the queen   and take this young ladi to see the mock turtl  and to hear his histori  i must go back and see after some execut i have order  and she walk off  leav alic alon with the gryphon  alic did not quit like the look of the creatur  but on the whole she thought it would be quit as safe to stay with it as to go after that savag queen  so she wait  the gryphon sat up and rub it eye  then it watch the queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckl   what fun  said the gryphon  half to itself  half to alic   what is the fun  said alic   whi  she  said the gryphon   it  s all her fanci  that  they never execut nobodi  you know  come on   everybodi say  come on  here  thought alic  as she went slowli after it   i never was so order about in all my life  never  they had not gone far befor they saw the mock turtl in the distanc  sit sad and lone on a littl ledg of rock  and  as they came nearer  alic could hear him sigh as if his heart would break  she piti him deepli   what is his sorrow  she ask the gryphon  and the gryphon answer  veri near in the same word as befor   it  s all his fanci  that  he hasn  t got no sorrow  you know  come on  so they went up to the mock turtl  who look at them with larg eye full of tear  but said noth   this here young ladi  said the gryphon   she want for to know your histori  she do   i  ll tell it her  said the mock turtl in a deep  hollow tone   sit down  both of you  and don  t speak a word till i  ve finish  so they sat down  and nobodi spoke for some minut  alic thought to herself   i don  t see how he can even finish  if he doesn  t begin  but she wait patient   onc  said the mock turtl at last  with a deep sigh   i was a real turtl  these

taught us  said the mock turtl angrili   realli you are veri dull   you ought to be asham of yourself for ask such a simpl question  ad the gryphon  and then they both sat silent and look at poor alic  who felt readi to sink into the earth  at last the gryphon said to the mock turtl   drive on  old fellow  don  t be all day about it  and he went on in these word   yes  we went to school in the sea

come to the end  then stop  these were the vers the white rabbit read   they told me you had been to her  and mention me to him  she gave me a good charact  but said i could not swim  he sent them

though they were mine befor  if i or she should chanc to be involv in this affair  he trust to you to set them free  exact as we were  my notion was that you had been  befor she had this fit  an obstacl that came between him  and ourselv  and it  don  t let him know she like them best  for this must ever be a secret  kept from all the rest  between yourself and me   that  s the most import piec of evid we  ve heard yet  said the king  rub his hand   so now let the juri   if ani one of them can explain it  said alic   she had grown so larg in the last few minut that she wasn  t a bit afraid of interrupt him   i  ll give him sixpenc  i don  t believ there  s an atom of mean in it  the juri all wrote down on their slate   she doesn  t believ there  s an atom of mean in it  but none

move   who care for you  said alic   she had grown to her full size by this time   you  re noth but a pack of card  at this the whole pack rose up into the air  and came fli down upon her  she gave a littl scream  half of fright and half of anger  and tri to beat them off  and found herself lie on the bank  with her head in the lap of her sister  who was gentl brush away some dead leav that had flutter down from the tree upon her face   wake up  alic dear  said her sister   whi  what a long sleep you  ve had   oh  i  ve had such a curious dream  said alic  and she told her sister  as well as

as the white rabbit hurri by  the frighten mous splash his way through the neighbour pool  she could hear the rattl of the teacup as the march hare and his friend share their never  end meal  and the shrill voic of the queen order off her unfortun guest to execut  onc more the pig  babi was sneez on the duchess  s knee  while plate and dish crash around it  onc more the shriek of the gryphon  the squeak of the lizard  s slate  pencil  and the choke of the suppress guinea  pig  fill the air  mix up with the distant sob of the miser mock turtl  so she sat on  with close eye  and half believ herself in wonderland  though she knew she had but to open them again  and all would chang to dull realiti  the grass would be onli rustl in the wind  and the pool rippl to the wave of the reed  the rattl teacup would chang to tinkl sheep  bell  and the queen  s shrill cri to the voic of the shepherd boy  and the sneez of the babi  the shriek of the gryphon  and all the other queer nois  would chang  she knew  to the confus clamour of the busi farm  yard  while the low of the cattl in the distanc would take the place of the mock turtl  s heavi sob  last  she pictur to herself how this same littl sister of her would  in the after  time  be herself a grown woman  and how she would keep  through all her riper year  the simpl and love heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other littl children  and make their eye bright and eager with mani a strang tale  perhap even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simpl sorrow  and find a pleasur in all their simpl joy  rememb her own child  life  and the happi summer day
