old bulrush root for my paw  i hope you  ll find it veri tender  the old allig was hidden away beneath the mud and bulrush leav  and he couldn  t see anyth  he thought   pshaw  i  ve made a mistak  so he open his mouth and let the littl jackal go  the littl jackal ran away as fast as he could  and as he ran he call out   thank you  mr allig  kind mr allig  so kind of you to let me go  the old allig lash with his tail and snap with his jaw  but it was too late  the littl jackal was out of reach  after this the littl jackal kept away from the river  out of danger  but after about a week he got such an appetit for crab that noth els would do at all  he felt that he must have a crab  so he went down by the river and look all around  veri care  he didn  t see the old allig  but he thought to himself   i think i  ll not take ani chanc  so he stood still and began to talk out loud to himself  he said   when i don  t see ani littl crab on the land i general see them stick out of the water  and then i put my paw in and catch them  i wonder if there are ani fat littl crab in the water to  day  the old allig was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river  and when he heard what the littl jackal said  he thought   aha  i  ll pretend to be a littl crab  and when he put his paw in  i  ll make my dinner of him  so he stuck the black end of his snout abov the water and wait  the littl jackal took one look  and then he said   thank you  mr allig  kind mr allig  you are exceedingly kind to show me where you are  i will have dinner elsewher  and he ran away like the wind  the old allig foam at the mouth  he was so angri  but the littl jackal was gone  for two whole week the littl jackal kept away from the river  then  one day he got a feel insid him that noth but crab could satisfi  he felt that he must have at least one crab  veri cautious  he went down to the river and look all around  he saw no sign of the old allig  still  he did not mean to take ani chanc  so he stood quit still and began to talk to himself  it was a littl way he had  he said   when i don  t see ani littl crab on the shore  or stick up out of the water  i usual see them blow bubbl from

where i can get it  so he blew  and he blew  a mighti blast  and the bubbl rose in a perfect whirlpool  fizz and swirl  the littl jackal didn  t have to be told who was underneath those bubbl  he took one quick look  and off he ran  but as he went  he sang   thank you  mr allig  kind mr allig  you are the kindest allig in the world  to show me where you are  so nice  i  ll breakfast at anoth part of the river  the old allig was so furious that he crawl up on the bank and went after the littl jackal  but  dear  dear  he couldn  t catch the littl jackal  he ran far too fast  after this  the littl jackal did not like to risk go near the water  so he ate no more crab  but he found a garden of wild fig  which were so good that he went there everi day  and ate them instead of shell  fish  now the old allig found this out  and he made up his mind to have the littl jackal for supper  or to die tri  so he crept  and crawl  and drag himself over the ground to the garden of wild fig  there he made a huge pile of fig under the biggest of the wild fig tree  and hid himself in the pile  after a while the littl jackal came danc into the garden  veri happi and free from care  but look all around  he saw the huge pile of fig under the big fig tree   h  m  he thought   that look singular like my friend  the allig  i  ll investig a bit  he stood quit still and began to talk to himself  it

great heap of fig over there is so still that i think they must be all bad fig  the old allig  underneath his fig pile  thought   bother the suspici littl jackal  i shall have to make these fig roll about  so that he will think the wind move them  and straight  way he hump himself up and move  and sent the littl fig fli  and his back show through  the littl jackal did not wait for a second look  he ran out of the garden like the wind  but as he ran he call back   thank you  again  mr allig  veri sweet of you to show me where you are  i can  t stay to thank you as i should like  good  bye  at

fir tree when i was a veri littl girl some one  probabl my mother  read to me han christian andersen  s stori of the littl fir tree  it happen that i did not read it for myself or hear it again dure my childhood  one christma day  when i was grown up  i found myself at a loss for the  one more  stori call for by some littl children with whom i was spend the holiday  in the mental search for buri treasur which ensu  i came upon one or two word  impress of the experi of the littl fir tree  and forthwith wove them into what i suppos to be someth of a reproduct of the origin  the latter part of the stori had wholli fade from my memori  so that i  made up  to suit the tast of my audienc  afterward i told the stori to a good mani children  at one time or anoth  and it gradual took the shape it has here  it was not until sever year later that  in reread andersen for other purpos  i came upon the real stori of the littl fir tree  and read it for myself  then inde i was amus  and somewhat distress  to find how far i had wander from the text  i give this explan that the reader may know i do not presum to offer the littl tale which follow as an  adapt  of andersen  s famous stori  i offer it plain as a stori which children have like  and which grew out of my earli memori of andersen  s the littl fir tree  onc there was a littl fir tree  slim and point  and shini  which stood in the great forest in the midst of some big fir tree  broad  and tall  and shadowi green  the littl fir tree was veri unhappi becaus he was not big like the other  when the bird came fli into the wood and lit on the branch of the big tree and built their nest there  he use to call up to them   come down  come down  rest in my branch  but they alway said   oh  no  no  you are too littl  when the splendid wind came blow and sing through the forest  it bent and rock and swung the top of the big tree  and murmur to them  then the littl fir tree look up  and call   oh  pleas  dear wind  come down and play with me  but he alway said   oh  no  you are too littl  you are too littl  in the winter the white snow fell soft  soft  and cover the great tree all over with wonder cap and coat of white  the littl fir tree  close down in the cover of the other  would call up   oh  pleas  dear snow  give me a cap  too  i want to play  too  but the snow alway said   oh no  no  no  you are too littl  you are too littl  the worst of all was when men came into the wood  with sledg and team of hors  they came to cut the big tree down and carri them away  whenev one had been cut down and carri away the other talk about it  and nod their head  and the littl fir tree listen  and heard them say that when you were carri away so  you might becom the mast of a mighti ship  and go far away over the ocean  and see mani wonder thing  or you might be part of a fine hous in a great citi  and see much of life  the littl fir tree want great to see life  but he was alway too littl  the men pass him by  but by and by  one cold winter  s morn  men came with a sledg and hors  and after they had cut here and there they came to the circl of tree round the littl fir tree  and look all about   there are none littl enough  they said  oh  how the littl fir tree prick up his needl   here is one  said one of the men   it is just littl enough  and he touch the littl fir tree  the littl fir tree was happi as a bird  becaus he knew they were about to cut him down  and when he was be carri away on the sledg he lay wonder  so content  whether he should be the mast of a ship or part of a fine citi hous  but when they came to the town he was taken out and set upright in a tub and place on the edg of a path in a row of other fir tree  all small  but none so littl as he  and then the littl fir tree began to see life  peopl kept come to look at the tree and to take them away  but alway when they saw the littl fir tree they shook their head and said   it is too littl  too littl  until  final  two children came along  hand in hand  look care at all the small tree  when they saw the littl fir tree they cri out   we  ll take this one  it is just littl enough  they took him out of his tub and carri him away  between them  and the happi littl fir tree spent all his time wonder what it could be that he was just littl enough for  he knew it could hard be a mast or a hous  sinc he was go away with children  he kept wonder  while they took him in through some big door  and set him up in anoth tub  on the tabl  in a bare littl room  veri soon they went away  and came back again with a big basket  which they carri between them  then some pretti ladi  with white cap on their head and white apron over their blue dress  came bring littl parcel  the children took thing out of the basket and began to play with the littl fir tree  just as he had often beg the wind and the snow and the bird to do  he felt their soft littl touch on his head and his twig and his branch  when he look down at himself  as far as he could look  he saw that he was all hung with gold and silver chain  there were string of white fluffi stuff droop around him  his twig held littl gold nut and pink  rosi ball and silver star  he had pretti littl pink and white candl in his arm  but last  and most wonder of all  the children hung a beauti white  float doll  angel over his head  the littl fir tree could not breath  for joy and wonder  what was it that he was  now  whi was this glori for him  after a time everi one went away and left him  it grew dusk  and the littl fir tree began to hear strang sound through the close door  sometim he heard a child cri  he was begin to be lone  it grew more and more shadowi  all at onc  the door open and the two children came in  two of the pretti ladi were with them  they came up to the littl fir tree and quick light all the littl pink and white candl  then the two pretti ladi took hold of the tabl with the littl fir tree on it and push it  veri smooth and quick  out of the door  across a hall  and in at anoth door  the littl fir tree had a sudden sight of a long room with mani littl white bed in it  of children prop up on pillow in the bed  and of other children in great wheel chair  and other hobbl about or sit in littl chair  he wonder whi all the littl children look so white and tire  he did not know that he was in a hospit  but befor he could wonder ani more his breath was quit taken away by the shout those littl white children gave   oh  oh  m  m  m  m  they cri   how pretti  how beauti  oh  isn  t it love  he knew they must mean him  for all their shine eye were look straight at him  he stood as straight as a mast  and quiver in everi needl  for joy  present one littl weak child  voic call out   it  s the nicest christma tree i ever saw  and then  at last  the littl fir tree knew what he was  he was a christma tree  and from his shini head to his feet he was glad  through and through  becaus he was just littl enough to be the nicest kind of tree in the world  how mose was save thousand of year ago  mani year befor david live  there was a veri wise and good man of his peopl who was a friend and advis of the king of egypt  and for love of this friend  the king of egypt had let number of the israelit settl in his land  but after the king and his israelitish friend were dead  there was a new king  who hate the israelit  when he saw how strong they were  and how mani there were of them  he began to be afraid that some day they might number more than the egyptian  and might take his land from him  then he and his ruler did a wick thing  they made the israelit slave  and they gave them terribl task to do  without proper rest  or food  or cloth  for they hope that the hardship would kill off the israelit  they thought the old men would die and the young men be so ill and weari that they could not bring up famili  and so the race would dwindl away  but in spite of the work and suffer  the israelit remain strong  and more and more boy grew up  to make the king afraid  then he did the most wick thing of all  he order his soldier to kill everi boy babi that should be born in an israelitish famili  he did not care about the girl  becaus they could not grow up to fight  veri soon after this wick order  a boy babi was born in a certain israelitish famili  when his mother first look at him her heart was near broken  for he was even more beauti than most babi are  so strong and fair and sweet  but he was a boy  how could she save him from death  somehow  she contriv to keep him hidden for three whole month  but at the end of that time  she saw that it would not be possibl to keep him safe ani longer  she had been think all this time about what she should do  and now she carri out her plan  first  she took a basket made of bulrush and daub it all over with pitch  so that it was water  tight  and then she laid the babi in it  then she carri it to the edg of the river and laid it in the flag by the river  s brink  it did not show at all  unless one were quit near it  then she kiss her littl son and left him there  but his sister stood far off  not seem to watch  but realli watch care to see what would happen to the babi  soon there was the sound of talk and laughter  and a train of beauti women came down to the water  s edg  it was the king  s daughter  come down to bath in the river  with her maiden  the maiden walk along by the river side  as the king  s daughter came near to the water  she saw the strang littl basket lie in the flag  and she sent her maid to bring it to her  and when she had open it  she saw the child  the poor babi was cri  when she saw him  so helpless and so beauti  cri for his mother  the king  s daughter piti him and love him  she knew the cruel order of her father  and she said at onc   this is one of the hebrew  children  at that moment the babi  s sister came to the princess and said   shall i go and find thee a nurs from the hebrew women  so that she may nurs the child for thee  not a word did she say about whose child it was  but perhap the princess guess  i don  t know  at all event  she told the littl girl to go  so the maiden went  and brought her mother  then the king  s daughter said to the babi  s mother   take this child away and nurs it for me  and i will give thee wage  was not that a strang thing  and can you think how happi the babi  s mother was  for now the babi would be known onli as the princess  s adopt child  and would be safe  and it was so  the mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken to the princess  s palac  then he was brought and given to the king  s daughter  and he becam her son  and she name him mose  but the strangest part of the whole stori is  that when mose grew to be a man he becam so strong and wise that it was he who at last save his peopl from the king and rescu them from the egyptian  the one child save by the king  s own daughter was the veri one the king would most have want to kill  if he

sent down littl stream of pure water  the wind were gentl  and lie like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hill was a marvel lake of salt water  an inland sea  so the pioneer settl there and built themselv hut and cabin for the first winter  it had taken them mani month to make the terribl journey  mani had die of weari and ill on the way  mani die of hardship dure the winter  and the provis they had brought in their wagon were so near gone that  by spring  they were live part on root  dug from the ground  all their live now depend on the crop of grain and veget which they could

in the field  kill what they could  but while they fought in one place new armi of cricket march down the mountain  side and attack the field in other place  and at last the peopl fell on their knee and wept and cri in despair  for they saw starvat and death in the field  a few knelt to pray  other gather round and join them  weep  more left their useless struggl and knelt besid their neighbour  at last near all the peopl were kneel on the desol field pray for deliver from the plagu of cricket  sudden  from far off in the air toward the great salt lake  there was the sound of flap wing  it

was to have a golden perch near the emperor  s bed  and a littl golden cage  and was to be allow to go out twice everi day  but there were twelv servant appoint to wait on her  and those twelv servant went with her everi time she went out  and each of the twelv had hold of the end of a silken string which was tie to the littl nightingal  s leg  it was not so veri much fun to go out that way  for a long  long time the nightingal sang everi even to the emperor and his court  and they like her so much that the ladi all tri to sing like her  they use to put water in their mouth and then make littl sound like this  glu  glu  glug  and when the courtier met each other in the hall  one would say  night  and the other would say  ingal  and that was suppos to be convers  at last  one day  there came a littl packag to the emperor  on the outsid of which was written   the nightingal  insid was an artifici bird  someth like a nightingal  onli it was made of gold  and silver  and rubi  and emerald  and diamond  when it was wound up it play a waltz tune  and as it play it move it littl tail up and down  everybodi in the court was fill with delight at the music of the new nightingal  they made it sing that same tune thirti  three time  and still they had not had enough  they would have made it sing the tune thirti  four time  but the emperor said   i should like to hear the real nightingal sing  now  but when they look about for the real littl nightingal  they could not find her anywher  she had taken the chanc  while everybodi was listen to the waltz tune  to fli away through the window to her own greenwood   what a veri ungrat bird  said the lord and ladi   but it doe not matter  the new nightingal is just as good  so the artifici nightingal was given the real nightingal  s littl gold perch  and everi night the emperor wound her up  and she sang waltz tune to him  the peopl in the court like her even better than the old nightingal  becaus they could all whistl her tune  which you can  t do with real nightingal  about a year after the artifici nightingal came  the emperor was listen to her waltz tune  when there was a snap and whir  r  r insid the bird  and the music stop  the emperor ran to his doctor  but he could not do anyth  then he ran to his clock  maker  but he could not do much  nobodi could do much  the best they could do was to patch the gold nightingal up so that it could sing onc a year  even that was almost too much  and the tune was veri shaki  still  the emperor kept the gold nightingal on the perch in his own room  a long time went by  and then  at last  the emperor grew veri ill  and was about to die  when it was sure that he could not live much longer  the peopl chose a new emperor and wait for the old one to die  the poor emperor lay  quit cold and pale  in his great big bed  with velvet curtain and tall candlestick all about  he was quit alon  for all the courtier had gone to congratul the new emperor  and all the servant had gone to talk it over  when the emperor woke up  he felt a terribl weight on his chest  he open his eye  and there was death  sit on his heart  death had put on the emperor  s gold crown  and he had the gold sceptr in one hand  and the silken banner in the other  and he look at the emperor with his great hollow eye  the room was full of shadow  and the shadow were full of face  everywher the emperor look  there were face  some were veri  veri ugli  and some were sweet and love  they were all the thing the emperor had done in his life  good and bad  and as he look at them they began to whisper  they whisper   do you rememb this     do you rememb that    the emperor rememb so much that he cri out loud   oh  bring the great drum  make music  so that i may not hear these dread whisper  but there was nobodi there to bring the drum  then the emperor cri   you littl gold nightingal  can you not sing someth for me  i have given you gift of gold and jewel  and kept you alway by my side  will you not help me now  but there was nobodi to wind the littl gold nightingal up  and of cours it could not sing  the emperor  s heart grew colder and colder where death crouch upon it  and the dread whisper grew louder and louder  and the emperor  s life was almost gone  sudden  through the open window  there came a most love song  it was so sweet and so loud that the whisper die quit away  present the emperor felt his heart grow warm  then he felt the blood flow through his limb again  he listen to the song until the tear ran down his cheek  he knew that it was the littl real nightingal who had flown away from him when the gold nightingal came  death was listen to the song  too  and when it was done and the emperor beg for more  death  too  said   pleas sing again  littl nightingal   will you give me the emperor  s gold crown for a song  said the littl nightingal   yes  said death  and the littl nightingal bought the emperor  s crown for a song   oh  sing again  littl nightingal  beg death   will you give me the emperor  s sceptr for anoth song  said the littl grey nightingal   yes  said death  and the littl nightingal bought the emperor  s sceptr for anoth song  onc more death beg for a song  and this time the littl nightingal obtain the banner for her sing  then she sang one more song  so sweet and so sad that it made death think of his garden in the churchyard  where he alway like best to be  and he rose from the emperor  s heart and float away through the window  when death was gone  the emperor said to the littl nightingal   oh  dear littl nightingal  you have save me from death  do not leav me again  stay with me on this littl gold perch  and sing to me alway   no  dear emperor  said the littl nightingal   i sing best when i am free  i cannot live in a palac  but everi night when you are quit alon  i will come and sit in the window and sing to you  and tell you everyth that goe on in your kingdom  i will tell you where the poor peopl are who ought to be help  and where the wick peopl are who ought to be punish  onli  dear emperor  be sure that you never let anybodi know that you have a littl bird who tell you everyth  after the littl nightingal had flown away  the emperor felt so well and strong that he dress himself in his royal robe and took his gold sceptr in his hand  and when the courtier came in to see if he were dead  there stood the emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptr in the other  and said   good  morn  margeri  s garden there was onc a littl girl name margeri  who had alway live in the citi  the flat where her mother and father live was at the top of a big build  and you couldn  t see a great deal from the window  except chimney  pot on other peopl  s roof  margeri did not know much about tree and flower  but she love them dear  whenev it was a fine sunday she use to go with her mother and father to the park and look at the love flower  bed  they seem alway to be finish  though  and margeri was alway wish she could see them grow  one spring  when margeri was nine  her father obtain a new situat and they remov to a littl hous with a nice big piec of ground a short distanc outsid the town where his new posit was  margeri was delight  and the veri first thing she said  when her father told her about it  was   oh  may i have a garden  may i have a garden  margeri  s mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was  and margeri  s father said he expect to live on their veget all the rest of his life  so it was soon agre that the garden should be the first thing attend to  behind the cottag were appl tree  a plum tree  and two or three pear tree  then came a stretch of rough grass  and then a stone wall  with a gate lead into the field  it was on the grass plot that the garden was to be  a big piec was to be use for wheat and pea and bean  and a littl piec at the end was to be given to margeri   what shall we have in it  ask her mother   flower  said margeri  with shine eye  blue  and white  and yellow  and pink  everi kind of flower   sure  flower  said her mother   and shall we not have a littl salad garden in the middl   what is a salad garden  margeri ask   it is a garden where you have all the thing that make nice salad  said her mother  laugh  for margeri was fond of salad   you have lettuc  and endiv  and mustard and cress  and parsley  and radish  and beetroot  and young onion   oh  how good it sound  said margeri   i should love a salad garden  that veri even  margeri  s father took pencil and paper  and drew out a plan for her garden  first  they talk it all over  then he drew what they decid on  it look like the diagram on the next page   the outsid strip is for flower  said margeri  s father   and next is a footpath  all the way round the bed  that is to let you get at the flower to weed and to pick  there is a wider path through the middl  and the rest is for row of salad veget   papa  it is glorious  said margeri  papa laugh   i hope you will still think it glorious when the weed time come  he said   for you know  you and mother have promis to take care of this garden  while i take care of the big one   i wouldn  t not take care of it for anyth  said margeri   i want to feel that it is my veri own   illustr  her father kiss her  and said it was certain her  veri own  two even after that  when margeri was call in from her first rambl in the field  she found the postman at the door   someth for you  margeri  said her mother  with the look she had when someth nice was happen  it was a box  quit a big box  with a label on it that said  miss margeri brown  primros cottag  21 narcissus road  colchest  from seed and plant compani  read  margeri could hard wait to open it  it was fill with littl packag  all with print label  and in the packag  of cours  were seed  it made margeri danc  just to read the name  nasturtium  giant helianthus  canariensi  calendula  canterburi bell  more name than i can tell you  and other packag  bigger  that said   sweet pea   french bean   carrot   wallflow  and such thing  margeri could almost smell the posi  she was so excit  onli  she had seen so littl of flower that she did not know what all the name meant  she did not know that a helianthus was a sunflow until her mother told her so  and she had never seen the dear  blue  bell  shape flower that alway grow in old  fashion garden  and are call canterburi bell  she thought the calendula must be a strang  grand flower  by it name  but her mother told her it was the gay  sturdi  everydayish littl flower call a marigold  there was a great deal for a littl citi girl to be surpris about  and it did seem as if morn was a long way off   did you think you could plant them in the morn  ask her mother   you know  dear  the ground has to be made readi first  it take a littl time  it may be sever day befor you can plant  that was anoth surpris  margeri had thought she could begin to sow the seed right off  but this was what had happen  earli the next morn  a man came drive up to the cottag with two strong white hors  in his wagon was a plough  i suppos you have seen plough  but margeri never had  and she watch with great interest  while the man and her father took the plough from the cart and har the hors to it  it was a great  three  corner piec of sharp steel  with long handl come up from it  so that a man could hold it in place  it look like this   illustr   i brought a two  hors plough becaus it  s virgin soil  the man said  margeri wonder what in the world he meant  it had not been cultiv  of cours  but what had that do with the kind of plough   what doe he mean  father  she whisper  when she got a chanc   he mean that this land has not been plough befor  it will be hard to turn the soil  and one hors could not pull the plough  said her father  it took the man two hour to plough the littl strip of land  he drove the sharp end of the plough into the soil  and held it firm so  while the hors drew it along in a straight line  margeri found it fascin to watch the long line of dark earth and green grass come roll up and turn over  as the knife pass it  she could see that it took real skill and strength to keep the line even  and to avoid the stone  sometim the plough struck a hidden stone  and then the man was jerk almost off his feet  but he onli laugh  and said   tough piec of land  it will be a lot better next year  when he had plough  the man went back to his cart and unload anoth farm implement  this one was like a three  corner platform of wood  with a long  curv  strong rake under it  it was call a harrow  and it look like the diagram on the next page  the man har the hors to it  and then he stood on the platform and drove all over the strip of land  it was fun to watch  but perhap it was a littl hard to do  the man  s weight kept the harrow steadi  and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up  so that it did not stay in ridg   he scrambl the ground  father  said margeri   it need  scrambl  laugh her father   we are go to get more weed than we want on this fresh soil  and the more the ground is broken  the fewer there will be   illustr  after the plough and harrow  the man drove off  and margeri  s father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late afternoon  when he came home from busi  they could not afford too much help  he said  and he had learn to take care of a garden when he was a boy  so margeri did not see ani more done until the next day  but the next day there was hard work for margeri  s father  everi bit of that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade  and then the clod which were full of grass  root had to be taken on a fork and shaken  till the earth fell out  when the grass was thrown to one side  that would not have had to be done if the land had been plough in the autumn  the grass would have rot in the ground  and would have made food for the plant  now  margeri  s father put the fertilis on the top  and then rake it into the earth  at last  it was time to make the place for the seed  margeri and her mother help  father tie one end of a cord to a littl stake  and drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden  then he took the cord to the other end of the garden and pull it tight  tie it to anoth stake  and drove that down  that made a straight line  then he ho a trench  a few inch deep  the whole length of the cord  and scatter fertilis in it  pretti soon the whole garden was line with littl trench   now for the seed  said father  margeri ran and brought the seed box   may i help  she ask   if you watch me sow one row  i think you can do the next  said her father  so margeri watch  her father took a hand of pea  and  stoop  walk slowli along the line  let the seed trickl through his finger  it was pretti to watch  it made margeri think of a photograph her teacher had  a photograph of a famous pictur call  the sower  perhap you have seen it  put in the seed was not so easi to do as to watch  sometim margeri drop in too much  and sometim not enough  but her father was patient with her  and soon she did better  they plant pea  bean  spinach  carrot  and parsnip  and margeri  s father made a row of hole  after that  for the tomato plant  he said those had to be transplant  they could not be sown from seed  when the seed were in the trench they had to be cover up  and margeri realli help at that  it is fun to do it  you stand besid the littl trench and walk backward  and as you walk you hoe the loos earth back over the seed  the same earth that was ho up you pull back again  then you rake veri gentl over the surfac  with the back of a rake  to even it all off  margeri like it  becaus now the garden began to look like a garden  but best of all was the work next day  when her own littl particular garden was begun  father brown love margeri and margeri  s mother so much that he want their garden to be perfect  and that meant a great deal more work  he knew veri well that the old grass would begin to come through again on such soil  and that it would make terribl hard weed  he was not go to have ani such thing for his two  littl girl  as he call them  so he gave that littl garden particular attent  this is what he did  after he had thrown out all the turf  he shovel clean earth on to the garden  as much as three solid inch of it  not a bit of grass was in that  then it was readi for rake and fertilis  and for the line  the littl footpath were mark out by father brown  s feet  margeri and her mother laugh well at his action  for it look like some kind of danc  mr brown had seen garden do it when he was a littl boy  and he did it veri nice  he walk along the side of the squar  with one foot turn a littl out  and the other straight  take such tini step that his feet touch each other all the time  this tramp out a path just wide enough for a person to walk  the wider path was mark with line and rake  margeri thought  of cours  all the flower would be put in as the veget were  but she found that it was not so  for some  her father poke littl hole with his finger  for some  he made veri shallow trench  and some veri small seed were scatter light over the top of the ground  margeri and her mother had taken so much pain in think out the arrang of the flower  that perhap you will like to hear just how they design that garden  at the back were the sweet pea  which would grow tall  like a screen  on the two side  for a kind of hedg  were yellow sunflow  and along the front edg were the gay nasturtium  margeri plan that  so that she could look into the garden from the front  but have it shut away from the veget patch by the tall flower on the side  the two front corner had canariensi in them  canariensi is a pretti creeper with golden blossom  veri dainti and bright  and then  in littl squar patch all round the garden  were plant london pride  blue bachelor  s button  yellow marigold  tall larkspur  mani  colour aster  hollyhock and stock  all these love flower use to grow in our grandmoth  garden  and if you don  t know what they look like  i hope you can find out next summer  between the flower and the middl path went the seed for that wonder salad garden  all the thing mrs brown had name to margeri were there  margeri had never seen anyth more wonder than the littl round lettuc  seed  they were so tini that it did not seem possibl that green lettuc leav could come from them  but they sure would  mother and father and margeri were late to supper that even  but they were all so happi that it did not matter  the last thing margeri thought of  as she went to sleep at night  was the dear  smooth littl garden  with it funni footpath  and with the littl stick stand at the end of the row  label  lettuc   beet   helianthus  and so on   i have a garden  i have a garden  was margeri  s last thought as she went off to dreamland  the littl cotyledon this is anoth stori about margeri  s garden  the next morn after the garden was plant  margeri was up and out at six o  clock  she could not wait to look at her garden  to be sure  she knew that the seed could not sprout in a singl night  but she had a feel that something might happen at ani moment  the garden was just as smooth and brown as the night befor  and no littl seedl were in sight  but a veri few morn after that  when margeri went out  she saw a funni littl crack open up through the earth  the whole length of the patch  quick she knelt down on the footpath  to see  yes  tini green leav  a whole row of them  were push their way through the crust  margeri knew what she had put there  it was the radish  row  these must be radish leav  she examin them veri close  so that she might know a radish next time  the littl leav  no bigger than half your littl  finger nail  grew in twos  two on each tini stem  they were almost round  margeri flew back to her mother  to say that the first seed were up  and her mother  near as excit as margeri  came to look at the littl crack  each day  after that  the row of radish grew  till  in a week  it stood as high as your finger  green and sturdi  but about the third day  while margeri was stoop over the radish  she saw someth veri  veri small and green  peep abov ground  where the lettuc was plant  could it be weed  no  for on look veri close she saw that the wee leav faint mark a regular row  they did not make a crack  like the radish  they seem too small and too far apart to push the earth up like that  margeri lean down and look with all her eye at the babi plant  the tini leav grew two on a stem  and were almost round  the more she look at them the more it seem to margeri that they look exact as the radish look when it first came up   do you suppos  margeri said to herself   that lettuc and radish look alik while they are grow  they don  t look alik when they are on the tabl  day by day the lettuc grew  and soon the littl round leav were easier to examin  they certain were veri much like radish leav  then  one morn  while she was search for sign of other seed  margeri discov the beet  in irregular patch on the row  hint of green were come  the next day and the next they grew  until the beet leav were big enough to see  margeri look  then she look again  then she wrinkl her forehead   can we have made a mistak  she thought   do you suppos we can have plant all radish  for those littl beet leav were almost round  and they grew two on a stem  precis like the lettuc and the radish  except for the size  all three row look alik  it was too much for margeri  she ran to the hous and found her father  her littl face was so anxious that he thought someth unpleas had happen   papa  she said  all out of breath   do you think we could have made a mistak about my garden  do you think we could have put radish in all the row  father laugh   what make you think such a thing  he ask   papa  said margeri   the littl leav all look exact alik  everi plant has just two tini leav on it  and shape the same  they are roundish  and grow out of the stem at the same place  papa  s eye began to twinkl   mani of the dicotyledon plant look alik at the begin  he said  with a littl drawl on the big word  that was to teas margeri  becaus she alway want to know the big word she heard   what  s  dicotyledon  said margeri  care   wait till i come home to  night  dear  said her father   and i  ll tell you  that even margeri was wait eager for him  when her father finish his supper they went togeth to the garden  and father examin the seedl care  then he pull up a littl radish plant and a tini beet   these littl leav  he said   are not the real leav of the plant  they are onli littl pocket to hold food for the plant to live on till it get strong enough to push up into the air  as soon as the real leav come out and begin to draw food from the air  these littl substitut wither up and fall off  these two lie fold up in the littl seed from the begin  and are full of plant food  they don  t have to be veri special in shape  you see  becaus they don  t stay on the plant after it is grown up   then everi plant look like this at first  said margeri   no  dear  not everi one  plant are divid into two kind  those which have two food leav  like these plant  and those which have onli one  these are call dicotyledon  and the one which have but one food leaf are monocotyledon  mani of the dicotyledon look alik   i think that is interest  said margeri   i alway  suppos the plant were differ from the minut they began to grow   inde  no  said father   even some of the tree look like this when they first come through  you would not think a birch tree could look like a veget or a flower  would you  but it doe  at first  it look so much like these thing that in the great nurseri  where tree are rais for forest and park  the workmen have to be veri care train  or els they would pull up the tree when they are weed  they have to be taught the differ between a birch tree and a weed   how funni  said margeri  dimpl   yes  it sound funni  said father   but  you see  the birch tree is dicotyledon  and so are mani weed  and the dicotyledon look so much alik at first   i am glad to know that  father  said margeri  sober   i believ i shall learn a good deal from live in the countri  don  t you think so  margeri  s father took her in his arm   i hope so  dear  he said   the countri is a good place for littl girl  and that was all that happen  that day  the talkat tortois onc upon a time  a tortois live in a pond with two duck  who were her veri good friend  she enjoy the compani of the duck  becaus she could talk with them to her heart  s content  the tortois like to talk  she alway had someth to say  and she like to hear herself say it  after mani year of this pleasant live  the pond becam veri low  in a dri season  and final it dri up  the two duck saw that they could no longer live there  so they decid to fli to anoth region  where there was more water  they went to the tortois to bid her good  bye   oh  don  t leav me behind  beg the tortois   take me with you  i must die if i am left here   but you cannot fli  said the duck   how can we take you with us   take me with you  take me with you  said the tortois  the duck felt so sorri for her that at last they thought of a way to take her   we have thought of a way which will be possibl  they said   if onli you can manag to keep still long enough  we will each take hold of one end of a stout stick  and do you take the middl in your mouth  then we will fli up in the air with you and carri you with us  but rememb not to talk  if you open your mouth  you are lost  the tortois said she would not say a word  she would not so much as move her mouth  and she was veri grate  so the duck brought a strong littl stick and took hold of the end  while the tortois bit firm on the middl  then the two duck rose slowli in the air and flew away with their burden  when they were abov the treetop  the tortois want to say   how high we are  but she rememb  and kept still  when they pass the church steepl she want to say   what is that which shine  but she rememb  and held her peac  then they came over the villag squar  and the peopl look up and saw them   look at the duck carri a tortois  they shout  and everi one ran to look  the tortois want to say   what busi is it of your  but she didn  t  then she heard the peopl shout   isn  t it strang  look at it  look  the tortois forgot everyth except that she want to say   hush  you foolish peopl  she open her mouth  and fell to the ground  and that was the end of the tortois  it is a veri good thing to be abl to hold one  s tongu  robert of sicili an old legend say that there was onc a king

thousand year it had peopl who dug in the mine  and knew how to weav cloth and to make beauti ornament out of gold  and who could fight and make law  but we do not know just where they came from  nor exact how they live  these peopl left us some splendid stori about their king  their fight  and their beauti women  but it all happen such a long time ago that the stori are mixtur of thing that realli happen and what peopl said about them  and we don  t know just which is which  the stori are call legends  one of the prettiest legend is the stori i am go to tell you about the dagda  s harp  it is said that there were two quit differ kind of peopl in ireland  one set of peopl with long dark hair and dark eye  call fomorian  they carri long slender spear made of golden bronz when they fought  and anoth race of peopl who were golden  hair and blue  eye  and who carri short  blunt  heavi spear of dull metal  the golden  hair peopl had a great chieftain who was also a kind of high priest  who was call the dagda  and this dagda had a wonder magic harp  the harp was beauti to look upon  mighti in size  made of rare wood  and ornament with gold and jewel  and it had wonder music in it string  which onli the dagda could call out  when the men were go out to battl  the dagda would set up his magic harp and sweep his hand across the string  and a war song would ring out which would make everi warrior buckl on his armour  brace his knee  and shout   forth to the fight  then  when the men came back from the battl  weari and wound  the dagda would take his harp and strike a few chord  and as the magic music stole out upon the air  everi man forgot his weari and the smart of his wound  and thought of the honour he had won  and of the comrad who had die besid him  and of the safeti of his wife and children  then the song would swell out louder  and everi warrior would rememb onli the glori he had help win for the king  and each man would rise at the great tabl  his cup in his hand  and shout  long live the king  there came a time when the fomorian and the golden  hair men were at war  and in the midst of a great battl  while the dagda  s hall was not so well guard as usual  some of the chieftain of the fomorian stole the great harp from the wall  where it hung  and fled away with it  their wive and children and some few of their soldier went with them  and they fled fast and far through the night  until they were a long way from the battlefield  then they thought they were safe  and they turn asid into a vacant castl  by the road  and sat down to a banquet  hang the stolen harp on the wall  the dagda  with two or three of his warrior  had follow hard on their track  and while they were in the midst of their banquet  the door was sudden burst

dragon ship when they cross the north sea to settl in england  in those day men were apt to invent stori to account for thing about them which seem peculiar  and love the sea as they did  it is not strang that they had remark the peculiar of the ocean water and had found a reason whi it is so differ from the water in the river and steam  this is not the onli stori that has come down to tell us how peopl of old account for the sea be salt  there are mani such stori  each differ from the other  all show that the same childlik spirit of inquiri was at work in differ place  strive to find an answer to this riddl of natur       there sprang from the son of odin a race of men who becam mighti king of the earth  and one of these  name frode  rule over the land that are call denmark  now about this time were found in denmark two great millston  so larg that no one had the strength to turn them  so frode sent for all the wise men of the land and bade them examin the stone and tell him of what use they were  sinc no one could grind with them  and after the wise men had look close at them and read the magic letter which were cut upon their edg  they said that the millston were precious inde  sinc they would grind out of noth anyth that the miller might wish  so king frode sent messeng over the world to find for him two servant who would be strong enough to grind with the millston  and after a long  long time his messeng found him two maid  servant  who were bigger and stronger than anyon in denmark had ever seen  but no one guess that these were realli giant  maiden who bore a grudg against all of the race of odin  direct the giant  maiden were brought befor frode  and befor they had rest after their long journey  or satisfi their hunger  he bade them go to the mill  and grind for him gold and peac and happi   they sang and swung the swift mill stone  and with loud voic they made their moan   we grind for frode wealth and gold abund rich he shall behold  present frode came into the mill to see that the new servant were perform their task dilig  and as he watch them from the shadow by the door  the maiden stay their grind for a while to rest  the greedi man could not bear to see even an instant  s paus  and he came out of the shadow  and bade them  with harsh word  go on grind  and ceas not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent  or while he himself sang a song  now it was earli summer  time  and the cuckoo was call all the day and most of the night  so the giant  maiden wax veri wroth with king frode  and as they resum their labour they sang a song of the hard of their lot in the household of this pitiless king  they had been grind out wealth and happi and peac  but now they bade the magic stone to grind someth veri differ  present  as the great stone move round and round  frode  who still stood by  heard one chant in a low  sing  song voic   i see a fire east of the town  the curlew awak and sound a note of warn  a host approach in hast  to burn the dwell of the king  and the next took up her song   no longer will frode sit on his throne  and rule over ring of red gold and mighti millston  now must we grind with all our might  and  behold  red warrior come forth  and reveng  and bloodsh  and ruin  then frode shook from head to foot in his terror  for he heard the tramp of a mighti host of warrior advanc from the sea  and as he look for a way of escap  the brace of the millston broke with the strong grind  and fell in two  and the whole world shook and trembl with the mighti shock of that break  but through the crash and din came the voic of the giant  maiden  loud chant   we have turn the stone round  though weari the maiden  see what they have ground  and that same night a mighti sea  king came up and slew frode and plunder his citi  when he had sack the citi  the sea  king took on board his ship the two giant  maiden  and with them the broken millston  and he bade them begin at onc to grind salt  for of this he had veri scanti store  so they ground and ground  and in the middl of the night  be weari  they ask the sea  king if he had not got salt enough  but the sea  king was hard of heart  like frode  and he rough bade them go on grind  and the maiden did so  and work to such effect that within a short time the millston had ground out so much salt that the weight of it began to sink the ship  down  down it sank  ship and giant and millston  and in that spot  in the veri middl of the ocean  aros a whirlpool  from whenc the salt is carri north and south  east and west  throughout the water of the earth  and that is how the sea becam salt  the castl of fortun one love summer morn  just as the sun rose  two travel start on a journey  they were both strong young men  but one was a lazi fellow and the other was a worker  as the first sunbeam came over the hill  they shone on a great castl stand on the height  as far away as the eye could see  it was a wonder and beauti castl  all glisten tower that gleam like marbl  and glanc window that shone like crystal  the two young men look at it eager  and long to go nearer  sudden  out of the distanc  someth like a great butterfli  of white and gold  swept toward them  and when it came nearer  they saw that it was a most beauti ladi  robe in float garment as fine as cobweb and wear on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell whether it was of diamond or of dew  she stood  light as air  on a great  shine  golden ball  which roll along with her  swifter than the wind  as she pass the travel  she turn her face to them and smile   follow me  she said  the lazi man sat down in the grass with a discont sigh   she has an easi time of it  he said  but the industri man ran after the love ladi and caught the hem of her float robe in his grasp   who are you  and whither are you go  he ask   i am the fairi of fortun  the beauti ladi said   and that is my castl  you may reach it to  day  if you will  there is time  if you wast none  if you reach it befor the last stroke of midnight  i will receiv you there  and will be your friend  but if you come one second after midnight  it will be too late  when she had said this  her robe slip from the travel  s hand and she was gone  the industri man hurri back to his friend  and told him what the fairi had said   the idea  said the lazi  man  and he laugh   of cours  if we had a hors there would be some chanc  but walk all that way  no  thank you   then good  bye  said his friend   i am off  and he set out  down the road toward the shine castl  with a good steadi stride  his eye straight ahead  the lazi man lay down in the soft grass  and look rather wist at the far  away tower   if onli i had a good hors  he sigh  just at that moment he felt someth warm nose about at his shoulder  and heard a littl whinni  he turn round  and there stood a littl hors  it was a dainti creatur  gentl  look  and fine built  and it was saddl and bridl   hello  said the lazi man   luck often come when one isn  t look for it  and in an instant he had leap on the hors  and head him for the castl of fortun  the littl hors start at a fine pace  and in a veri few minut they overtook the other travel  plod along on foot   how do you like shank  s poni  laugh the lazi man  as he pass his friend  the industri man onli nod  and kept on with his steadi stride  eye straight ahead  the hors kept his good pace  and by noon the tower of the castl stood out against the sky  much nearer and more beauti  exact at noon  the hors turn asid from the road  into a shadi grove on a hill  and stop   wise beast  said his rider   hast make wast  and all thing are better in moder  i  ll follow your exampl  and eat and rest a bit  he dismount and sat down in the cool moss  with his back against a tree  he had a lunch in his travel  s pouch  and he ate it comfort  then he felt drowsi from the heat and the earli ride  so he pull his hat over his eye  and settl himself for a nap   it will go all the better for a littl rest  he said  that was a sleep  he slept like the seven sleeper  and he dream the most beauti thing you could imagin  at last  he dream that he had enter the castl of fortun and was be receiv with great festiv  everyth he want was brought to him  and music play while firework were set off in his honour  the music was so loud that he awok  he sat up  rub his eye  and behold  the firework were the veri last ray of the set sun  and the music was the voic of the other travel  pass the grove on foot   time to be off  said the lazi man  and look about him for the pretti hors  no hors was to be found  the onli live thing near was an old  boni  grey donkey  the man call  and whistl  and look  but no littl hors appear  after a long while he gave it up  and  sinc there was noth better to do  he mount the old grey donkey and set out again  the donkey was slow  and he was hard to ride  but he was better than noth  and gradual the lazi man saw the tower of the castl draw nearer  now it began to grow dark  in the castl window the light began to show  then came troubl  slower  and slower  went the grey donkey  slower  and slower  till  in the veri middl of a pitch  black wood  he stop and stood still  not a step would he budg for all the coax and scold and beat his rider could give  at last the rider kick him  as well as beat him  and at that the donkey felt that he had had enough  up went his hind heel  and down went his head  and over it went the lazi man on to the stoni ground  there he lay groan for mani minut  for it was not a soft place  i can assur you  how he wish he were in a soft  warm bed  with his ach bone comfort in blanket  the veri thought of it made him rememb the castl of fortun  for he knew there must be fine bed there  to get to those bed he was even will to bestir his poor limb  so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey  no donkey was to be found  the lazi man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen  scratch his hand on the stump  tore his face in the brier  and bump his knee on the stone  but no donkey was there  he would have laid down to sleep again  but he could hear now the howl of hungri wolv in the wood  that it did not sound pleasant  final  his hand struck against someth that felt like a saddl  he grasp it  thank  and start to mount his donkey  the beast he took hold of seem veri small  and  as he mount  he felt that it side were moist and slimi  it gave him a shudder  and he hesit  but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike  it was strike eleven  there was still time to reach the castl of fortun  but no more than enough  so he mount his new steed and rode on onc more  the anim was easier to sit on than the donkey  and the saddl seem remark high behind  it was good to lean against  but even the donkey was not so slow as this  the new steed was slower than he  after a while  howev  he push his way out of the wood into the open  and there stood the castl  onli a littl way ahead  all it window were ablaz with light  a ray from them fell on the lazi man  s beast  and he saw what he was ride  it was a gigant snail  a snail as larg as a calf  a cold shudder ran over the lazi man  s bodi  and he would have got off his horrid anim then and there  but just then the clock struck onc more  it was the first of the long  slow stroke that mark midnight  the man grew frantic when he heard it  he drove his heel into the snail  s side  to make him hurri  instant  the snail drew in his head  curl up in his shell  and left the lazi man sit in a heap on the ground  the clock struck twice  if the man had run for it  he could still have reach the castl  but  instead  he sat still and shout for a hors   a beast  a beast  he wail   ani kind of a beast that will take me to the castl  the clock struck three time  and as it struck the third note  someth came rustl and rattl out of the dark  someth that sound like a hors with har  the lazi man jump on it back  a veri queer  low back  as he mount  he saw the door of the castl open  and saw his friend stand on the threshold  wave his cap and beckon to him  the clock struck four time  and the new steed began to stir  as it struck five  he move a pace forward  as it struck six  he stop  as it struck seven  he turn himself about  as it struck eight  he began to move backward  away from the castl  the lazi man shout  and beat him  but the beast went slowli backward  and the clock struck nine  the man tri to slide off  then  but from all side of his strang anim great arm came reach up and held him fast  and in the next ray of moonlight that broke the dark cloud  he saw that he was mount on a monster crab  one by one  the light went out  in the castl window  the clock struck ten  backward went the crab  eleven  still the crab went backward  the clock struck twelv  then the great door shut with a clang  and the castl of fortun was close for ever to the lazi man  what becam of him and his crab no one know to this day  and no one care  but the industri man was receiv by the fairi of fortun  and made happi in the castl as long as he want to stay  and ever afterward she was his friend  help him not onli to happi for himself  but also show him how to help other  wherev he went  david and goliath a long time ago  there was a boy name david  who live in a countri in the far east  he was good to look upon  for he had fair hair and a ruddi skin  and he was veri strong and brave and modest  he was shepherd  boy for his father  and all day  often all night  he was out in the field  far from home  watch over the sheep  he had to guard them from wild anim  and lead them to the right pastur  and care for them  by and by  war broke out between the peopl of david  s countri and a peopl that live near at hand  these men were call philistin  and the peopl of david  s countri were name israelit  all the strong men of israel went up to the battl  to fight for their king  david  s three older brother went  but he was onli a boy  so he was left behind to care for the sheep  after the brother had been gone some time  david  s father long veri much to hear from them  and to know if they were safe  so he sent for david  from the field  and said to him   take now for thi brother an ephah of this parch corn  and these ten loav  and run to the camp  where thi brother are  and carri these ten chees to the captain of their thousand  and see how thi brother fare  and bring me word again   an ephah is about three peck  david rose earli in the morn  and left the sheep with a keeper  and took the corn and the loav and the chees  as his father had command him  and went to the camp of the israelit  the camp stood on a mountain on the one side  and the philistin stood on a mountain on the other side  and there was a valley between  david came to the place where the israelit were  just as the host was go forth to the fight  shout for the battl  so he left his gift in the hand of the keeper of the baggag  and ran into the armi  amongst the soldier  to find his brother  when he found them  he salut them and began to talk with them  but while he was ask them the question his father had command  there aros a great shout and tumult among the israelit  and men came run back from the front line of battl  everyth becam confus  david look to see what the troubl was  and he saw a strang sight  down the slope of the opposit mountain came stride a philistin warrior  call out someth in a taunt voic  he was a gigant man  the largest david had ever seen  and he was cover with armour  that shone in the sun  he had a helmet of brass upon his head  and he was arm with a coat of mail  and he had greav of brass upon his leg  and a target of brass between his shoulder  his spear was so tremend that the staff of it was like a weaver  s beam  and his shield so great that a man went befor him  to carri it   who is that  ask david   it is goliath  of gath  champion of the philistin  said the soldier about   everi day  for forti day  he has come forth  so  and challeng us to send a man against him  in singl combat  and sinc no one dare to go out against him alon  the armi cannot fight   that was one of the law of warfar in those time   what  said david   doe none dare go out against him  as he spoke  the giant stood still  on the hillsid opposit the host of israel  and shout his challeng  scorn  he said   whi are ye come out to set your battl in array  am i not a philistin  and ye servant of saul  choos you a man  and let him come down to me  if he be abl to fight with me  and to kill me  then will we be your servant  but if i prevail against him  and kill him  then shall ye be our servant  and serv us  i defi the armi of israel this day  give me a man  that we may fight togeth  when king saul heard these word  he was dismay  and all the men of israel  when they saw the man  fled from him and were sore afraid  david heard them talk among themselv  whisper and murmur  they were say   have ye seen this man that is come up  sure if anyon killeth him that man will the king make rich  perhap he will give him his daughter in marriag  and make his famili free in israel  david heard this  and he ask the men if it were so  it was sure so  they said   but  said david   who is this philistin  that he should defi the armi of the live god  and he was stir with anger  veri soon  some of the offic told the king about the youth who was ask so mani question  and who said that it was shame upon israel that a mere philistin should defi the armi of the live god  immedi saul sent for him  when david came befor saul  he said to the king   let no man  s heart fail becaus of him  thi servant will go and fight with this philistin  but saul look at david  and said   thou art not abl to go against this philistin  to fight with him  for thou art but a youth  and he has been a man of war from his youth  then david said to saul   onc i was keep my father  s sheep  and there came a lion  and a bear  and took a lamb out of the flock  and i went out after the lion  and struck him  and deliv the lamb out of his mouth  and when he aros against me  i caught him by the beard  and struck him  and slew him  thi servant slew both the lion and the bear  and this philistin shall be as one of them  for he hath defi the armi of the live god  the lord  who deliv me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear  he will deliv me out of the hand of this philistin   go  said saul   and the lord be with thee  and he arm david with his own armour  he put a helmet of brass upon his head  and arm him with a coat of mail  but when david gird his sword upon his armour  and tri to walk  he said to saul   i cannot go with these  for i am not use to them  and he put them off  then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stone out of the brook  and put them in a shepherd  s bag which he had  and his sling was in his hand  and he went out and drew near to the philistin  and the philistin came on and drew near to david  and the man that bore his shield went befor him  and when the philistin look about and saw david  he disdain him  for david was but a boy  and ruddi  and of a fair counten  and he said to david   am i a dog  that thou comest to me with a cudgel  and with curs he cri out again   come to me  and i will give thi flesh unto the fowl of the air  and to the beast of the field  but david look at him  and answer   thou comest to me with a sword  and with a spear  and with a shield  but i come to thee in the

cottag window far  how mani god  s hidden servant are  littl gottlieb across the north sea  in a countri call germani  live a littl boy name gottlieb  his father had die when he was but a babi  and although from earli morn till late at night his mother sat pli her needl  she found it difficult inde to provid food and cloth and shelter for her littl boy and herself  gottlieb was not old enough to work  but he would often sit on a small stool at his mother  s feet and dream about the wonder thing he would do for his dear mother when he grew to be a man  and she was comfort as she look upon her boy  and the thought that she was work for him often gave strength to her tire finger  but one night gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usual troubl  everi now and then she would sigh  and a tear would trickl down her cheek  the littl boy had grown quick to read these sign of distress  and he thought   christma will be here soon  and dear mother is think of what a sad time it will be  what would gottlieb have given to be abl to comfort his mother  he could onli sit and brood  while his young heart swell and a lump rose in his throat at the thought that he could do noth  present  howev  a happi fanci came to him  was not the christ child born on christma day  and did not he send good gift to men on his birthday  but then came the thought   he will never find us  our home is so mean and small  it seem foolish to hope  but a boy is not long cast down  and as gottlieb sat dream  a happi inspir came to him  steal soft from the room he took paper and pen  for he had learnt to write  and spelt out  word after word  a letter which he address to the christ child  you may be sure that the postman was puzzl what to do with this letter when he sort it out of the heap in the letter  box  perhap the burgomast would know the right thing to do  so the postman took the letter to the great bur man who live in the big hous and wore a gold chain round his neck  the burgomast open the envelop  and as he read the letter written in the trembl hand of a child  tear came into his eye  but he spoke gruffli enough to the postman   this must be a foolish boy  a small one  i have no doubt  soon christma morn dawn  and gottlieb woke veri earli  but other were up befor him  for  to his surpris  he saw a strang gentleman with his mother  his wonder eye soon perceiv other unusu object  for the hearth was pile with wood  and the tabl was load with food and dainti such as he had never even imagin  gottlieb enter the room just as his mother threw herself at the stranger  s feet to bless him for his generous good to the widow and orphan   nay  give me no thank  worthi dame  said the visitor   rather be grate to your littl son  and to the good lord to whom he wrote for aid  then he turn to gottlieb with a smile   you see that although you wrote to the christ child  your prayer for aid came onli to the burgomast  the gift you ask for are here  but they come from my hand  but gottlieb answer him humbl   nay  sir  the christ child sent them  for he put the thought in your heart  how the fir tree becam the christma tree when you stand round the christma tree and look long at the toy hang from the prick branch  it doe not occur to you to ask whi it is alway this particular tree that is so honour at christma  the dark green fir look so majest when laden with bright toy and lit up by christma candl  that perhap it is not easi to believ that it is the most modest of tree  but so it is  and becaus of it humil it was chosen to bear christma gift to the children  this is the stori  when the christ child was born  all peopl  anim  tree  and other plant felt that a great happi had come into the world  and truli  the heaven father had sent with the holi babe his bless of peac and goodwil to all  everi day peopl came to see the sweet babe  bring present in their hand  by the stabl wherein lay the christ child stood three tree  and as the peopl came and went under their spread branch  they thought that they  too  would like to give present to the child  said the palm   i will choos my biggest leaf and place it as a fan besid the manger to waft soft air to the child   and i  said the oliv   i will sprinkl sweet  smell oil over him   what can i give to the child  ask the fir   you  said the other   you have noth to offer  your needl would prick the wee babe  and your tear are sticki  this made the poor fir veri unhappi inde  and it said  sad   yes  you are right  i have noth that would be good enough to offer to the christ child  now  quit near to the tree had stood an angel  who had heard all that had pass  he was move to piti the fir  who was so lowli and without envi of the other tree  and he resolv to help it  high in the dark of the heaven the star were begin to twinkl  and the angel beg some of the littl one to come down and rest upon the branch of the fir  this they were glad to do  and their silveri light shone among the branch just like christma candl  from where he lay the christ child could see the great dark even world and the darker form of the tree keep watch  like faith guardian  besid the open door of the stabl  and to it delight the fir tree saw the face of the babe illumin with a heaven smile as he look upon the twinkl light  the christ child did not forget the love sight  and long afterward he bade that to celebr his birthday there should be place in everi hous a fir tree  which might be lit up with candl to shine for the children as the star shone for him on his first birthday  was not the fir tree rich reward for it meek  sure there is no other tree that shine on so mani happi face  the diamond and the dewdrop a cost diamond  that had onc sparkl in a ladi  s ring  lay in a field amid tall grass and oxey daisi  just abov it  was a big dewdrop that clung timid to a nod grass  blade  overhead  the blaze sun shone in all his noonday glori  ever sinc the first pink blush of dawn  the modest dewdrop had gaze fix down upon the rich gem  but fear to address a person of such exalt consequ  at last  a larg beetl  dure his rambl  chanc to espi the diamond  and he also recognis him to be some one of great rank and import   sire  he said  make a low bow   permit your humbl servant to offer you greet   tha  nks  respond the diamond in languid tone of affect  as the beetl rais his head from his profound bow  his gaze happen to alight upon the dewdrop   a relat of your  i presum  sire  he remark affabl  wave one of his feeler in the direct of the dewdrop  the diamond burst into a rude  contemptu laugh   quit too absurd  i declar  he exclaim loftili   but there  what can you expect from a low  grovel beetl  away  sir  pass on  your veri presenc is distast to me  the idea of place me upon the same level  in the same famili  as a low  born  mean  insignific  utter valueless  here the diamond fair choke for breath   but has he not beauti exact like your own  sire  the beetl ventur to interpos  though with a veri timid air   beau  ty  flash the diamond  with fine disdain  the impud fellow mere ape and imit me  howev  it is some small consol to rememb that  imit is the sincerest flatteri  but  even allowing him to possess it  mere beauti without rank is ridicul and worthless  a boat without water  a carriag  but no horses  a well  but never a winch  such is beauti without rank and wealth  there is no real worth apart from rank and wealth  combin beauti  rank  and wealth  and you have the whole world at your feet  now you know the secret of the world worship me  and the diamond sparkl and gleam with vivid  violet flash  so that the beetl was glad to shade his eye  the poor dewdrop had listen silent to all that had pass  and felt so wound  that at last he wish he never had been born  slowli a bright tear fell and splash the dust  just then  a skylark flutter to the ground and eager dart his beak at the diamond   ala  he pipe  with a great sob of disappoint   what i thought to be a precious dewdrop is onli a worthless diamond  my throat is parch for want of water  i must die of thirst   realli  the world will never get over your loss  cruelli sneer the

ask  the lark rais his droop head   oh  my precious  precious friend  if you will  you can save my life   open your mouth then  and the dewdrop slid from the blade of grass  tumbl into the parch beak  and was eager swallow   ah  well  well  ponder the beetl as he continu his homeward way   i  ve been taught a lesson that i shall not easili forget  yes  yes  simpl worth is far better than rank or wealth without modesti and unselfish  and there is no true beauti where these virtu are absent
