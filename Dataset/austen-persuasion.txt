thirteen year had pass away sinc ladi elliot  s death  and they were still near neighbour and intim friend  and one remain a widow  the other a widow  that ladi russel  of steadi age and charact  and extrem well provid for  should have no thought of a second marriag  need no apolog to the public  which is rather apt to be unreason discont when a woman doe marri again  than when she doe not  but

vanish earli  and as even in it height  her father had found littl to admir in her   so total differ were her delic featur and mild dark eye from his own  there could be noth in them  now that she was fade and thin  to excit his esteem  he had never indulg much hope  he had now none  of ever read her name in ani other page of his favourit work  all equal of allianc must rest with elizabeth  for mari had mere connect herself with an old countri famili of respect and larg fortun  and had therefor given all the honour and receiv none  elizabeth would  one day or other  marri suitabl  it sometim happen that a woman is handsom at twenti  nine than she was ten year befor  and  general speak  if there has been neither ill health nor anxieti  it is a time of life at which scarc ani charm is lost  it was so with elizabeth  still the same handsom miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen year ago  and sir walter might be excus  therefor  in forget her age  or  at least  be deem onli half a fool  for think himself and elizabeth as bloom as ever  amidst the wreck of the good look of everybodi els  for he could plain see how old all the rest of his famili and acquaint were grow  ann haggard  mari coars  everi face in the neighbourhood worst  and the rapid increas of the crow  s foot about ladi russel  s templ had long been a distress to him  elizabeth did not quit equal her father in person content  thirteen year had seen her mistress of kellynch hall  presid and direct with a self  possess and decis which could never have given the idea of her be younger than she was  for thirteen year had she been do the honour  and lay down the domest law at home  and lead the way to the chais and four  and walk immedi after ladi russel out of all the draw  room and dine  room in the countri  thirteen winter  revolv frost had seen her open everi ball of credit which a scanti neighbourhood afford  and thirteen spring shewn their blossom  as she travel up to london with her father  for a few week  annual enjoy of the great world  she had the remembr of all this  she had the conscious of be nine  and  twenti to give her some regret and some apprehens  she was fulli satisfi of be still quit as handsom as ever  but she felt her approach to the year of danger  and would have rejoic to be certain of be proper solicit by baronet  blood within the next twelvemonth or two  then might she again take up the book of book with as much enjoy as in her earli youth  but now she like it not  alway to be present with the date of her own birth and see no marriag follow but that of a youngest sister  made the book an evil  and more than onc  when her father had left it open on the tabl near her  had she close it  with avert eye  and push it away  she had had a disappoint  moreov  which that book  and especi the histori of her own famili  must ever present the remembr of  the heir presumpt  the veri william walter elliot  esq  whose right had been so generous support by her father  had disappoint her  she had  while a veri young girl  as soon as she had known him to be  in the event of her have no brother  the futur baronet  meant to marri him  and her father had alway meant that she should  he had not been known to them as a boy  but soon after ladi elliot  s death  sir walter had sought the acquaint  and though his overtur had not been met with ani warmth  he had persev in seek it  make allow for the modest draw  back of youth  and  in one of their spring excurs to london  when elizabeth was in her first bloom  mr elliot had been forc into the introduct  he was at that time a veri young man  just engag in the studi of the law  and elizabeth found him extrem agreeabl  and everi plan in his favour was confirm  he was invit to kellynch hall  he was talk of and expect all the rest of the year  but he never came  the follow spring he was seen again in town  found equal agreeabl  again encourag  invit  and expect  and again he did not come  and the next tide were that he was marri  instead of push his fortun in the line mark out for the heir of the hous of elliot  he had purchas independ by unit himself to a rich woman of inferior birth  sir walter has resent it  as the head of the hous  he felt that he ought to have been consult  especi after take the young man so public by the hand   for they must have been seen togeth  he observ   onc at tattersal  s  and twice in the lobbi of the hous of common  his disapprob was express  but appar veri littl regard  mr elliot had attempt no apolog  and shewn himself as unsolicit of be longer notic by the famili  as sir walter consid him unworthi of it  all acquaint between them had ceas  this veri awkward histori of mr elliot was still  after an interv of sever year  felt with anger by elizabeth  who had like the man for himself  and still more for be her father  s heir  and whose strong famili pride could see onli in him a proper match for sir walter elliot  s eldest daughter  there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feel could have so will acknowledg as an equal  yet so miser had he conduct himself  that though she was at this present time  the summer of 1814  wear black ribbon for his wife  she could not admit him to be worth think of again  the disgrac of his first marriag might  perhap  as there was no reason to suppos it perpetu by offspr  have been got over  had he not done wors  but he had  as by the accustomari intervent of kind friend  they had been inform  spoken most disrespect of them all  most slight and contemptu of the veri blood he belong to  and the honour which were hereaft to be his own  this could not be pardon  such were elizabeth elliot  s sentiment and sensat  such the care to alloy  the agit to vari  the same and the eleg  the prosper and the nothing of her scene of life  such the feel to give interest to a long  unev resid in one countri circl  to fill the vacanc which there were no habit of util abroad  no talent or accomplish for home  to occupi  but now  anoth occup and solicitud of mind was begin to be ad to these  her father was grow distress for money  she knew  that when he now took up the baronetag  it was to drive the heavi bill of his tradespeopl  and the unwelcom hint of mr shepherd  his agent  from his thought  the kellynch properti was good  but not equal to sir walter  s apprehens of the state requir in it possessor  while ladi elliot live  there had been method  moder  and economi  which had just kept him within his incom  but with her had die all such right  minded  and from that period he had been constant exceed it  it had not been possibl for him to spend less  he had done noth but what sir walter elliot was imperi call on to do  but blameless as he was  he was not onli grow dread in debt  but was hear of it so often  that it becam vain to attempt conceal it longer  even partial  from his daughter  he had given her some hint of it the last spring in town  he had gone so far even as to say   can we retrench  doe it occur to you that there is ani one articl in which we can retrench  and elizabeth  to do her justic  had  in the first ardour of femal alarm  set serious to think what could be done  and had final propos these two branch of economi  to cut off some unnecessari chariti  and to refrain from new furnish the draw  room  to which expedi she afterward ad the happi thought of their take no present down to ann  as had been the usual year custom  but these measur  howev good in themselv  were insuffici for the real extent of the evil  the whole of which sir walter found himself oblig to confess to her soon afterward  elizabeth had noth to propos of deeper efficaci  she felt herself ill  use and unfortun  as did her father  and they were neither of them abl to devis ani mean of lessen their expens without compromis their digniti  or relinquish their comfort in a way not to be born  there was onli a small part of his estat that sir walter could dispos of  but had everi acr been alien  it would have made no differ  he had condescend to mortgag as far as he had the power  but he would never condescend to sell  no  he would never disgrac his name so far  the kellynch estat should be transmit whole and entir  as he had receiv it  their two confidenti friend  mr shepherd  who live in the neighbour market town  and ladi russel  were call to advis them  and both father and daughter seem to expect that someth should be struck out by one or the other to remov their embarrass and reduc their expenditur  without involv the loss of ani indulg of tast or pride  chapter 2 mr shepherd  a civil  cautious lawyer  who  whatev might be his hold or his view on sir walter  would rather have the disagre prompt by anybodi els  excus himself from offer the slightest hint  and onli beg leav to recommend an implicit refer to the excel judgement of ladi russel  from whose known good sens he fulli expect to have just such resolut measur advis as he meant to see final adopt  ladi russel was most anxious zealous on the subject  and gave it much serious consider  she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abil  whose difficulti in come to ani decis in this instanc were great  from the opposit of two lead principl  she was of strict integr herself  with a delic sens of honour  but she was as desir of save sir walter  s feel  as solicit for the credit of the famili  as aristocrat in her idea of what was due to them  as anybodi of sens and honesti could well be  she was a benevol  charit  good woman  and capabl of strong attach  most correct in her conduct  strict in her notion of decorum  and with manner that were held a standard of good  breed  she had a cultiv mind  and was  general speak  ration and consist  but she had prejudic on the side of ancestri  she had a valu for rank and consequ  which blind her a littl to the fault of those who possess them  herself the widow of onli a knight  she gave the digniti of a baronet all it due  and sir walter  independ of his claim as an old acquaint  an attent neighbour  an oblig landlord  the husband of her veri dear friend  the father of ann and her sister  was  as be sir walter  in her apprehens  entitl to a great deal of compass and consider under his present difficulti  they must retrench  that did not admit of a doubt  but she was veri anxious to have it done with the least possibl pain to him and elizabeth  she drew up plan of economi  she made exact calcul  and she did what nobodi els thought of do  she consult ann  who never seem consid by the other as have ani interest in the question  she consult  and in a degre was influenc by her in mark out the scheme of retrench which was at last submit to sir walter  everi emend of ann  s had been on the side of honesti against import  she want more vigor measur  a more complet reform  a quicker releas from debt  a much higher tone of indiffer for everyth but justic and equiti   if we can persuad your father to all this  said ladi russel  look over her paper   much may be done  if he will adopt these regul  in seven year he will be clear  and i hope we may be abl to convinc him and elizabeth  that kellynch hall has a respect in itself which cannot be affect by these reduct  and that the true digniti of sir walter elliot will be veri far from lessen in the eye of sensibl peopl  by act like a man of principl  what will he be do  in fact  but what veri mani of our first famili have done  or ought to do  there will be noth singular in his case  and it is singular which often make the worst part of our suffer  as it alway doe of our conduct  i have great hope of prevail  we must be serious and decid  for after all  the person who has contract debt must pay them  and though a great deal is due to the feel of the gentleman  and the head of a hous  like your father  there is still more due to the charact of an honest man  this was the principl on which ann want her father to be proceed  his friend to be urg him  she consid it as an act of indispens duti to clear away the claim of creditor with all the expedit which the most comprehens retrench could secur  and saw no digniti in anyth short of it  she want it to be prescrib  and felt as a duti  she rate ladi russel  s influenc high  and as to the sever degre of self  denial which her own conscienc prompt  she believ there might be littl more difficulti in persuad them to a complet  than to half a reform  her knowledg of her father and elizabeth inclin her to think that the sacrific of one pair of hors would be hard less pain than of both  and so on  through the whole list of ladi russel  s too gentl reduct  how ann  s more rigid requisit might have been taken is of littl consequ  ladi russel  s had no success at all  could not be put up with  were not to be born   what  everi comfort of life knock off  journey  london  servant  hors  tabl  contract and restrict everi where  to live no longer with the decenc even of a privat gentleman  no  he would sooner quit kellynch hall at onc  than remain in it on such disgrac term   quit kellynch hall  the hint was immedi taken up by mr shepherd  whose interest was involv in the realiti of sir walter  s retrench  and who was perfect persuad that noth would be done without a chang of abod   sinc the idea had been start in the veri quarter which ought to dictat  he had no scrupl  he said   in confess his judgement to be entir on that side  it did not appear to him that sir walter could materi alter his style of live in a hous which had such a charact of hospit and ancient digniti to support  in ani other place sir walter might judg for himself  and would be look up to  as regul the mode of life in whatev way he might choos to model his household  sir walter would quit kellynch hall  and after a veri few day more of doubt and indecis  the great question of whither he should go was settl  and the first outlin of this import chang made out  there had been three altern  london  bath  or anoth hous in the countri  all ann  s wish had been for the latter  a small hous in their own neighbourhood  where they might still have ladi russel  s societi  still be near mari  and still have the pleasur of sometim see the lawn and grove of kellynch  was the object of her ambit  but the usual fate of ann attend her  in have someth veri opposit from her inclin fix on  she dislik bath  and did not think it agre with her  and bath was to be her home  sir walter had at first thought more of london  but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trust in london  and had been skil enough to dissuad him from it  and make bath prefer  it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predica  he might there be import at compar littl expens  two materi advantag of bath over london had of cours been given all their weight  it more conveni distanc from kellynch  onli fifti mile  and ladi russel  s spend some part of everi winter there  and to the veri great satisfact of ladi russel  whose first view on the project chang had been for bath  sir walter and elizabeth were induc to believ that they should lose neither consequ nor enjoy by settl there  ladi russel felt oblig to oppos her dear ann  s known wish  it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small hous in his own neighbourhood  ann herself would have found the mortif of it more than she foresaw  and to sir walter  s feel they must have been dread  and with regard to ann  s dislik of bath  she consid it as a prejudic and mistak aris  first  from the circumst of her have been three year at school there  after her mother  s death  and second  from her happen to be not in perfect good spirit the onli winter which she had afterward spent there with herself  ladi russel was fond of bath  in short  and dispos to think it must suit them all  and as to her young friend  s health  by pass all the warm month with her at kellynch lodg  everi danger would be avoid  and it was in fact  a chang which must do both health and spirit good  ann had been too littl from home  too littl seen  her spirit were not high  a larger societi would improv them  she want her to be more known  the undesir of ani other hous in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certain much strengthen by one part  and a veri materi part of the scheme  which had been happili engraft on the begin  he was not onli to quit his home  but to see it in the hand of other  a trial of fortitud  which stronger head than sir walter  s have found too much  kellynch hall was to be let  this  howev  was a profound secret  not to be breath beyond their own circl  sir walter could not have born the degrad of be known to design let his hous  mr shepherd had onc mention the word  advertis  but never dare approach it again  sir walter spurn the idea of it be offer in ani manner  forbad the slightest hint be drop of his have such an intent  and it was onli on the supposit of his be spontan solicit by some most unexception applic  on his own term  and as a great favour  that he would let it at all  how quick come the reason for approv what we like  ladi russel had anoth excel one at hand  for be extrem glad that sir walter and his famili were to remov from the countri  elizabeth had been late form an intimaci  which she wish to see interrupt  it was with the daughter of mr shepherd  who had return  after an unprosper marriag  to her father  s hous  with the addit burden of two children  she was a clever young woman  who understood the art of pleas  the art of pleas  at least  at kellynch hall  and who had made herself so accept to miss elliot  as to have been alreadi stay there more than onc  in spite of all that ladi russel  who thought it a friendship quit out of place  could hint of caution and reserv  ladi russel  inde  had scarc ani influenc with elizabeth  and seem to love her  rather becaus she would love her  than becaus elizabeth deserv it  she had never receiv from her more than outward attent  noth beyond the observ of complais  had never succeed in ani point which she want to carri  against previous inclin  she had been repeat veri earnest in tri to get ann includ in the visit to london  sensibl open to all the injustic and all the discredit of the selfish arrang which shut her out  and on mani lesser occas had endeavour to give elizabeth the advantag of her own better judgement and experi  but alway in vain  elizabeth would go her own way  and never had she pursu it in more decid opposit to ladi russel than in this select of mrs clay  turn from the societi of so deserv a sister  to bestow her affect and confid on one who ought to have been noth to her but the object of distant civil  from situat  mrs clay was  in ladi russel  s estim  a veri unequ  and in her charact she believ a veri danger companion  and a remov that would leav mrs clay behind  and bring a choic of more suitabl intim within miss elliot  s reach  was therefor an object of first  rate import  chapter 3  i must take leav to observ  sir walter  said mr shepherd one morn at kellynch hall  as he laid down the newspap   that the present junctur is much in our favour  this peac will be turn all our rich naval offic ashor  they will be all want a home  could not be a better time  sir walter  for have a choic of tenant  veri respons tenant  mani a nobl fortun has been made dure the war  if a rich admir were to come in our way  sir walter   he would be a veri lucki man  shepherd  repli sir walter   that  s all i have to remark  a prize inde would kellynch hall be to him  rather the greatest prize of all  let him have taken ever so mani befor  hey  shepherd  mr shepherd laugh  as he knew he must  at this wit  and then ad   i presum to observ  sir walter  that  in the way of busi  gentlemen of the navi are well to deal with  i have had a littl knowledg of their method of do busi  and i am free to confess that they have veri liber notion  and are as like to make desir tenant as ani set of peopl one should meet with  therefor  sir walter  what i would take leav to suggest is  that if in consequ of ani rumour get abroad of your intent  which must be contempl as a possibl thing  becaus we know how difficult it is to keep the action and design of one part of the world from the notic and curios of the other  consequ has it tax  i  john shepherd  might conceal ani famili  matter that i chose  for nobodi would think it worth their while to observ me  but sir walter elliot has eye upon him which it may be veri difficult to elud  and therefor  thus much i ventur upon  that it will not great surpris me if  with all our caution  some rumour of the truth should get abroad  in the supposit of which  as i was go to observ  sinc applic will unquestion follow  i should think ani from our wealthi naval command particular worth attend to  and beg leav to add  that two hour will bring me over at ani time  to save you the troubl of repli  sir walter onli nod  but soon afterward  rise and pace the room  he observ sarcast   there are few among the gentlemen of the navi  i imagin  who would not be surpris to find themselv in a hous of this descript   they would look around them  no doubt  and bless their good fortun  said mrs clay  for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over  noth be of so much use to mrs clay  s health as a drive to kellynch   but i quit agre with my father in think a sailor might be a veri desir tenant  i have known a good deal of the profess  and besid their liber  they are so neat and care in all their way  these valuabl pictur of your  sir walter  if you chose to leav them  would be perfect safe  everyth in and about the hous would be taken such excel care of  the garden and shrubberi would be kept in almost as high order as they are now  you need not be afraid  miss elliot  of your own sweet flower garden be neglect   as to all that  rejoin sir walter coolli   suppos i were induc to let my hous  i have by no mean made up my mind as to the privileg to be annex to it  i am not particular dispos to favour a tenant  the park would be open to him of cours  and few navi offic  or men of ani other descript  can have had such a rang  but what restrict i might impos on the use of the pleasur  ground  is anoth thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberi be alway approach  and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden  i am veri littl dispos to grant a tenant of kellynch hall ani extraordinari favour  i assur you  be he sailor or soldier  after a short paus  mr shepherd presum to say   in all these case  there are establish usag which make everyth plain and easi between landlord and tenant  your interest  sir walter  is in pretti safe hand  depend upon me for take care that no tenant has more than his just right  i ventur to hint  that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own  as john shepherd will be for him  here ann spoke   the navi  i think  who have done so much for us  have at least an equal claim with ani other set of men  for all the comfort and all the privileg which ani home can give  sailor work hard enough for their comfort  we must all allow   veri true  veri true  what miss ann say  is veri true  was mr shepherd  s rejoind  and  oh  certain  was his daughter  s  but sir walter  s remark was  soon afterward   the profess has it util  but i should be sorri to see ani friend of mine belong to it   inde  was the repli  and with a look of surpris   yes  it is in two point offens to me  i have two strong ground of object to it  first  as be the mean of bring person of obscur birth into undu distinct  and rais men to honour which their father and grandfath never dreamt of  and second  as it cut up a man  s youth and vigour most horribl  a sailor grow old sooner than ani other man  i have observ it all my life  a man is in greater danger in the navi of be insult by the rise of one whose father  his father might have disdain to speak to  and of becom prematur an object of disgust himself  than in ani other line  one day last spring  in town  i was in compani with two men  strike instanc of what i am talk of  lord st ive  whose father we all know to have been a countri curat  without bread to eat  i was to give place to lord st ive  and a certain admir baldwin  the most deplor  look personag you can imagin  his face the colour of mahogani  rough and rug to the last degre  all line and wrinkl  nine grey hair of a side  and noth but a dab of powder at top   in the name of heaven  who is that old fellow  said i to a friend of mine who was stand near   sir basil morley   old fellow  cri sir basil   it is admir baldwin  what do you take his age to be   sixti  said i   or perhap sixti  two   forti  repli sir basil   forti  and no more  pictur to yourselv my amaz  i shall not easili forget admir baldwin  i never saw quit so wretch an exampl of what a sea  fare life can do  but to a degre  i know it is the same with them all  they are all knock about  and expos to everi climat  and everi weather  till they are not fit to be seen  it is a piti they are not knock on the head at onc  befor they reach admir baldwin  s age   nay  sir walter  cri mrs clay   this is be sever inde  have a littl merci on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsom  the sea is no beautifi  certain  sailor do grow old betim  i have observ it  they soon lose the look of youth  but then  is not it the same with mani other profess  perhap most other  soldier  in activ servic  are not at all better off  and even in the quieter profess  there is a toil and a labour of the mind  if not of the bodi  which seldom leav a man  s look to the natur effect of time  the lawyer plod  quit care  worn  the physician is up at all hour  and travel in all weather  and even the clergyman  she stopt a moment to consid what might do for the clergyman  and even the clergyman  you know is oblig

was indispos  and forese that she should not have a day  s health all the autumn  entreat  or rather requir her  for it was hard entreati  to come to uppercross cottag  and bear her compani as long as she should want her  instead of go to bath   i cannot possibl do without ann  was mari  s reason  and elizabeth  s repli was   then i am sure ann had better stay  for nobodi will want her in bath  to

not go to bath till ladi russel took her  and that all the interven time should be divid between uppercross cottag and kellynch lodg  so far all was perfect right  but ladi russel was almost startl by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan  when it burst on her  which was  mrs clay  s be engag to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth  as a most import and valuabl assist to the latter in all the busi befor her  ladi russel was extrem sorri that such a measur should have been resort to at all  wonder  griev  and fear  and the affront it contain to ann  in mrs clay  s be of so much use  while ann could be of none  was a veri sore aggrav  ann herself was becom harden to such affront  but she felt the imprud of the arrang quit as keen as ladi russel  with a great deal of quiet observ  and a knowledg  which she often wish less  of her father  s charact  she was sensibl that result the most serious to his famili from the intimaci were more than possibl  she did not imagin that her

could not excus herself from tri to make it percept to her sister  she had littl hope of success  but elizabeth  who in the event of such a revers would be so much more to be piti than herself  should never  she thought  have reason to reproach her for give no warn  she spoke  and seem onli to offend  elizabeth could not conceiv how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her  and indign answer for each parti  s perfect know their situat   mrs clay  said she  warm   never forget who she is  and as i am rather better acquaint with her sentiment than you can be  i can assur you  that upon the

himself singl so long for our sake  need be suspect now  if mrs clay were a veri beauti woman  i grant you  it might be wrong to have her so much with me  not that anyth in the world  i am sure  would induc my father to make a degrad match  but he might be render unhappi  but poor mrs clay who  with all her merit  can never have been reckon toler pretti  i realli think poor mrs clay may be stay

such ceremoni with peopl i know so well as mrs and the miss musgrov   oh  but they ought to call upon you as soon as possibl  they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  howev  we may as well go and sit with them a littl while  and when we have that over  we can enjoy our walk  ann had alway thought such a style of intercours high imprud  but she had ceas to endeavour to check it  from believ that  though there were on each side continu subject of offenc  neither famili could now do without it  to the great hous accord they went  to sit the full half hour in the old  fashion squar parlour  with a small carpet and shine floor  to which the present daughter of the hous were gradual give the proper air of confus by a grand piano  fort and a harp  flower  stand and littl tabl place in everi direct  oh  could the origin of the portrait against the wainscot  could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladi in blue satin have seen what was go on  have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neat  the portrait themselv seem to be stare in astonish  the musgrov  like their hous  were in a state of alter  perhap of improv  the father and mother were in the old english style  and the young peopl in the new  mr and mrs musgrov were a veri good sort of peopl  friend and hospit  not much educ  and not at all eleg  their children had more modern mind and manner  there was a numer famili  but the onli two grown up  except charl  were henrietta and louisa  young ladi of nineteen and twenti  who had brought from school at exet all the usual stock of accomplish  and were now like thousand of other young ladi  live to be fashion  happi  and merri  their dress had everi advantag  their face were rather pretti  their spirit extrem good  their manner unembarrass and pleasant  they were of consequ at home  and favourit abroad  ann alway contempl them as some of the happiest creatur of her acquaint  but still  save as we all are  by some comfort feel of superior from wish for the possibl of exchang  she would not have given up her own more eleg and cultiv mind for all their enjoy  and envi them noth but that seem perfect good understand and agreement togeth  that good  humour mutual affect  of which she had known so littl herself with either of her sister  they were receiv with great cordial  noth seem amiss on the side of the great hous famili  which was general  as ann veri well knew  the least to blame  the half hour was chat away pleasant enough  and she was not at all surpris at the end of it  to have their walk parti join by both the miss musgrov  at mari  s particular invit  chapter 6 ann had not want this visit to uppercross  to learn that a remov from one set of peopl to anoth  though at a distanc of onli three mile  will often includ a total chang of convers  opinion  and idea  she had never been stay there befor  without be struck by it  or without wish that other elliot could have her advantag in see how unknown  or unconsid there  were the affair which at kellynch hall were treat as of such general public and pervad interest  yet  with all this experi  she believ she must now submit to feel that anoth lesson  in the art of know our own nothing beyond our own circl  was becom necessari for her  for certain  come as she did  with a heart full of the subject which had been complet occupi both hous in kellynch for mani week  she had expect rather more curios and sympathi than she found in the separ but veri similar remark of mr and mrs musgrov   so  miss ann  sir walter and your sister are gone  and what part of bath do you think they will settl in  and this  without much wait for an answer  or in the young ladi  addit of   i hope we shall be in bath in the winter  but rememb  papa  if we do go  we must be in a good situat  none of your queen squar for us  or in the anxious supplement from mari  of   upon my word  i shall be pretti well off  when you are all gone away to be happi at bath  she could onli resolv to avoid such self  delus in futur  and think with heighten gratitud of the extraordinari bless of have one such truli sympathis friend as ladi russel  the mr musgrov had their own game to guard  and to destroy  their own hors  dog  and newspap to engag them  and the femal were fulli occupi in all the other common subject of housekeep  neighbour  dress  danc  and music  she acknowledg it to be veri fit  that everi littl social commonwealth should dictat it own matter of discours  and hope  ere long  to becom a not unworthi member of the one she was now transplant into  with the prospect of spend at least two month at uppercross  it was high incumb on her to cloth her imagin  her memori  and all her idea in as much of uppercross as possibl  she had no dread of these two month  mari was not so repuls and unsist as elizabeth  nor so inaccess to all influenc of her  neither was there anyth among the other compon part of the cottag inim to comfort  she was alway on friend term with her brother  in  law  and in the children  who love her near as well  and respect her a great deal more than their mother  she had an object of interest  amus  and wholesom exert  charl musgrov was civil and agreeabl  in sens and temper he was undoubt superior to his wife  but not of power  or convers  or grace  to make the past  as they were connect togeth  at all a danger contempl  though  at the same time  ann could believ  with ladi russel  that a more equal match might have great improv him  and that a woman of real understand might have given more consequ to his charact  and more use  ration  and eleg to his habit and pursuit  as it was  he did noth with much zeal  but sport  and his time was otherwis trifl away  without benefit from book or anyth els  he had veri good spirit  which never seem much affect by his wife  s occasion low  bore with her unreason sometim to ann  s admir  and upon the whole  though there was veri often a littl disagr  in which she had sometim more share than she wish  be appeal to by both parti  they might pass for a happi coupl  they were alway perfect agre in the want of more money  and a strong inclin for a handsom present from his father  but here  as on most topic  he had the superior  for while mari thought it a great shame that such a present was not made  he alway contend for his father  s have mani other use for his money  and a right to spend it as he like  as to the manag of their children  his theori was much better than his wife  s  and his practic not so bad   i could manag them veri well  if it were not for mari  s interfer  was what ann often heard him say  and had a good deal of faith in  but when listen in turn to mari  s reproach of  charl spoil the children so that i cannot get them into ani order  she never had the smallest temptat to say   veri true  one of the least agreeabl circumst of her resid there was her be treat with too much confid by all parti  and be too much in the secret of the complaint of each hous  known to have some influenc with her sister  she was continu request  or at least receiv hint to exert it  beyond what was practic   i wish you could persuad mari not to be alway fanci herself ill  was charl  s languag  and  in an unhappi mood  thus spoke mari   i do believ if charl were to see me die  he would not think there was anyth the matter with me  i am sure  ann  if you would  you might persuad him that i realli am veri ill  a great deal wors than i ever own  mari  s declar was   i hate send the children to the great hous  though their grandmamma is alway want to see them  for she humour and indulg them to such a degre  and give them so much trash and sweet thing  that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day  and mrs musgrov took the first opportun of be alon with ann  to say   oh  miss ann  i cannot help wish mrs charl had a littl of your method with those children  they are quit differ creatur with you  but to be sure  in general they are so spoilt  it is a piti you cannot put your sister in the way of manag them  they are as fine healthi children as ever were seen  poor littl dear  without partial  but mrs charl know no more how they should be treat  bless me  how troublesom they are sometim  i assur you  miss ann  it prevent my wish to see them at our hous so often as i otherwis should  i believ mrs charl is not quit pleas with my not invit them often  but you know it is veri bad to have children with one that one is oblig to be check everi moment   don  t do this  and  don  t do that  or that one can onli keep in toler order by more cake than is good for them  she had this communic  moreov  from mari   mrs musgrov think all her servant so steadi  that it would be high treason to call it in question  but i am sure  without exagger  that her upper hous  maid and laundri  maid  instead of be in their busi  are gad about the villag  all day long  i meet them wherev i go  and i declar  i never go twice into my nurseri without see someth of them  if jemima were not the trustiest  steadiest creatur in the world  it would be enough to spoil her  for she tell me  they are alway tempt her to take a walk with them  and on mrs musgrov  s side  it was   i make a rule of never interf in ani of my daughter  in  law  s concern  for i know it would not do  but i shall tell you  miss ann  becaus you may be abl to set thing to right  that i have no veri good opinion of mrs charl  s nurseri  maid  i hear strang stori of her  she is alway upon the gad  and from my own knowledg  i can declar  she is such a fine  dress ladi  that she is enough to ruin ani servant she come near  mrs charl quit swear by her  i know  but i just give you this hint  that you may be upon the watch  becaus  if you see anyth amiss  you need not be afraid of mention it  again  it was mari  s complaint  that mrs musgrov was veri apt not to give her the preced that was her due  when they dine at the great hous with other famili  and she did not see ani reason whi she was to be consid so much at home as to lose her place  and one day when ann was walk with onli the musgrov  one of them after talk of rank  peopl of rank  and jealousi of rank  said   i have no scrupl of observ to you  how nonsens some person are about their place  becaus all the world know how easi and indiffer you are about it  but i wish anybodi could give mari a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so veri tenaci  especi if she would not be alway put herself forward to take place of mamma  nobodi doubt her right to have preced of mamma  but it would be more becom in her not to be alway insist on it  it is not that mamma care about it the least in the world  but i know it is taken notic of by mani person  how was ann to set all these matter to right  she could do littl more than listen patient  soften everi grievanc  and excus each to the other  give them all hint of the forbear necessari between such near neighbour  and make those hint broadest which were meant for her sister  s benefit  in all other respect  her visit began and proceed veri well  her own spirit improv by chang of place and subject  by be remov three mile from kellynch  mari  s ailment lessen by have a constant companion  and their daili intercours with the other famili  sinc there was neither superior affect  confid  nor employ in the cottag  to be interrupt by it  was rather an advantag  it was certain carri near as far as possibl  for they met everi morn  and hard ever spent an even asund  but she believ they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgrov  s respect form in the usual place  or without the talk  laugh  and sing of their daughter  she play a great deal better than either of the miss musgrov  but have no voic  no knowledg of the harp  and no fond parent  to sit by and fanci themselv delight  her perform was littl thought of  onli out of civil  or to refresh the other  as she was well awar  she knew that when she play she was give pleasur onli to herself  but this was no new sensat  except one short period of her life  she had never  sinc the age of fourteen  never sinc the loss of her dear mother  known the happi of be listen to  or encourag by ani just appreci or real tast  in music she had been alway use to feel alon in the world  and mr and mrs musgrov  s fond partial for their own daughter  perform  and total indiffer to ani other person  s  gave her much more pleasur for their sake  than mortif for her own  the parti at the great hous was sometim increas by other compani  the neighbourhood was not larg  but the musgrov were visit by everybodi  and had more dinner  parti  and more caller  more visitor by invit and by chanc  than ani other famili  there were more complet popular  the girl were wild for danc  and the even end  occasion  in an unpremedit littl ball  there was a famili of cousin within a walk of uppercross  in less affluent circumst  who depend on the musgrov for all their pleasur  they would come at ani time  and help play at anyth  or danc anywher  and ann  veri much prefer the offic of musician to a more activ post  play countri danc to them by the hour togeth  a kind which alway recommend her music power to the notic of mr and mrs musgrov more than anyth els  and often drew this compliment   well done  miss ann  veri well done inde  lord bless me  how those littl finger of your fli about  so pass the first three week  michaelma came  and now ann  s heart must be in kellynch again  a belov home made over to other  all the precious room and furnitur  grove  and prospect  begin to own other eye and other limb  she could not think of much els on the 29th of septemb  and she had this sympathet touch in the even from mari  who  on have occas to note down the day of the month  exclaim   dear me  is not this the day the croft were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did not think of it befor  how low it make me  the croft took possess with true naval alert  and were to be visit  mari deplor the necess for herself   nobodi knew how much she should suffer  she should put it off as long as she could  but was not easi till she had talk charl into drive her over on an earli day  and was in a veri anim  comfort state of imaginari agit  when she came back  ann had veri sincer rejoic in there be no mean of her go  she wish  howev to see the croft  and was glad to be within when the visit was return  they came  the master of the hous was not at home  but the two sister were togeth  and as it chanc that mrs croft fell to the share of ann  while the admir sat by mari  and made himself veri agreeabl by his good  humour notic of her littl boy  she was well abl to watch for a like  and if it fail her in the featur  to catch it in the voic  or in the turn of sentiment and express  mrs croft  though neither tall nor fat  had a squar  upright  and vigour of form  which gave import to her person  she had bright dark eye  good teeth  and altogeth an agreeabl face  though her redden and weather  beaten complexion  the consequ of her have been almost as much at sea as her husband  made her seem to have live some year longer in the world than her real eight  and  thirti  her manner were open  easi  and decid  like one who had no distrust of herself  and no doubt of what to do  without ani approach to coars  howev  or ani want of good humour  ann gave her credit  inde  for feel of great consider toward herself  in all that relat to kellynch  and it pleas her  especi  as she had satisfi herself in the veri first half minut  in the instant even of introduct  that there was not the smallest symptom of ani knowledg or suspicion on mrs croft  s side  to give a bias of ani sort  she was quit easi on that head  and consequ full of strength and courag  till for a moment electrifi by mrs croft  s sudden say   it was you  and not your sister  i find  that my brother had the pleasur of be acquaint with  when he was in this countri  ann hope she had outliv the age of blush  but the age of emot she certain had not   perhap you may not have heard that he is marri  ad mrs croft  she could now answer as she ought  and was happi to feel  when mrs croft  s next word explain it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke  that she had said noth which might not do for either brother  she immedi felt how reason it was  that mrs croft should be think and speak of edward  and not of frederick  and with shame at her own forget appli herself to the knowledg of their former neighbour  s present state with proper interest  the rest was all tranquil  till  just as they were move  she heard the admir say to mari   we are expect a brother of mrs croft  s here soon  i dare say you know him by name  he was cut short by the eager attack of the littl boy  cling to him like an old friend  and declar he should not go  and be too much engross by propos of carri them away in his coat pocket   c  to have anoth moment for finish or recollect what he had begun  ann was left to persuad herself  as well as she could  that the same brother must still be in question  she could not  howev  reach such a degre of certainti  as not to be anxious to hear whether anyth had been said on the subject at the other hous  where the croft had previous been call  the folk of the great hous were to spend the even of this day at the cottag  and it be now too late in the year for such visit to be made on foot  the coach was begin to be listen for  when the youngest miss musgrov walk in  that she was come to apolog  and that they should have to spend the even by themselv  was the first black idea  and mari was quit readi to be affront  when louisa made all right by say  that she onli came on foot  to leav more room for the harp  which was bring in the carriag   and i will tell you our reason  she ad   and all about it  i am come on to give you notic  that papa and mamma are out of spirit this even  especi mamma  she is think so much of poor richard  and we agre it would be best to have the harp  for it seem to amus her more than the piano  fort  i will tell you whi she is out of spirit  when the croft call this morn   they call here afterward  did not they  they happen to say  that her brother  captain wentworth  is just return to england  or paid off  or someth  and is come to see them almost direct  and most unluckili it came into mamma  s head  when they were gone  that wentworth  or someth veri like it  was the name of poor richard  s captain at one time  i do not know when or where  but a great while befor he die  poor fellow  and upon look over his letter and thing  she found it was so  and is perfect sure that this must be the veri man  and her head is quit full of it  and of poor richard  so we must be as merri as we can  that she may not be dwell upon such gloomi thing  the real circumst of this pathet piec of famili histori were  that the musgrov had had the ill fortun of a veri troublesom  hopeless son  and the good fortun to lose him befor he reach his twentieth year  that he had been sent to sea becaus he was stupid and unmanag on shore  that he had been veri littl care for at ani time by his famili  though quit as much as he deserv  seldom heard of  and scarc at all regret  when the intellig of his death abroad had work it way to uppercross  two year befor  he had  in fact  though his sister were now do all they could for him  by call him  poor richard  been noth better than a thick  head  unfeel  unprofit dick musgrov  who had never done anyth to entitl himself to more than the abbrevi of his name  live or dead  he had been sever year at sea  and had  in the cours of those remov to which all midshipmen are liabl  and especi such midshipmen as everi captain wish to get rid of  been six month on board captain frederick wentworth  s frigat  the laconia  and from the laconia he had  under the influenc of his captain  written the onli two letter which his father and mother had ever receiv from him dure the whole of his absenc  that is to say  the onli two disinterest letter  all the rest had been mere applic for money  in each letter he had spoken well of his captain  but yet  so littl were they in the habit of attend to such matter  so unobserv and incuri were they as to the name of men or ship  that it had made scarc ani impress at the time  and that mrs musgrov should have been sudden struck  this veri day  with a recollect of the name of wentworth  as connect with her son  seem one of those extraordinari burst of mind which do sometim occur  she had gone to her letter  and found it all as she suppos  and the re  perus of these letter  after so long an interv  her poor son gone for ever  and all the strength of his fault forgotten  had affect her spirit exceed  and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hear of his death  mr musgrov was  in a lesser degre  affect likewis  and when they reach the cottag  they were evid in want  first  of be listen to anew on this subject  and afterward  of all the relief which cheer companion could give them  to hear them talk so much of captain wentworth  repeat his name so often  puzzl over past year  and at last ascertain that it might  that it probabl would  turn out to be the veri same captain wentworth whom they recollect meet  onc or twice  after their come back from clifton  a veri fine young man  but they could not say whether it was seven or eight year ago  was a new sort of trial to ann  s nerv  she found  howev  that it was one to which she must inur herself  sinc he actual was expect in the countri  she must teach herself to be insens on such point  and not onli did it appear that he was expect  and speedili  but the musgrov  in their warm gratitud for the kind he had shewn poor dick  and veri high respect for his charact  stamp as it was by poor dick  s have been six month under his care  and mention him in strong  though not perfect well  spelt prais  as  a fine dash felow  onli two perticular about the schoolmast  were bent on introduc themselv  and seek his acquaint  as soon as they could hear of his arriv  the resolut of do so help to form the comfort of their even  chapter 7 a veri few day more  and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch  and mr musgrov had call on him  and come back warm in his prais  and he was engag with the croft to dine at uppercross  by the end of anoth week  it had been a great disappoint to mr musgrov to find that no earlier day could be fix  so impati was he to shew his gratitud  by see captain wentworth under his own roof  and welcom him to all that was strongest and best in his cellar  but a week must pass  onli a week  in ann  s reckon  and then  she suppos  they must meet  and soon she began to wish that she could feel secur even for a week  captain wentworth made a veri earli return to mr musgrov  s civil  and she was all but call there in the same half hour  she and mari were actual set forward for the great hous  where  as she afterward learnt  they must inevit have found him  when they were stop by the eldest boy  s be at that moment brought home in consequ of a bad fall  the child  s situat put the visit entir asid  but she could not hear of her escap with indiffer  even in the midst of the serious anxieti which they afterward felt on his account  his collar  bone was found to be disloc  and such injuri receiv in the back  as rous the most alarm idea  it was an afternoon of distress  and ann had everi thing to do at onc  the apothecari to send for  the father to have pursu and inform  the mother to support and keep from hyster  the servant to control  the youngest child to banish  and the poor suffer one to attend and sooth  besid send  as soon as she recollect it  proper notic to the other hous  which brought her an access rather of frighten  enquir companion  than of veri use assist  her brother  s return was the first comfort  he could take best care of his wife  and the second bless was the arriv of the apothecari  till he came and had examin the child  their apprehens were the wors for be vagu  they suspect great injuri  but knew not where  but now the collar  bone was soon replac  and though mr robinson felt and felt  and rub  and look grave  and spoke low word both to the father and the aunt  still they were all to hope the best  and to be abl to part and eat their dinner in toler eas of mind  and then it was  just befor they part  that the two young aunt were abl so far to digress from their nephew  s state  as to give the inform of captain wentworth  s visit  stay five minut behind their father and mother  to endeavour to express how perfect delight they were with him  how much handsom  how infinit more agreeabl they thought him than ani individu among their male acquaint  who had been at all a favourit befor  how glad they had been to hear papa invit him to stay dinner  how sorri when he said it was quit out of his power  and how glad again when he had promis in repli to papa and mamma  s farther press invit to come and dine with them on the morrow  actual on the morrow  and he had promis it in so pleasant a manner  as if he felt all the motiv of their attent just as he ought  and in short  he had look and said everyth with such exquisit grace  that they could assur them all  their head were both turn by him  and off they ran  quit as full of glee as of love  and appar more full of captain wentworth than of littl charl  the same stori and the same raptur were repeat  when the two girl came with their father  through the gloom of the even  to make enquiri  and mr musgrov  no longer under the first uneasi about his heir  could add his confirm and prais  and hope there would be now no occas for put captain wentworth off  and onli be sorri to think that the cottag parti  probabl  would not like to leav the littl boy  to give him the meet   oh no  as to leav the littl boy  both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought  and ann  in the joy of the escap  could not help ad her warm protest to their  charl musgrov  inde  afterward  shew more of inclin   the child was go on so well  and he wish so much to be introduc to captain wentworth  that  perhap  he might join them in the even  he would not dine from home  but he might walk in for half an hour  but in this he was eager oppos by his wife  with  oh  no  inde  charl  i cannot bear to have you go away  onli think if anyth should happen  the child had a good night  and was go on well the next day  it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injuri had been done to the spine  but mr robinson found noth to increas alarm  and charl musgrov began  consequ  to feel no necess for longer confin  the child was to be kept in bed and amus as quiet as possibl  but what was there for a father to do  this was quit a femal case  and it would be high absurd in him  who could be of no use at home  to shut himself up  his father veri much wish him to meet captain wentworth  and there be no suffici reason against it  he ought to go  and it end in his make a bold  public declar  when he came in from shoot  of his mean to dress direct  and dine at the other hous   noth can be go on better than the child  said he   so i told my father  just now  that i would come  and he thought me quit right  your sister be with you  my love  i have no scrupl at all  you would not like to leav him yourself  but you see i can be of no use  ann will send

to teaz him  she said noth  therefor  till he was out of the room  but as soon as there was onli ann to hear   so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselv  with this poor sick child  and not a creatur come near us all the even  i knew how it would be  this is alway my luck  if there is anyth disagre go on men are alway sure to get out of it  and charl is as bad as ani of them  veri unfeel  i must say it is veri unfeel of him to be run away from his poor littl boy  talk of his be go on so well  how doe he know that he is go on well  or that there may not be a sudden chang half an hour henc  i did not think charl would have been so unfeel  so here he is to go away and enjoy himself  and becaus i am the poor mother  i am not to be allow to stir  and yet  i am sure  i am more unfit than anybodi els to be about the child  my be the mother is the veri reason whi my feel should not be tri  i am not at all equal to it  you saw how hyster i was yesterday   but that was onli the effect of the sudden of your alarm  of the shock  you will not be hyster again  i dare say we shall have noth to distress us  i perfect understand mr robinson  s direct  and have no fear  and inde  mari  i cannot wonder at your husband  nurs doe not belong to a man  it is not his provinc  a sick child is alway the mother  s properti  her own feel general make it so   i hope i am as fond of my

his papa can  and whi should not i  jemima is so care  and she could send us word everi hour how he was  i realli think charl might as well have told his father we would all come  i am not more alarm

want her to join them in the even  when the child might be at rest for the night  and kind urg her to let him come and fetch her  but she was quit unpersuad  and this be the case  she had ere long the pleasur of see them set off togeth in high spirit  they were gone  she hope  to be happi  howev odd construct such happi might seem  as for herself  she was left with as mani sensat of comfort  as

she would have like to know how he felt as to a meet  perhap indiffer  if indiffer could exist under such circumst  he must be either indiffer or unwil  had he wish ever to see her again  he need not

her brother and sister came back delight with their new acquaint  and their visit in general  there had been music  sing  talk  laugh  all that was most agreeabl  charm manner in captain wentworth  no

whisper of mrs musgrov  s who  overcom by fond regret  could not help say   ah  miss ann  if it had pleas heaven to spare my poor son  i dare say he would have been just such anoth by this time  ann suppress a smile  and listen kind  while mrs musgrov reliev her heart a littl more  and for a few minut  therefor  could not keep pace with the convers of the other  when she could let her attent take

of find out the ship that captain wentworth had command   your first was the asp  i rememb  we will look for the asp   you will not find her there  quit worn out and broken up  i was the last man who

and then  with send a few hundr men to sea  in a ship not fit to be employ  but they have a great mani to provid for  and among the thousand that may just as well go to the bottom as not  it is imposs for them to distinguish the veri set who may be least miss   phoo  phoo  cri the admir   what stuff these young fellow talk  never was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloop

interest than his   i felt my luck  admir  i assur you  repli captain wentworth  serious   i was as well satisfi with my appoint as you can desir  it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea  a veri great object  i want to be do someth   to be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashor for half a year togeth  if a man had not a wife  he soon want to be afloat again   but  captain wentworth  cri louisa   how vex you must have been when you came to the asp  to see what an old thing they had given you   i knew pretti well what she was befor that day  said he  smile   i had no more discoveri to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of ani old peliss  which you had seen lent about among half your acquaint ever sinc you could rememb  and which at

the make of me  and i never had two day of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her  and after take privat enough to be veri entertain  i had the good luck in my passag home the next autumn  to fall in with the veri french frigat i want  i brought her into plymouth  and here anoth instanc of luck  we had not been six hour in the sound  when a gale came on  which last four day and night  and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time  our touch with the great nation not have much improv our condit  four  and  twenti hour later  and i should onli have been a gallant captain wentworth  in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspap  and be lost in onli a sloop  nobodi would have thought about me  ann  s shudder were to herself alon  but the miss musgrov could be as open as they were sincer  in their exclam of piti and horror   and so then  i suppos  said mrs musgrov  in a low voic  as if think aloud   so then he went away to the laconia  and there he met with our poor boy  charl  my dear   beckon him to her   do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother  i alway forgot   it was at gibraltar  mother  i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltar  with a recommend from his former captain to captain wentworth   oh  but  charl  tell captain wentworth  he need not be afraid of mention poor dick befor me  for it would be rather a pleasur to hear him talk of by such a good friend  charl  be somewhat more mind of the probabl of the case  onli nod in repli  and walk away  the girl were now hunt for the laconia  and captain wentworth could not deni himself the pleasur of take the precious volum into his own hand to save them the troubl  and onc more read aloud the littl statement of her name and rate  and present non

such a love cruis togeth off the western island  poor harvill  sister  you know how much he want money  wors than myself  he had a wife  excel fellow  i shall never forget his happi  he felt it all  so much for her sake  i wish for him again the next summer  when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean   and i am sure  sir  said mrs musgrov   it was a lucki day for us  when you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forget what you did  her feel made her speak low  and captain wentworth  hear onli in part  and probabl not have dick musgrov at all near his thought  look rather in suspens  and as if wait for more   my brother  whisper one of the girl   mamma is think of poor richard   poor dear fellow  continu mrs musgrov   he was grown so steadi  and such an excel correspond  while he was under your care  ah  it would have been a happi thing  if he had never left you  i assur you  captain wentworth  we are veri sorri he ever left you  there was a momentari express in captain wentworth  s face at this speech  a certain glanc of his bright eye  and curl of his handsom mouth  which convinc ann  that instead of share in mrs musgrov  s kind wish  as to her son  he had probabl been at some pain to get rid of him  but it was too transient an indulg of self  amus to be detect by ani who understood him less than herself  in anoth moment he was perfect collect and serious  and almost instant afterward come up to the sofa  on which she and mrs musgrov were sit  took a place by the latter  and enter into convers with her  in a low voic  about her son  do it with so much sympathi and natur grace  as shew the kindest consider for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent  s feel  they were actual on the same sofa  for mrs musgrov had most readili made room for him  they were divid onli by mrs musgrov  it was no insignific barrier  inde  mrs musgrov was of a comfort  substanti size  infinit more fit by natur to express good cheer and good humour  than tender and sentiment  and while the agit of ann  s slender form  and pensiv face  may be consid as veri complet screen  captain wentworth should be allow some credit for the self  command with which he attend to her larg fat sigh over the destini of a son  whom aliv nobodi had care for  person size and mental sorrow have certain no necessari proport  a larg bulki figur has as good a right to be in deep afflict  as the most grace set of limb in the world  but  fair or not fair  there are unbecom conjunct  which reason will patron in vain  which tast cannot toler  which ridicul will seiz  the admir  after take two or three refresh turn about the room with his hand behind him  be call to order by his wife  now came up to captain wentworth  and without ani observ of what he might be interrupt  think onli of his own thought  began with   if you had been a week later at lisbon  last spring  frederick  you would have been ask to give a passag to ladi mari grierson and her daughter   should i  i am glad i was not a week later then  the admir abus him for his want of gallantri  he defend himself  though profess that he would never will admit ani ladi on board a ship of his  except for a ball  or a visit  which a few hour might comprehend   but  if i know myself  said he   this is from no want of gallantri toward them  it is rather from feel how imposs it is  with all one  s effort  and all one  s sacrific  to make the accommod on board such as women ought to have  there can be no want of gallantri  admir  in rate the claim of women to everi person comfort high  and this is what i do  i hate to hear of women on board  or to see them on board  and no ship under my command shall ever convey a famili of ladi anywher  if i can help it  this brought his sister upon him   oh  frederick  but i cannot believ it of you   all idl refin   women may be as comfort on board  as in the best hous in england  i believ i have live as much on board as most women  and i know noth superior to the accommod of a man  of  war  i declar i have not a comfort or an indulg about me  even at kellynch hall   with a kind bow to ann   beyond what i alway had in most of the ship i have live in  and they have been five altogeth   noth to the purpos  repli her brother   you were live with your husband  and were the onli woman on board   but you  yourself  brought mrs harvill  her sister  her cousin  and three children  round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was this superfin  extraordinari sort of gallantri of your then   all merg in my friendship  sophia  i would assist ani brother offic  s wife that i could  and i would bring anyth of harvill  s from the world  s end  if he want it  but do not imagin that i did not feel it an evil in itself   depend upon it  they were all perfect comfort   i might not like them the better for that perhap  such a number of women and children have no right to be comfort on board   my dear frederick  you are talk quit idl  pray  what would becom of us poor sailor  wive  who often want to be convey to one port or anoth  after our husband  if everybodi had your feel   my feel  you see  did not prevent my take mrs harvill and all her famili to plymouth   but i hate to hear you talk so like a fine gentleman  and as if women were all fine ladi  instead of ration creatur  we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our day   ah  my dear  said the admir   when he had got a wife  he will sing a differ tune  when he is marri  if we have the good luck to live to anoth war  we shall see him do as you and i  and a great mani

bermuda or bahama  you know  the west indi  mrs musgrov had not a word to say in dissent  she could not accus herself of have ever call them anyth in the whole cours of her life   and i do assur you  ma  am  pursu mrs croft   that noth can exceed the accommod of a man  of  war  i speak  you know  of the higher rate  when you come to a frigat  of cours  you are more confin  though ani reason woman may be perfect happi in one of them  and i can safe say  that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship  while we were togeth  you know  there was noth to be fear  thank god  i have alway been bless with excel health  and no climat disagre with me  a littl disord alway the first twenti  four hour of go to sea  but never knew what sick was afterward  the onli time i ever realli suffer in bodi or mind  the onli time that i ever fanci myself unwel  or had ani idea of danger  was the winter that i pass by myself at deal  when the admir  captain croft then  was in the north sea  i live in perpetu fright at that time  and had all manner of imaginari complaint from not know what to do with myself  or when i should hear from him next  but as long as we could be togeth  noth ever

quit of your opinion  i know what it is  for mr musgrov alway attend the assiz  and i am so glad when they are over  and he is safe back again  the even end with danc  on it be propos  ann offer her servic  as usual  and though her eye would sometim fill with tear as she sat at the instrument  she was extrem glad to be employ  and desir noth in return but to be unobserv  it was a merri  joyous parti  and no one seem in higher spirit than captain wentworth  she felt that he had everi thing to elev him which general attent and defer  and especi the attent of all the young women  could do  the miss hayter  the femal of the famili of cousin alreadi mention  were appar admit to the honour of be in love with him  and as for henrietta and louisa  they both seem so entir occupi by him  that noth but the continu appear of the most perfect good  will between themselv could have made it credibl that they were not decid rival  if he were a littl spoilt by such univers  such eager admir  who could wonder  these were some of the thought which occupi ann  while her finger were mechan at work  proceed for half an hour togeth  equal without error  and without conscious  onc she felt that he was look at herself  observ her alter featur  perhap  tri to trace in them the ruin of the face which had onc charm him  and onc she knew that he must have spoken of her  she was hard awar of it  till she heard the answer  but then she was sure of his have ask his partner whether miss elliot never danc  the answer was   oh  no  never  she has quit given up danc  she had rather play  she is never tire of play  onc  too  he spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the danc be over  and he had sat down to tri to make out an air which he wish to give the miss musgrov an idea of  unintent she return to that part of the room  he saw her  and  instant rise  said  with studi polit   i beg your pardon  madam  this is your seat  and though she immedi drew back with a decid negat  he was not to be induc to sit down again  ann did not wish for more of such look and speech  his cold polit  his ceremoni grace  were wors than anyth  chapter 9 captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home  to stay as long as he like  be as thorough the object of the admir  s fratern kind as of his wife  s  he had intend  on first arriv  to proceed veri soon into shropshir  and visit the brother settl in that countri  but the attract of uppercross induc him to put this off  there was so much of friendli  and of flatteri  and of everyth most bewitch in his recept there  the old were so hospit  the young so agreeabl  that he could not but resolv to remain where he was  and take all the charm and perfect of edward  s wife upon credit a littl longer  it was soon uppercross with him almost everi day  the musgrov could hard be more readi to invit than he to come  particular in the morn  when he had no companion at home  for the admir and mrs croft were general out of door togeth  interest themselv in their new possess  their grass  and their sheep  and dawdl about in a way not endur to a third person  or drive out in a gig  late ad to their establish  hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgrov and their depend  it was unvari  warm admir everywher  but this intim foot was not more than establish  when a certain charl hayter return among them  to be a good deal disturb by it  and to think captain wentworth veri much in the way  charl hayter was the eldest of all the cousin  and a veri amiabl  pleas young man  between whom and henrietta there had been a consider appear of attach previous to captain wentworth  s introduct  he was in order  and have a curaci in the neighbourhood  where resid was not requir  live at his father  s hous  onli two mile from uppercross  a short absenc from home had left his fair one unguard by his attent at this critic period  and when he came back he had the pain of find veri alter manner  and of see captain wentworth  mrs musgrov and mrs hayter were sister  they had each had money  but their marriag had made a materi differ in their degre of consequ  mr hayter had some properti of his own  but it was insignific compar with mr musgrov  s  and while the musgrov were in the first class of societi in the countri  the young hayter would  from their parent  inferior  retir  and unpolish way of live  and their own defect educ  have been hard in ani class at all  but for their connexion with uppercross  this eldest son of cours except  who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman  and who was veri superior in cultiv and manner to all the rest  the two famili had alway been on excel term  there be no pride on one side  and no envi on the other  and onli such a conscious of superior in the miss musgrov  as made them pleas to improv their cousin  charl  s attent to henrietta had been observ by her father and mother without ani disapprob   it would not be a great match for her  but if henrietta like him  and henrietta did seem to like him  henrietta fulli thought so herself  befor captain wentworth came  but from that time cousin charl had been veri much forgotten  which of the two sister was prefer by captain wentworth was as yet quit doubt  as far as ann  s observ reach  henrietta was perhap the prettiest  louisa had the higher spirit  and she knew not now  whether the more gentl or the more live charact were most like to attract him  mr and mrs musgrov  either from see littl  or from an entir confid in the discret of both their daughter  and of all the young men who came near them  seem to leav everyth to take it chanc  there was not the smallest appear of solicitud or remark about them in the mansion  hous  but it was differ at the cottag  the young coupl there were more dispos to specul and wonder  and captain wentworth had not been abov four or five time in the miss musgrov  compani  and charl hayter had but just reappear  when ann had to listen to the opinion of her brother and sister  as to which was the one like best  charl gave it for louisa  mari for henrietta  but quit agre that to have him marri either could be extrem delight  charl  had never seen a pleasant man in his life  and from what he had onc heard captain wentworth himself say  was veri sure that he had not made less than twenti thousand pound by the war  here was a fortun at onc  besid which  there would be the chanc of what might be done in ani futur war  and he was sure captain wentworth was as like a man to distinguish himself as ani offic in the navi  oh  it would be a capit match for either of his sister   upon my word it would  repli mari   dear me  if he should rise to ani veri great honour  if he should ever be made a baronet   ladi wentworth  sound veri well  that would be a nobl thing  inde  for henrietta  she would take place of me then  and henrietta would not dislik that  sir frederick and ladi wentworth  it would be but a new creation  howev  and i never think much of your new creation  it suit mari best to think henrietta the one prefer on the veri account of charl hayter  whose pretens she wish to see put an end to  she look down veri decid upon the hayter  and thought it would be quit a misfortun to have the exist connect between the famili renew  veri sad for herself and her children   you know  said she   i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta  and consid the allianc which the musgrov have made  she has no right to throw herself away  i do not think ani young woman has a right to make a choic that may be disagre and inconveni to the princip part of her famili  and be give bad connect to those who have not been use to them  and  pray  who is charl hayter  noth but a countri curat  a most improp match for miss musgrov of uppercross  her husband  howev  would not agre with her here  for besid have a regard for his cousin  charl hayter was an eldest son  and he saw thing as an eldest son himself   now you are take nonsens  mari  was therefor his answer   it would not be a great match for henrietta  but charl has a veri fair chanc  through the spicer  of get someth from the bishop in the cours of a year or two  and you will pleas to rememb  that he is the eldest son  whenev my uncl die  he step into veri pretti properti  the estat at winthrop is not less than two hundr and fifti acr  besid the farm near taunton  which is some of the best land in the countri  i grant you  that ani of them but charl would be a veri shock match for henrietta  and inde it could not be  he is the onli one that could be possibl  but he is a veri good  natur  good sort of a fellow  and whenev winthrop come into his hand  he will make a differ sort of place of it  and live in a veri differ sort of way  and with that properti  he will never be a contempt man  good  freehold properti  no  no  henrietta might do wors than marri charl hayter  and if she has him  and louisa can get captain wentworth  i shall be veri well satisfi   charl may say what he pleas  cri mari to ann  as soon as he was out of the room   but it would be shock to have henrietta marri charl hayter  a veri bad thing for her  and still wors for me  and therefor it is veri much to be wish that captain wentworth may soon put him quit out of her head  and i have veri littl doubt that he has  she took hard ani notic of charl hayter yesterday  i wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as to captain wentworth  s like louisa as well as henrietta  it is nonsens to say so  for he certain doe like henrietta a great deal the best  but charl is so posit  i wish you had been with us yesterday  for then you might have decid between us  and i am sure you would have thought as i did  unless you had been determin to give it against me  a dinner at mr musgrov  s had been the occas when all these thing should have been seen by ann  but she had staid at home  under the mix plea of a headach of her own  and some return of indisposit in littl charl  she had thought onli of avoid captain wentworth  but an escap from be appeal to as umpir was now ad to the advantag of a quiet even  as to captain wentworth  s view  she deem it of more consequ that he should know his own mind earli enough not to be endang the happi of either sister  or impeach his own honour  than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa  or louisa to henrietta  either of them would  in all probabl  make him an affection  good  humour wife  with regard to charl hayter  she had delicaci which must be pain by ani light of conduct in a well  mean young woman  and a heart to sympath in ani of the suffer it occas  but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the natur of her feel  the altern could not be understood too soon  charl hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortifi him in his cousin  s behaviour  she had too old a regard for him to be so wholli estrang as might in two meet extinguish everi past hope  and leav him noth to do but to keep away from uppercross  but there was such a chang as becam veri alarm  when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regard as the probabl caus  he had been absent onli two sunday  and when they part  had left her interest  even to the height of his wish  in his prospect of soon quit his present curaci  and obtain that of uppercross instead  it had then seem the object nearest her heart  that dr shirley  the rector  who for more than forti year had been zealous discharg all the duti of his offic  but was now grow too infirm for mani of them  should be quit fix on engag a curat  should make his curaci quit as good as he could afford  and should give charl hayter the promis of it  the advantag of his have to come onli to uppercross  instead of go six mile anoth way  of his have  in everi respect  a better curaci  of his belong to their dear dr shirley  and of dear  good dr shirley  s be reliev from the duti which he could no longer get through without most injuri fatigu  had been a great deal  even to louisa  but had been almost everyth to henrietta  when he came back  ala  the zeal of the busi was gone by  louisa could not listen at all to his account of a convers which he had just held with dr shirley  she was at a window  look out for captain wentworth  and even henrietta had at best onli a divid attent to give  and seem to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitud of the negoti   well  i am veri glad inde  but i alway thought you would have it  i alway thought you sure  it did not appear to me that  in short  you know  dr shirley must have a curat  and you had secur his promis  is he come  louisa  one morn  veri soon after the dinner at the musgrov  at which ann had not been present  captain wentworth walk into the draw  room at the cottag  where were onli herself and the littl invalid charl  who was lie on the sofa  the surpris of find himself almost alon with ann elliot  depriv his manner of their usual composur  he start  and could onli say   i thought the miss musgrov had been here  mrs musgrov told me i should find them here  befor he walk to the window to recollect himself  and feel how he ought to behav   they are up stair with my sister  they will be down in a few moment  i dare say  had been ann  s repli  in all the confus that was natur  and if the child had not call her to come and do someth for him  she would have been out of the room the next moment  and releas captain wentworth as well as herself  he continu at the window  and after calm and polit say   i hope the littl boy is better  was silent  she was oblig to kneel down by the sofa  and remain there to satisfi her patient  and thus they continu a few minut  when  to her veri great satisfact  she heard some other person cross the littl vestibul  she hope  on turn her head  to see the master of the hous  but it prove to be one much less calcul for make matter easi  charl hayter  probabl not at all better pleas by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of ann  she onli attempt to say   how do you do  will you not sit down  the other will be here present  captain wentworth  howev  came from his window  appar not ill  dispos for convers  but charl hayter soon put an end to his attempt by seat himself near the tabl  and take up the newspap  and captain wentworth return to his window  anoth minut brought anoth addit  the younger boy  a remark stout  forward child  of two year old  have got the door open for him by some one without  made his determin appear among them  and went straight to the sofa to see what was go on  and put in his claim to anyth good that might be give away  there be noth to eat  he could onli have some play  and as his aunt would not let him teas his sick brother  he began to fasten himself upon her  as she knelt  in such a way that  busi as she was about charl  she could not shake him off  she spoke to him  order  entreat  and insist in vain  onc she did contriv to push him away  but the boy had the greater pleasur in get upon her back again direct   walter  said she   get down this moment  you are extrem troublesom  i am veri angri with you   walter  cri charl hayter   whi do you not do as you are bid  do not you hear your aunt speak  come to me  walter  come to cousin charl  but not a bit did walter stir  in anoth moment  howev  she found herself in the state of be releas from him  some one was take him from her  though he had bent down her head so much  that his littl sturdi hand were unfasten from around her neck  and he was resolut born away  befor she knew that captain wentworth had done it  her sensat on the discoveri made her perfect speechless  she could not even thank him  she could onli hang over littl charl  with most disord feel  his kind in step forward to her relief  the manner  the silenc in which it had pass  the littl particular of the circumst  with the convict soon forc on her by the nois he was studious make with the child  that he meant to avoid hear her thank  and rather sought to testifi that her convers was the last of his want  produc such a confus of vari  but veri pain agit  as she could not recov from  till enabl by the entranc of mari and the miss musgrov to make over her littl patient to their care  and leav the room  she could not stay  it might have been an opportun of watch the love and jealousi of the four  they were now altogeth  but she could stay for none of it  it was evid that charl hayter was not well inclin toward captain wentworth  she had a strong impress of his have said  in a vext tone of voic  after captain wentworth  s interfer   you ought to have mind me  walter  i told you not to teaz your aunt  and could comprehend his regret that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself  but neither charl hayter  s feel  nor anybodi  s feel  could interest her  till she had a littl better arrang her own  she was asham of herself  quit asham of be so nervous  so overcom by such a trifl  but so it was  and it requir a long applic of solitud and reflect to recov her  chapter 10 other opportun of make her observ could not fail to occur  ann had soon been in compani with all the four togeth often enough to have an opinion  though too wise to acknowledg as much at home  where she knew it would have satisfi neither husband nor wife  for while she consid louisa to be rather the favourit  she could not but think  as far as she might dare to judg from memori and experi  that captain wentworth was not in love with either  they were more in love with him  yet there it was not love  it was a littl fever of admir  but it might  probabl must  end in love with some  charl hayter seem awar of be slight  and yet henrietta had sometim the air of be divid between them  ann long for the power of repres to them all what they were about  and of point out some of the evil they were expos themselv to  she did not attribut guil to ani  it was the highest satisfact to her to believ captain wentworth not in the least awar of the pain he was occas  there was no triumph  no piti triumph in his manner  he had  probabl  never heard  and never thought of ani claim of charl hayter  he was onli wrong in accept the attent  for accept must be the word  of two young women at onc  after a short struggl  howev  charl hayter seem to quit the field  three day had pass without his come onc to uppercross  a most decid chang  he had even refus one regular invit to dinner  and have been found on the occas by mr musgrov with some larg book befor him  mr and mrs musgrov were sure all could not be right  and talk  with grave face  of his studi himself to death  it was mari  s hope and belief that he had receiv a posit dismiss from henrietta  and her husband live under the constant depend of see him to  morrow  ann could onli feel that charl hayter was wise  one morn  about this time charl musgrov and captain wentworth be gone a  shoot togeth  as the sister in the cottag were sit quiet at work  they were visit at the window by the sister from the mansion  hous  it was a veri fine novemb day  and the miss musgrov came through the littl ground  and stop for no other purpos than to say  that they were go to take a long walk  and therefor conclud mari could not like to go with them  and when mari immedi repli  with some jealousi at not be suppos a good walker   oh  yes  i should like to join you veri much  i am veri fond of a long walk  ann felt persuad  by the look of the two girl  that it was precis what they did not wish  and admir again the sort of necess which the famili habit seem to produc  of everyth be to be communic  and everyth be to be done togeth  howev undesir and inconveni  she tri to dissuad mari from go  but in vain  and that be the case  thought it best to accept the miss musgrov  much more cordial invit to herself to go likewis  as she might be use in turn back with her sister  and lessen the interfer in ani plan of their own   i cannot imagin whi they should suppos i should not like a long walk  said mari  as she went up stair   everybodi is alway suppos that i am not a good walker  and yet they would not have been pleas  if we had refus to join them  when peopl come in this manner on purpos to ask us  how can one say no  just as they were set off  the gentlemen return  they had taken out a young dog  who had spoilt their sport  and sent them back earli  their time and strength  and spirit  were  therefor  exact readi for this walk  and they enter into it with pleasur  could ann have foreseen such a junction  she would have staid at home  but  from some feel of interest and curios  she fanci now that it was too late to retract  and the whole six set forward togeth in the direct chosen by the miss musgrov  who evid consid the walk as under their guidanc  ann  s object was  not to be in the way of anybodi  and where the narrow path across the field made mani separ necessari  to keep with her brother and sister  her pleasur in the walk must aris from the exercis and the day  from the view of the last smile of the year upon the tawni leav  and wither hedg  and from repeat to herself some few of the thousand poetic descript extant of autumn  that season of peculiar and inexhaust influenc on the mind of tast and tender  that season which had drawn from everi poet  worthi of be read  some attempt at descript  or some line of feel  she occupi her mind as much as possibl in such like muse and quotat  but it was not possibl  that when within reach of captain wentworth  s convers with either of the miss musgrov  she should not tri to hear it  yet she caught littl veri remark  it was mere live chat  such as ani young person  on an intim foot  might fall into  he was more engag with louisa than with henrietta  louisa certain put more forward for his notic than her sister  this distinct appear to increas  and there was one speech of louisa  s which struck her  after one of the mani prais of the day  which were continu burst forth  captain wentworth ad    what glorious weather for the admir and my sister  they meant to take a long drive this morn  perhap we may hail them from some of these hill  they talk of come into this side of the countri  i wonder whereabout they will upset to  day  oh  it doe happen veri often  i assur you  but my sister make noth of it  she would as liev be toss out as not   ah  you make the most of it  i know  cri louisa   but if it were realli so  i should do just the same in her place  if i love a man  as she love the admir  i would alway be with him  noth should ever separ us  and i would rather be overturn by him  than driven safe by anybodi els  it was spoken with enthusiasm   had you  cri he  catch the same tone   i honour you  and there was silenc between them for a littl while  ann could not immedi fall into a quotat again  the sweet scene of autumn were for a while put by  unless some tender sonnet  fraught with the apt analog of the declin year  with declin happi  and the imag of youth and hope  and spring  all gone togeth  bless her memori  she rous herself to say  as they struck by order into anoth path   is not this one of the way to winthrop  but nobodi heard  or  at least  nobodi answer her  winthrop  howev  or it environ  for young men are  sometim to be met with  stroll about near home  was their destin  and after anoth half mile of gradual ascent through larg enclosur  where the plough at work  and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteract the sweet of poetic despond  and mean to have spring again  they gain the summit of the most consider hill  which part uppercross and winthrop  and soon command a full view of the latter  at the foot of the hill on the other side  winthrop  without beauti and without digniti  was stretch befor them an indiffer hous  stand low  and hem in by the barn and build of a farm  yard  mari exclaim   bless me  here is winthrop  i declar i had no idea  well now  i think we had better turn back  i am excess tire  henrietta  conscious and asham  and see no cousin charl walk along ani path  or lean against ani gate  was readi to do as mari wish  but  no  said charl musgrov  and  no  no  cri louisa more eager  and take her sister asid  seem to be argu the matter warm  charl  in the meanwhil  was veri decid declar his resolut of call on his aunt  now that he was so near  and veri evid  though more fear  tri to induc his wife to go too  but this was one of the point on which the ladi shew her strength  and when he recommend the advantag of rest herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop  as she felt so tire  she resolut answer   oh  no  inde  walk up that hill again would do her more harm than ani sit down could do her good  and  in short  her look and manner declar  that go she would not  after a littl success of these sort of debat and consult  it was settl between charl and his two sister  that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minut  to see their aunt and cousin  while the rest of the parti wait for them at the top of the hill  louisa seem the princip arrang of the plan  and  as she went a littl way with them  down the hill  still talk to henrietta  mari took the opportun of look scorn around her  and say to captain wentworth   it is veri unpleas  have such connexion  but  i assur you  i have never been in the hous abov twice in my life  she receiv no other answer  than an artifici  assent smile  follow by a contemptu glanc  as he turn away  which ann perfect knew the mean of  the brow of the hill  where they remain  was a cheer spot  louisa return  and mari  find a comfort seat for herself on the step of a stile  was veri well satisfi so long as the other all stood about her  but when louisa drew captain wentworth away  to tri for a glean of nut in an adjoin hedg  row  and they were gone by degre quit out of sight and sound  mari was happi no longer  she quarrel with her own seat  was sure louisa had got a much better somewher  and noth could prevent her from go to look for a better also  she turn through the same gate  but could not see them  ann found a nice seat for her  on a dri sunni bank  under the hedg  row  in which she had no doubt of their still be  in some spot or other  mari sat down for a moment  but it would not do  she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewher els  and she would go on till she overtook her  ann  realli tire herself  was glad to sit down  and she veri soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedg  row  behind her  as if make their way back along the rough  wild sort of channel  down the centr  they were speak as they drew near  louisa  s voic was the first distinguish  she seem to be in the middl of some eager speech  what ann first heard was   and so  i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frighten from the visit by such nonsens  what  would i be turn back from do a thing that i had determin to do  and that i knew to be right  by the air and interfer of such a person  or of ani person i may say  no  i have no idea of be so easili persuad  when i have made up my mind  i have made it  and henrietta seem entir to have made up her to call at winthrop to  day  and yet  she was as near give it up  out of nonsens complais   she would have turn back then  but for you   she would inde  i am almost asham to say it   happi for her  to have such a mind as your at hand  after the hint you gave just now  which did but confirm my own observ  the last time i was in compani with him  i need not affect to have no comprehens of what is go on  i see that more than a mere duti morn visit to your aunt was in question  and woe betid him  and her too  when it come to thing of consequ  when they are place in circumst requir fortitud and strength of mind  if she have not resolut enough to resist idl interfer in such a trifl as this  your sister is an amiabl creatur  but your is the charact of decis and firm  i see  if you valu her conduct or happi  infus as much of your own spirit into her as you can  but this  no doubt  you have been alway do  it is the worst evil of too yield and indecis a charact  that no influenc over it can be depend on  you are never sure of a good impress be durabl  everybodi may sway it  let those who would be happi be firm  here is a nut  said he  catch one down from an upper bough   to exemplifi  a beauti glossi nut  which  bless with origin strength  has outliv all the storm of autumn  not a punctur  not a weak spot anywher  this nut  he continu  with play solemn   while so mani of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot  is still in possess of all the happi that a hazel nut can be suppos capabl of  then return to his former earnest tone   my first wish for all whom i am interest in  is that they should be firm  if louisa musgrov would be beauti and happi in her novemb of life  she will cherish all her present power of mind  he had done  and was unansw  it would have surpris ann if louisa could have readili answer such a speech  word of such interest  spoken with such serious warmth  she could imagin what louisa was feel  for herself  she fear to move  lest she should be seen  while she remain  a bush of low rambl holli protect her  and they were move on  befor they were beyond her hear  howev  louisa spoke again   mari is good  natur enough in mani respect  said she   but she doe sometim provok me excess  by her nonsens and pride  the elliot pride  she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride  we do so wish that charl had marri ann instead  i suppos you know he want to marri ann  after a moment  s paus  captain wentworth said   do you mean that she refus him   oh  yes  certain   when did that happen   i do not exact know  for henrietta and i were at school at the time  but i believ about a year befor he marri mari  i wish she had accept him  we should all have like her a great deal better  and papa and mamma alway think it was her great friend ladi russel  s do  that she did not  they think charl might not be learn and bookish enough to pleas ladi russel  and that therefor  she persuad ann to refus him  the sound were retreat  and ann distinguish no more  her own emot still kept her fix  she had much to recov from  befor she could move  the listen  s proverbi fate was not absolut her  she had heard no evil of herself  but she had heard a great deal of veri pain import  she saw how her own charact was consid by captain wentworth  and there had been just that degre of feel and curios about her in his manner which must give her extrem agit  as soon as she could  she went after mari  and have found  and walk back with her to their former station  by the stile  felt some comfort in their whole parti be immedi afterward collect  and onc more in motion togeth  her spirit want the solitud and silenc which onli number could give  charl and henrietta return  bring  as may be conjectur  charl hayter with them  the minutia of the busi ann could not attempt to understand  even captain wentworth did not seem admit to perfect confid here  but that there had been a withdraw on the gentleman  s side  and a relent on the ladi  s  and that they were now veri glad to be togeth again  did not admit a doubt  henrietta look a littl asham  but veri well pleas  charl hayter exceed happi  and they were devot to each other almost from the first instant of their all set forward for uppercross  everyth now mark out louisa for captain wentworth  noth could be plainer  and where mani divis were necessari  or even where they were not  they walk side by side near as much as the other two  in a long strip of meadow land  where there was ampl space for all  they were thus divid  form three distinct parti  and to that parti of the three which boast least anim  and least complais  ann necessarili belong  she join charl and mari  and was tire enough to be veri glad of charl  s other arm  but charl  though in veri good humour with her  was out of temper with his wife  mari had shewn herself disoblig to him  and was now to reap the consequ  which consequ was his drop her arm almost everi moment to cut off the head of some nettl in the hedg with his switch  and when mari began to complain of it  and lament her be ill  use  accord to custom  in be on the hedg side  while ann was never incommod on the other  he drop the arm of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentari glanc of  and they could hard get him along at all  this long meadow border a lane  which their footpath  at the end of it was to cross  and when the parti had all reach the gate of exit  the carriag advanc in the same direct  which had been some time heard  was just come up  and prove to be admir croft  s gig  he and his wife had taken their intend drive  and were return home  upon hear how long a walk the young peopl had engag in  they kind offer a seat to ani ladi who might be particular tire  it would save her a full mile  and they were go through uppercross  the invit was general  and general declin  the miss musgrov were not at all tire  and mari was either offend  by not be ask befor ani of the other  or what louisa call the elliot pride could not endur to make a third in a one hors chais  the walk parti had cross the lane  and were surmount an opposit stile  and the admir was put his hors in motion again  when captain wentworth clear the hedg in a moment to say someth to his sister  the someth might be guess by it effect   miss elliot  i am sure you are tire  cri mrs croft   do let us have the pleasur of take you home  here is excel room for three  i assur you  if we were all like you  i believ we might sit four  you must  inde  you must  ann was still in the lane  and though instinct begin to declin  she was not allow to proceed  the admir  s kind urgenc came in support of his wife  s  they would not be refus  they compress themselv into the smallest possibl space to leav her a corner  and captain wentworth  without say a word  turn to her  and quiet oblig her to be assist into the carriag  yes  he had done it  she was in the carriag  and felt that he had place her there  that his will and his hand had done it  that she owe it to his percept of her fatigu  and his resolut to give her rest  she was veri much affect by the view of his disposit toward her  which all these thing made appar  this littl circumst seem the complet of all that had gone befor  she understood him  he could not forgiv her  but he could not be unfeel  though condemn her for the past  and consid it with high and unjust resent  though perfect careless of her  and though becom attach to anoth  still he could not see her suffer  without the desir of give her relief  it was a remaind of former sentiment  it was an impuls of pure  though unacknowledg friendship  it was a proof of his own warm and amiabl heart  which she could not contempl without emot so compound of pleasur and pain  that she knew not which prevail  her answer to the kind and the remark of her companion were at first unconsci given  they had travel half their way along the rough lane  befor she was quit awak to what they said  she then found them talk of  frederick   he certain mean to have one or other of those two girl  sophi  said the admir   but there is no say which  he has been run after them  too  long enough  one would think  to make up his mind  ay  this come of the peac  if it were war now  he would have settl it long ago  we sailor  miss elliot  cannot afford to make long courtship in time of war  how mani day was it  my dear  between the first time of my see you and our sit down togeth in our lodg at north yarmouth   we had better not talk about it  my dear  repli mrs croft  pleasant   for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understand  she would never be persuad that we could be happi togeth  i had known you by charact  howev  long befor   well  and i had heard of you as a veri pretti girl  and what were we to wait for besid  i do not like have such thing so long in hand  i wish frederick would spread a littl more canvass  and bring us home one of these young ladi to kellynch  then there would alway be compani for them  and veri nice young ladi they both are  i hard know one from the other   veri good humour  unaffect girl  inde  said mrs croft  in a tone of calmer prais  such as made ann suspect that her keener power might not consid either of them as quit worthi of her brother   and a veri respect famili  one could not be connect with better peopl  my dear admir  that post  we shall certain take that post  but by coolli give the rein a better direct herself they happili pass the danger  and by onc afterward judici put out her hand they neither fell into a rut  nor ran foul of a dung  cart  and ann  with some amus at their style of drive  which she imagin no bad represent of the general guidanc of their affair  found herself safe deposit by them at the cottag  chapter 11 the time now approach for ladi russel  s return  the day was even fix  and ann  be engag to join her as soon as she was resettl  was look forward to an earli remov to kellynch  and begin to think how her own comfort was like to be affect by it  it would place her in the same villag with captain wentworth  within half a mile of him  they would have to frequent the same church  and there must be intercours between the two famili  this was against her  but on the other hand  he spent so much of his time at uppercross  that in remov thenc she might be consid rather as leav him behind  than as go toward him  and  upon the whole  she believ she must  on this interest question  be the gainer  almost as certain as in her chang of domest societi  in leav poor mari for ladi russel  she wish it might be possibl for her to avoid ever see captain wentworth at the hall  those room had wit former meet which would be brought too pain befor her  but she was yet more anxious for the possibl of ladi russel and captain wentworth never meet anywher  they did not like each other  and no renew of acquaint now could do ani good  and were ladi russel to see them togeth  she might think that he had too much self  possess  and she too littl  these point form her chief solicitud in anticip her remov from uppercross  where she felt she had been station quit long enough  her use to littl charl would alway give some sweet to the memori of her two month  visit there  but he was gain strength apac  and she had noth els to stay for  the

long  when they saw him come after them  with three companion  all well known alreadi  by descript  to be captain and mrs harvill  and a captain benwick  who was stay with them  captain benwick had some time ago been first lieuten of the laconia  and the account which captain wentworth had given of him  on his return from lyme befor  his warm prais of him as an excel young man and an offic  whom he had alway valu high  which must have stamp him well in the esteem of everi listen  had been follow by a littl histori of his privat life  which render him perfect interest in the eye of all the

 came at last  but fanni harvill did not live to know it  she had die the preced summer while he was at sea  captain wentworth believ it imposs for man to be more attach to woman than poor benwick had been to fanni harvill  or to be more deepli afflict under the dread chang  he consid his disposit as of the sort which must suffer heavili  unit veri strong feel with quiet  serious  and retir manner

his resolut of not go away  he would be as littl incumbr as possibl to captain and mrs harvill  but as to leav his sister in such a state  he neither ought  nor would  so far it was decid  and henrietta at first declar the same  she  howev  was soon persuad to think differ  the use of her stay  she who had not been abl to remain in louisa  s room  or to look at her  without suffer which made her wors than helpless  she was forc to acknowledg that she could do no good  yet was still unwil to be away  till  touch by the thought of her father and mother  she gave it up  she consent  she was anxious to be at home  the plan had reach this point  when ann  come quiet down from louisa  s room  could not but hear what follow  for the parlour door was open   then it is settl  musgrov  cri

full on leav kellynch  and which she had felt slight  and been compel to smother among the musgrov  were now becom but of secondari interest  she had late lost sight even of her father and sister and bath  their concern had been sunk under those of uppercross  and when ladi russel revert to their former hope and fear  and spoke her satisfact in the hous in camden place  which had been taken  and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them  ann would have been asham to have it known how much more she was think of lyme and louisa musgrov  and all her acquaint there  how much more interest to her was the home and the friendship of the harvill and captain benwick  than her own father  s hous in camden place  or her own sister  s intimaci with mrs clay  she was actual forc to exert herself to meet ladi russel with anyth like the appear of equal solicitud  on topic which had by natur the first claim on her  there was a littl awkward at first in their discours on anoth subject  they must speak of the accid at lyme  ladi russel had not been arriv five minut the day befor  when a full account of the whole had burst on her  but still it must be talk of  she must make enquiri  she must regret the imprud  lament the result  and captain wentworth  s name must be mention by both  ann was conscious of not do it so well as ladi russel  she could not speak the name  and look straight forward to ladi russel  s eye  till she had adopt the expedi of tell her briefli what she thought of the attach between him and louisa  when this was told  his name distress her no longer  ladi russel had onli to listen compos  and wish them happi  but intern her heart revel in angri pleasur  in pleas contempt  that the man who at twenti  three had seem to understand somewhat of the valu of an ann elliot  should  eight year afterward  be charm by a louisa musgrov  the first three or four day pass most quiet  with no circumst to mark them except the receipt of a note or two from lyme  which found their way to ann  she could not tell how  and brought a rather improv account of louisa  at the end of that period  ladi russel  s polit could repos no longer  and the fainter self  threaten of the past becam in a decid tone   i must call on mrs croft  i realli must call upon her soon  ann  have you courag to go with me  and pay a visit in that hous  it will be some trial to us both  ann did not shrink from it  on the contrari  she truli felt as she said  in observ   i think you are veri like to suffer the most of the two  your feel are less reconcil to the chang than

pain which ladi russel would suffer in enter the hous again  and return through the well  known apart  in such moment ann had no power of say to herself   these room ought to belong onli to us  oh  how fallen in their destin  how unworthili occupi  an ancient famili to be so driven away  stranger fill their place  no  except when she thought of her mother  and rememb where she had been use to

there was particular attent  the sad accid at lyme was soon the prevail topic  and on compar their latest account of the invalid  it appear that each ladi date her intellig from the same hour of yestermorn  that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday  the first time sinc the accid  had brought ann the last note  which she had not been abl to trace the exact step of  had staid a few hour and then return again to lyme  and without ani present intent of quit it ani more  he had enquir after her  she found  particular  had express his hope of miss elliot  s not be the wors for her exert  and had spoken of those exert as great  this was handsom  and gave her more pleasur than almost anyth els could have done  as to the sad catastroph itself  it could be canvass onli in one style by a coupl of steadi  sensibl women  whose judgement had to work on ascertain event  and it was perfect decid that it had been the consequ of much thoughtless and much imprud  that it effect were most alarm  and that it was fright to think  how long miss musgrov  s recoveri might yet be doubt  and how liabl she would still remain to suffer from the concuss hereaft  the admir wound it up summarili by exclaim   ay  a veri bad busi inde  a new sort of way this  for a young fellow to be make love  by break his mistress  s head  is not it  miss elliot  this is break a head and give a plaster  truli  admir croft  s manner were not quit of the tone to suit ladi russel  but they delight ann  his good of heart and simplic of charact were irresist   now  this must be veri bad for you  said he  sudden rous from a littl reveri   to be come and find us here  i had not recollect it befor  i declar  but it must be veri bad  but now  do not stand upon ceremoni  get up and go over all the room in the hous if you like it   anoth time  sir  i thank you  not now   well  whenev it suit you  you can slip in from the shrubberi at ani time  and there you will find we keep our umbrella hang up by that

anoth  s  but we all like our own best  and so you must judg for yourself  whether it would be better for you to go about the hous or not  ann  find she might declin it  did so  veri grate   we have made veri few chang either  continu the admir  after think a moment   veri few  we told you about the laundri  door  at uppercross  that has been a veri great improv  the wonder was  how ani famili upon earth could bear with the inconveni of it open as it did  so long  you will tell sir walter what we have done  and that mr shepherd think it the greatest improv the hous ever had  inde  i must do ourselv the justic to say  that the few alter we have made have been all veri much for the better  my wife should have the credit of them  howev  i have done veri littl besid send away some of the larg look  glass from my dress  room  which was your father  s  a veri good man  and veri much the gentleman i am sure  but i should think  miss elliot   look with serious reflect   i should think he must be rather a dressi man for his time of life  such a number of look  glass  oh lord  there was no get away from one  s self  so i got sophi to lend me a hand  and we soon shift their quarter  and now i am quit snug  with my littl shave glass in one corner  and anoth great thing that i never go near  ann  amus in spite of herself  was rather distress for an answer  and the admir  fear he might not have been civil enough  took up the subject again  to say   the next time you write to your good father  miss elliot  pray give him my compliment and mrs croft  s  and say that we are settl here quit to our like  and have no fault at all to find with the place  the breakfast  room chimney smoke a littl  i grant you  but it is onli when the wind is due north and blow hard  which may not happen three time a winter  and take it altogeth  now that we have been into most of the hous hereabout and can judg  there is not one that we like better than this  pray say so  with my compliment  he will be glad to hear it  ladi russel and mrs croft were veri well pleas with each other  but the acquaint which this visit began was fate not to proceed far at present  for when it was return  the croft announc themselv to be go away for a few week  to visit their connexion in the north of the counti  and probabl might not be at home again befor ladi russel would be remov to bath  so end all danger to ann of meet captain wentworth at kellynch hall  or of see him in compani with her friend  everyth was safe enough  and she smile over the mani anxious feel she had wast on the subject  chapter 14 though charl and mari had remain at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgrov  s go than ann conceiv they could have been at all want  they were yet the first of the famili to be at home again  and as

extrem of tender  and though she might be pronounc to be altogeth do veri well  it was still imposs to say when she might be abl to bear the remov home  and her father and mother  who must return in

as much as she could  everi possibl suppli from uppercross had been furnish  to lighten the inconveni to the harvill  while the harvill had been want them to come to dinner everi day  and in short  it seem to have been onli a struggl on each side as to which should be most disinterest and hospit  mari had had her evil  but upon the whole  as was evid by her stay so long  she had found more to enjoy than to suffer  charl hayter had been at lyme often than suit her  and when they dine with the harvill there had been onli a maid  servant to wait  and at first mrs harvill had alway given mrs musgrov

the harvill  and she had got book from the librari  and chang them so often  that the balanc had certain been much in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth too  and she had bath  and she had gone to church  and there were a great mani more peopl to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross  and all this  join to the sens of be so veri use  had made realli an agreeabl fortnight  ann enquir after captain benwick  mari  s face was cloud direct  charl laugh   oh  captain benwick is veri well  i believ  but he is a veri odd young man  i do not know what he would be at  we ask him to

captain benwick entitl by birth and situat to be in love with an elliot  or from not want to believ ann a greater attract to uppercross than herself  must be left to be guess  ann  s good  will  howev

with him  but  as charl maintain to the last  captain benwick seem much more dispos to ride over to kellynch  there can be no doubt that ladi russel and ann were both occasion think of captain benwick  from this time  ladi russel could not hear the door  bell without feel that it might be his herald  nor could ann return from ani stroll of solitari indulg in her father  s ground  or ani visit of

such solicitud to be receiv as a relat again  that their former good understand was complet re  establish  they had not a fault to find in him  he had explain away all the appear of neglect on his own

but well educ  accomplish  rich  and excess in love with his friend  there had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attract  not all her money would have tempt elliot  and sir walter was  moreov  assur of her have been a veri fine woman  here was a great deal to soften the busi  a veri fine woman with a larg fortun  in love with him  sir walter seem to admit it as complet apolog  and though elizabeth could not see the circumst in quit so favour a light  she allow it be a great extenu  mr elliot had call repeat  had dine with them onc  evid delight by the distinct of be ask  for

had noth to gain by be on term with sir walter  noth to risk by a state of varianc  in all probabl he was alreadi the richer of the two  and the kellynch estat would as sure be his hereaft as the titl

ann could not have suppos it possibl that her first even in camden place could have pass so well  chapter 16 there was one point which ann  on return to her famili  would have been more thank to ascertain even than mr elliot  s be in love with elizabeth  which was  her father  s not be in love with mrs clay  and she was veri far from easi about it  when she had been at home a few hour  on go down to breakfast the next morn  she found there had just been a decent pretenc on the ladi  s side of mean to leav them  she could imagin mrs clay to have said  that  now miss ann was come  she could not suppos herself at all want  for elizabeth was repli in a sort of whisper   that must not be ani reason  inde  i assur you i feel it none  she is noth to me  compar with you  and she was in full

certain you cannot do better than to continu as you are  you cannot be better than well  or i should recommend gowland  the constant use of gowland  dure the spring month  mrs clay has been use it at my recommend  and you see what it has done for her  you see how it has carri away her freckl  if elizabeth could but have heard this  such person prais might have struck her  especi as it did not appear to ann that the freckl were at all lessen  but everyth must take it chanc  the evil of a marriag would be much diminish  if elizabeth were also to marri  as for herself  she might alway command a home with ladi russel  ladi russel  s compos mind and polit manner were put to some trial on this point  in her intercours in camden place  the sight of mrs clay in such favour  and of ann so

she was sure that he had not been happi in marriag  colonel walli said it  and ladi russel saw it  but it had been no unhappi to sour his mind  nor  she began pretti soon to suspect  to prevent his think of a second choic  her satisfact in mr elliot outweigh all the plagu of mrs clay  it was now some year sinc ann had begun to learn that she and her excel friend could sometim think differ  and it did not surpris her  therefor  that ladi russel should see noth suspici or inconsist  noth to requir more motiv than appear  in mr elliot  s great desir of a reconcili  in ladi russel  s view  it was perfect natur that mr elliot  at a matur time of life  should feel it a most desir object  and what would veri general recommend him among all sensibl peopl  to be on good term with the head of

russel listen  and look  and made onli this cautious repli  elizabeth  veri well  time will explain  it was a refer to the futur  which ann  after a littl observ  felt she must submit to  she could determin noth at present  in that hous elizabeth must be first  and she was in the habit of such general observ as  miss elliot  that ani particular of attent seem almost imposs  mr elliot  too  it must be rememb  had not been a widow seven month  a littl delay on his side might be veri excus  in fact  ann could never see the crape round his hat  without fear that she was the inexcus one  in attribut to him such imagin  for though his marriag had not been veri happi  still it had exist so mani year that she could not comprehend a veri rapid recoveri from the aw impress of it be dissolv  howev it might end  he was without ani question their pleasantest acquaint in bath  she saw nobodi equal to him  and it was a great indulg now and then to talk to him about lyme  which he seem to have as live a wish to see again  and to see more of  as herself  they went through the particular of their first meet a great mani time  he gave her to understand that he had look at her with some earnest  she knew it well  and she rememb anoth person  s look also  they did not alway think alik  his valu for rank and connexion she perceiv was greater than her  it was not mere complais  it must be a like to the caus  which made him enter warm into her father and sister  s solicitud on a subject which she thought unworthi to excit them  the bath paper one morn announc the arriv of the dowag viscountess dalrympl  and her daughter  the honour miss carteret  and all the comfort of no  camden place  was swept away for mani day  for the dalrympl  in ann  s opinion  most unfortun  were cousin of the elliot  and the agoni was how to introduc themselv proper  ann had never seen her father and sister befor in contact with nobil  and she must acknowledg herself disappoint  she had hope better

our cousin  the dalrympl  sound in her ear all day long  sir walter had onc been in compani with the late viscount  but had never seen ani of the rest of the famili  and the difficulti of the case aros from there have been a suspens of all intercours by letter of ceremoni  ever sinc the death of that said late viscount  when  in consequ of a danger ill of sir walter  s at the same time  there had been an unlucki omiss at kellynch  no letter of condol had been sent to ireland  the neglect had been visit on the head of the sinner  for when poor ladi elliot die herself  no letter of condol was receiv at kellynch  and  consequ  there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrympl consid the relationship as close  how to have this anxious busi set to right  and be admit as cousin again  was the question  and it was a question which  in a more ration manner  neither ladi russel nor mr elliot thought unimport   famili connexion were alway worth preserv  good compani alway worth seek  ladi dalrympl had taken a hous  for three month  in laura place  and would be live in style  she had been at bath the year befor  and ladi russel had heard her spoken of as a charm woman  it was veri desir that the connexion should be renew  if it could be done  without ani compromis of proprieti on the side of the elliot  sir walter  howev  would choos his own mean  and at last wrote a veri fine letter of ampl explan  regret  and entreati  to his right honour cousin  neither ladi russel nor mr elliot could admir the letter  but it did all that was want  in bring three line of scrawl from

miss hamilton  three year older than herself  but still from the want of near relat and a settl home  remain anoth year at school  had been use and good to her in a way which had consider lessen her miseri  and could never be rememb with indiffer  miss hamilton had left school  had marri not long afterward  was said to have marri a man of fortun  and this was all that ann had known of her  till now that their gover  s account brought her situat forward in a more decid but veri differ form  she was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravag  and at his death  about two year befor  had left his affair dread involv  she had had difficulti of everi sort to contend with  and in addit to these distress had been afflict with a sever rheumat fever  which  final settl in her leg  had made her for the present a crippl  she had come to bath on that account  and was now in lodg near the hot bath  live in a veri humbl way  unabl even to afford herself the comfort of a servant  and of cours almost exclud from societi  their mutual friend answer for the satisfact which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith  and ann therefor lost no time in go  she mention noth of what she had heard  or what she intend  at home  it would excit no proper interest there  she onli consult ladi russel  who enter thorough into her sentiment  and was most happi to convey her as near to mrs smith  s lodg in westgat build  as ann chose to be taken  the visit was paid  their acquaint re  establish  their interest in each other more than re  kindl  the first ten minut had it awkward and it emot  twelv year were gone sinc they had part  and each present a somewhat differ person from what the other had imagin  twelv year had chang ann from the bloom  silent  unform girl of fifteen  to the eleg

in all the glow of health and confid of superior  into a poor  infirm  helpless widow  receiv the visit of her former protege as a favour  but all that was uncomfort in the meet had soon pass away  and left onli the interest charm of rememb former partial and talk over old time  ann found in mrs smith the good sens and agreeabl manner which she had almost ventur to depend on  and a disposit to convers and be cheer beyond her expect  neither the dissip of the past  and she had live veri much in the world  nor the restrict of the present  neither sick nor sorrow seem to have close her heart or ruin her spirit  in the cours of a second visit she talk with great open  and ann  s astonish increas  she could scarc imagin a more cheerless situat in itself than mrs smith  s  she had been veri fond of her husband  she had buri him  she had been use to affluenc  it was gone  she had no child to connect her with life and happi again  no relat to assist in the arrang of perplex affair  no health to make all the rest support  her accommod were limit to a noisi parlour  and a dark bedroom behind  with no possibl of move from one to the other without assist  which there was onli one servant in the hous to afford  and she never quit the hous but to be convey into the warm bath  yet  in spite of all this  ann had reason to believ that she had moment onli of languor and depress  to hour of occup and enjoy  how could it be  she watch  observ  reflect  and final determin that this was not a case of fortitud or of resign onli  a submiss spirit might be patient  a strong understand would suppli resolut  but here was someth more  here was that elast of mind  that disposit to be comfort  that power of turn readili from evil to good  and of find employ which carri her out of herself  which was from natur alon  it was the choicest gift of heaven  and ann view her friend as one of those instanc in which  by a merci appoint  it seem design to counterbal almost everi other want  there had been a time  mrs smith told her  when her spirit had near fail  she could not call herself an invalid now  compar with her state on first reach bath  then she had  inde  been a pitiabl object  for she had caught cold on the journey  and had hard taken possess of her lodg befor she was again confin to her bed and suffer under sever and constant pain  and all this among stranger  with

the worth of volum   yes  said mrs smith more doubt   sometim it may  though i fear it lesson are not often in the elev style you describ  here and there  human natur may be great in time of trial  but general speak  it is it weak and not it strength that appear in a sick chamber  it is selfish and impati rather than generos and fortitud  that one hear of  there is so littl real friendship in the world  and unfortun   speak low and tremul   there are so mani who forget to think serious till it is almost too late  ann saw the miseri of such feel  the husband had not been what he ought  and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think wors of the world than she hope it deserv  it was but a pass emot howev with mrs smith  she shook it off  and soon ad in a differ

to blame in it  repli ann   on the contrari  she approv it  and has general taken me when i have call on mrs smith   westgat build must have been rather surpris by the appear of a carriag drawn up near it pavement  observ sir walter   sir henri russel  s widow  inde  has no honour to distinguish her arm  but still it is a handsom equipag  and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot  a

friend of miss ann elliot  and to be prefer by her to her own famili connect among the nobil of england and ireland  mrs smith  such a name  mrs clay  who had been present while all this pass  now thought it advis to leav the room  and ann could have said much  and did long to say a littl in defenc of her friend  s not veri dissimilar claim to their  but her sens of person respect to her father prevent her  she made no repli  she left it to himself to recollect  that mrs smith was not the onli widow in bath between thirti and forti  with littl to live on  and no surnam of digniti  ann kept her appoint  the other kept their  and of cours she heard the next morn that they had had a delight even  she had been the onli one of the set absent  for sir walter and elizabeth had not onli been quit at her ladyship  s servic themselv  but had actual been happi to be employ by her in collect other  and had been at the troubl of invit both ladi russel and mr elliot  and mr elliot had made a point of leav colonel walli earli  and ladi russel had fresh arrang all her even engag in order to wait on her  ann had the whole histori of all that such an even could suppli from ladi russel  to her  it greatest interest must be  in have been veri much talk of between her friend and mr elliot  in have been wish for  regret  and at the same time honour for stay away in such a caus  her kind  compassion visit to this old schoolfellow  sick and reduc  seem to have quit delight mr elliot  he thought her a most extraordinari young woman  in her temper  manner  mind  a model of femal excel  he could meet even ladi russel in a discuss of her merit  and ann could not be given to understand so much by her friend  could not know herself to be so high rate by a sensibl man  without mani of those agreeabl sensat which her friend meant to creat  ladi russel was now perfect decid in her opinion of mr elliot  she was as much convinc of his mean to gain ann in time as of his deserv her  and was begin to calcul the number of week which would free him from all the remain restraint of widowhood  and leav him at liberti to exert his most open power of pleas  she would not speak to ann with half the certainti she felt on the subject  she would ventur on littl more than hint of what might be hereaft  of a possibl attach on his side  of the desir of the allianc  suppos such attach to be real and return  ann heard her  and made no violent exclam  she onli smile  blush  and gentl shook her head   i am no match  maker  as you well know  said ladi russel   be much too well awar of the uncertainti of all human event and calcul  i onli mean that if mr elliot should some time henc pay his address to you  and if you should be dispos to accept him  i think there would be everi possibl of your be happi togeth  a most suitabl connect everybodi must consid it  but i think it might be a veri happi one   mr elliot is an exceed agreeabl man  and in mani respect i think high of him  said ann   but we should not suit  ladi russel let this pass  and onli said in rejoind   i own that to be abl to regard you as the futur mistress of kellynch  the futur ladi elliot  to look forward and see you occupi your dear mother  s place  succeed to all her right  and all her popular  as well as to all her virtu  would be the highest possibl gratif to me  you are your mother  s self in counten and disposit  and if i might be allow to fanci you such as she was  in situat and name  and home  presid and bless in the same spot  and onli superior to her in be more high valu  my dearest ann  it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life  ann was oblig to turn away  to rise  to walk to a distant tabl  and  lean there in pretend employ  tri to subdu the feel this pictur excit  for a few moment her imagin and her heart were bewitch  the idea of becom what her mother had been  of have the precious name of  ladi elliot  first reviv in herself  of be restor to kellynch  call it her home again  her home for ever  was a charm which she could not immedi resist  ladi russel said not anoth word  will to leav the matter to it own oper  and believ that  could mr elliot at that moment with proprieti have spoken for himself  she believ  in short  what ann did not believ  the same imag of mr elliot speak for himself brought ann to composur again  the charm of kellynch and of  ladi elliot  all fade away  she never could accept him  and it was not onli that her feel were still advers to ani man save one  her judgement  on a serious consider of the possibl of such a case was against mr elliot  though they had now been acquaint a month  she could not be satisfi that she realli knew his charact  that he was a sensibl man  an agreeabl man  that he talk well  profess good opinion  seem to judg proper and as a man of principl  this was all clear enough  he certain knew what was right  nor could she fix on ani one articl of moral duti evid transgress  but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrust the past  if not the present  the name which occasion dropt of former associ  the allus to former practic and pursuit  suggest suspicion not favour of what he had been  she saw that there had been bad habit  that sunday travel had been a common thing  that there had been a period of his life  and probabl not a short one  when he had been  at least  careless in all serious matter  and  though he might now think veri differ  who could answer for the true sentiment of a clever  cautious man  grown old enough to appreci a fair charact  how could it ever be ascertain that his mind was truli cleans  mr elliot was ration  discreet  polish  but he was not open  there was never ani burst of feel  ani warmth of indign or delight  at the evil or good of other  this  to ann  was a decid imperfect  her earli impress were incur  she prize the frank  the open  heart  the eager charact beyond all other  warmth and enthusiasm did captiv her still  she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincer of those who sometim look or said a careless or a hasti thing  than of those whose presenc of mind never vari  whose tongu never slip  mr elliot was too general agreeabl  various as were the temper in her father  s hous  he pleas them all  he endur too well  stood too well with everi bodi  he had spoken to her with some degre of open of mrs clay  had appear complet to see what mrs clay was about  and to hold her in contempt  and yet mrs clay found him as agreeabl as ani bodi  ladi russel saw either less or more than her young friend  for she saw noth to excit distrust  she could not imagin a man more exact what he ought to be than mr elliot  nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feel than the hope of see him receiv the hand of her belov ann in kellynch church  in the cours of the follow autumn  chapter 18 it was the begin of februari  and ann  have been a month in bath  was grow veri eager for news from uppercross and lyme

will astonish you not a littl  she and the harvill came on tuesday veri safe  and in the even we went to ask her how she did  when we were rather surpris not to find captain benwick of the parti  for he had been invit as well as the harvill  and what do you think was the reason  neither more nor less than his be in love with louisa  and not choos to ventur to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrov  for it was all settl between him and her befor she came away  and he had written to her father by captain harvill  true  upon my honour  are not you astonish  i shall be surpris at least if you ever receiv a hint of it  for i never did  mrs musgrov protest solemn that she knew noth of the matter  we are all veri well pleas  howev  for though it is not equal to her marri captain wentworth  it is infinit better than charl hayter  and mr musgrov has written his consent  and captain benwick is expect to  day  mrs harvill say her husband feel a good deal on his poor sister  s account  but  howev  louisa is a great favourit with both  inde  mrs harvill and i quit agre that we love her the better for have nurs her  charl wonder what captain wentworth will say  but if you rememb  i never thought him attach to louisa  i never could see anyth of it  and this is the end  you see  of captain benwick  s be suppos to be an admir of your  how charl could take such a thing into his head was alway incomprehens to me  i hope he will be more agreeabl now  certain not a great match for louisa musgrov  but a million time better than marri among the hayter  mari need not have fear her sister  s be in ani degre prepar for the news  she had never in her life been more astonish  captain benwick and louisa musgrov  it was almost too wonder for belief  and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room  preserv an air of calm  and answer the common question of the moment  happili for her  they were not mani  sir walter want to know whether the croft travel with four hors  and whether they were like to be situat in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in  but had littl curios beyond   how is mari  said elizabeth  and without wait for an answer   and pray what bring the croft to bath   they come on the admir  s account  he is thought to be gouti   gout and decrepitud  said sir walter   poor old gentleman   have they ani acquaint here  ask elizabeth   i do not know  but i can hard suppos that  at admir croft  s time of life  and in his profess  he should not have mani acquaint in such a place as this   i suspect  said sir walter coolli   that admir croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall  elizabeth  may we ventur to present him and his wife in laura place   oh  no  i think not  situat as we are with ladi dalrympl  cousin  we ought to be veri care not to embarrass her with acquaint she might not approv  if we were not relat  it would not signifi  but as cousin  she would feel scrupul as to ani propos of our  we had better leav the croft to find their own level  there are sever odd  look men walk about here  who  i am told  are sailor  the croft will associ with them  this was sir walter and elizabeth  s share of interest in the letter  when mrs clay had paid her tribut of more decent attent  in an enquiri after mrs charl musgrov  and her fine littl boy  ann was at liberti  in her own room  she tri to comprehend it  well might charl wonder how captain wentworth would feel  perhap he had quit the field  had given louisa up  had ceas to love  had found he did not love her  she could not endur the idea of treacheri or leviti  or anyth akin to ill usag between him and his friend  she could not endur that such a friendship as their should be sever unfair  captain benwick and louisa musgrov  the high  spirit  joyous  talk louisa musgrov  and the deject  think  feel  read  captain benwick  seem each of them everyth that would not suit the other  their mind most dissimilar  where could have been the attract  the answer soon present itself  it had been in situat  they had been thrown togeth sever week  they had been live in the same small famili parti  sinc henrietta  s come away  they must have been depend almost entir on each other  and louisa  just recov from ill  had been in an interest state  and captain benwick was not inconsol  that was a point which ann had not been abl to avoid suspect befor  and instead of draw the same conclus as mari  from the present cours of event  they serv onli to confirm the idea of his have felt some dawn of tender toward herself  she did not mean  howev  to deriv much more from it to gratifi her vaniti  than mari might have allow  she was persuad that ani toler pleas young woman who had listen and seem to feel for him would have receiv the same compliment  he had an affection heart  he must love somebodi  she saw no reason against their be happi  louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with  and they would soon grow more alik  he would gain cheer  and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron  nay  that was probabl learnt alreadi  of cours they had fallen in love over poetri  the idea of louisa musgrov turn into a person of literari tast  and sentiment reflect was amus  but she had no doubt of it be so  the day at lyme  the fall from the cobb  might influenc her health  her nerv  her courag  her charact to the end of her life  as thorough as it appear to have influenc her fate  the conclus of the whole was  that if the woman who had been sensibl of captain wentworth  s merit could be allow to prefer anoth man  there was noth in the engag to excit last wonder  and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it  certain noth to be regret  no  it was not regret which made ann  s heart beat in spite of herself  and brought the colour into her cheek when she thought of captain wentworth unshackl and free  she had some feel which she was asham to investig  they were too much like joy  senseless joy  she long to see the croft  but when the meet took place  it was evid that no rumour of the news had yet reach them  the visit of ceremoni was paid and return  and louisa musgrov was mention  and captain benwick  too  without even half a smile  the croft had place themselv in lodg in gay street  perfect to sir walter  s satisfact  he was not at all asham of the acquaint  and did  in fact  think and talk a great deal more about the admir  than the admir ever thought or talk about him  the croft knew quit as mani peopl in bath as they wish for  and consid their intercours with the elliot as a mere matter of form  and not in the least like to afford them ani pleasur  they brought with them their countri habit of be almost alway togeth  he was order to walk to keep off the gout  and mrs croft seem to go share with him in everyth  and to walk for her life to do him good  ann saw them wherev she went  ladi russel took her out in her carriag almost everi morn  and she never fail to think of them  and never fail to see them  know their feel as she did  it was a most attract pictur of happi to her  she alway watch them as long as she could  delight to fanci she understood what they might be talk of  as they walk along in happi independ  or equal delight to see the admir  s hearti shake of the hand when he encount an old friend  and observ their eager of convers when occasion form into a littl knot of the navi  mrs croft look as intellig and keen as ani of the offic around her  ann was too much engag with ladi russel to be often walk herself  but it so happen that one morn  about a week or ten day after the croft  s arriv  it suit her best to leav her friend  or her friend  s carriag  in the lower part of the town  and return alon to camden place  and in walk up milsom street she had the good fortun to meet with the admir  he was stand by himself at a printshop window  with his hand behind him  in earnest contempl of some print  and she not onli might have pass him unseen  but was oblig to touch as well as address him befor she could catch his notic  when he did perceiv and acknowledg her  howev  it was done with all his usual frank and good humour   ha  is it you  thank you  thank you  this is treat me like a friend  here i am  you see  stare at a pictur  i can never get by this shop without stop  but what a thing here is  by way of a boat  do look at it  did you ever see the like  what queer fellow your fine painter must be  to think that anybodi would ventur their live in such a shapeless old cockleshel as that  and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightili at their eas  and look about them at the rock and mountain  as if they were not to be upset the next moment  which they certain must be  i wonder where that boat was built   laugh heartili   i would not ventur over a horsepond in it  well   turn away   now  where are you bound  can i go anywher for you  or with you  can i be of ani use

snug walk togeth  and i have someth to tell you as we go along  there  take my arm  that  s right  i do not feel comfort if i have not a woman there  lord  what a boat it is  take a last look at the pictur  as they began to be in motion   did you say that you had someth to tell me  sir   yes  i have  present  but here come a friend  captain brigden  i shall onli say   how d  ye do  as we pass  howev  i shall not stop   how d  ye do  brigden stare to see anybodi with me but my wife  she  poor soul  is tie by the leg  she has a blister on one of her heel  as larg as a three  shill piec  if you look across the street  you will see admir brand come down and his brother  shabbi fellow  both of them  i am glad they are not on this side of the way  sophi cannot bear them  they play me a piti trick onc  got away with some of my best men  i will tell you the whole stori anoth time  there come old sir archibald drew and his grandson  look  he see us  he kiss his hand to you  he take you for my wife  ah  the peac has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald  how do you like bath  miss elliot  it suit us veri well  we are alway meet with some old friend or other  the street full of them everi morn  sure to have plenti of chat  and then we get away from them all  and shut ourselv in our lodg  and draw in our chair  and are snug as if we were at kellynch  ay  or as we use to be even at north yarmouth and deal  we do not like our lodg here the wors  i can tell you  for put us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth  the wind blow through one of the cupboard just in the same way  when they were got a littl farther  ann ventur to press again for what he had to communic  she hope when clear of milsom street to have her curios gratifi  but she was still oblig to wait  for the admir had made up his mind not to begin till they had gain the greater space and quiet of belmont  and as she was not realli mrs croft  she must let him have his own way  as soon as they were fair ascend belmont  he began   well  now you shall hear someth that will surpris you  but first of all  you must tell me the name of the young ladi i am go to talk about  that young ladi  you know  that we have all been so concern for  the miss musgrov  that all this has been happen to  her christian name  i alway forget her christian name  ann had been asham to appear to comprehend so soon as she realli did  but now she could safe suggest the name of  louisa   ay  ay  miss louisa musgrov  that is the name  i wish young ladi had not such a number of fine christian name  i should never be out if they were all sophi  or someth of that sort  well  this miss louisa  we all thought  you know  was to marri frederick  he was court her week after week  the onli wonder was  what they could be wait for  till the busi at lyme came  then  inde  it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right  but even then there was someth odd in their way of go on  instead of stay at lyme  he went off to plymouth  and then he went off to see edward  when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward  s  and there he has been ever sinc  we have seen noth of him sinc novemb  even sophi could not understand it  but now  the matter has take the strangest turn of all  for this young ladi  the same miss musgrov  instead of be to marri frederick  is to marri jame benwick  you know jame benwick   a littl  i am a littl acquaint with captain benwick   well  she is to marri him  nay  most like they are marri alreadi  for i do not know what they should wait for   i thought captain benwick a veri pleas young man  said ann   and i understand that he bear an excel charact   oh  yes  yes  there is not a word to be said against jame benwick  he is onli a command  it is true  made last summer  and these are bad time for get on  but he has not anoth fault that i know of  an excel  good  heart fellow  i assur you  a veri activ  zealous offic too  which is more than you would think for  perhap  for that soft sort of manner doe not do him justic   inde you are mistaken there  sir  i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick  s manner  i thought them particular pleas  and i will answer for it  they would general pleas   well  well  ladi are the best judg  but jame benwick is rather too piano for me  and though veri like it is all our partial  sophi and i cannot help think frederick  s manner better than his  there is someth about frederick more to our tast  ann was caught  she had onli meant to oppos the too common idea of spirit and gentl be incompat with each other  not at all to repres captain benwick  s manner as the veri best that could possibl be  and  after a littl hesit  she was begin to say   i was not enter into ani comparison of the two friend  but the admir interrupt her with   and the thing is certain true  it is not a mere bit of gossip  we have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letter from him yesterday  in which he tell us of it  and he had just had it in a letter from harvill  written upon the spot  from uppercross  i fanci they are all at uppercross  this was an opportun which ann could not resist  she said  therefor   i hope  admir  i hope there is noth in the style of captain wentworth  s letter to make you and mrs croft particular uneasi  it did seem  last autumn  as if there were an attach between him and louisa musgrov  but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equal  and without violenc  i hope his letter doe not breath the spirit of an ill  use man   not at all  not at all  there is not an oath or a murmur from begin to end  ann look down to hide her smile   no  no  frederick is not a man to whine and complain  he has too much spirit for that  if the girl like anoth man better  it is veri fit she should have him   certain  but what i mean is  that i hope there is noth in captain wentworth  s manner of write to make you suppos he think himself ill  use by his friend  which might appear  you know  without it be absolut said  i should be veri sorri that such a friendship as has subsist between him and captain benwick should be destroy  or even wound  by a circumst of this sort   yes  yes  i understand you  but there is noth at all of that natur in the letter  he doe not give the least fling at benwick  doe not so much as say   i wonder at it  i have a reason of my own for wonder at it  no  you would not guess  from his way of write  that he had ever thought of this miss  what  s her name  for himself  he veri handsom hope they will be happi togeth  and there is noth veri unforgiv in that  i think  ann did not receiv the perfect convict which the admir meant to convey  but it would have been useless to press the enquiri farther  she therefor satisfi herself with common  place remark or quiet attent  and the admir had it all his own way   poor frederick  said he at last   now he must begin all over again with somebodi els  i think we must get him to bath  sophi must write  and beg him to come to bath  here are pretti girl enough  i am sure  it would be of no use to go to uppercross again  for that other miss musgrov  i find  is bespok by her cousin  the young parson  do not you think  miss elliot  we had better tri to get him to bath  chapter 19 while admir croft was take this walk with ann  and express his wish of get captain wentworth to bath  captain wentworth was alreadi on his way thither  befor mrs croft had written  he was arriv  and the veri next time ann walk out  she saw him  mr elliot was attend his two cousin and mrs clay  they were in milsom street  it began to rain  not much  but enough to make shelter desir for women  and quit enough to make it veri desir for miss elliot to have the advantag of be convey home in ladi dalrympl  s carriag  which was seen wait at a littl distanc  she  ann  and mrs clay  therefor  turn into molland  s  while mr elliot step to ladi dalrympl  to request her assist  he soon join them again  success  of cours  ladi dalrympl would be most happi to take them home  and would call for them in a few minut  her ladyship  s carriag was a barouch  and did not hold more than four with ani comfort  miss carteret was with her mother  consequ it was not reason to expect accommod for all the three camden place ladi  there could be no doubt as to miss elliot  whoever suffer inconveni  she must suffer none  but it occupi a littl time to settl the point of civil between the other two  the rain was a mere trifl  and ann was most sincer in prefer a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was also a mere trifl to mrs clay  she would hard allow it even to drop at all  and her boot were so thick  much thicker than miss ann  s  and  in short  her civil render her quit as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as ann could be  and it was discuss between them with a generos so polit and so determin  that the other were oblig to settl it for them  miss elliot maintain that mrs clay had a littl cold alreadi  and mr elliot decid on appeal  that his cousin ann  s boot were rather the thickest  it was fix accord  that mrs clay should be of the parti in the carriag  and they had just reach this point  when ann  as she sat near the window  descri  most decid and distinct  captain wentworth walk down the street  her start was percept onli to herself  but she instant felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world  the most unaccount and absurd  for a few minut she saw noth befor her  it was all confus  she was lost  and when she had scold back her sens  she found the other still wait for the carriag  and mr elliot  alway oblig  just set off for union street on a commiss of mrs clay  s  she now felt a great inclin to go to the outer door  she want to see if it rain  whi was she to suspect herself of anoth motiv  captain wentworth must be out of sight  she left her seat  she would go  one half of her should not be alway so much wiser than the other half  or alway suspect the other of be wors than it was  she would see if it rain  she was sent back  howev  in a moment by the entranc of captain wentworth himself  among a parti of gentlemen and ladi  evid his acquaint  and whom he must have join a littl below milsom street  he was more obvious struck and confus by the sight of her than she had ever observ befor  he look quit red  for the first time  sinc their renew acquaint  she felt that she was betray the least sensibl of the two  she had the advantag of him in the prepar of the last few moment  all the overpow  blind  bewild  first effect of strong surpris were over with her  still  howev  she had enough to feel  it was agit  pain  pleasur  a someth between delight and miseri  he spoke to her  and then turn away  the charact of his manner was embarrass  she could not have call it either cold or friend  or anyth so certain as embarrass  after a short interv  howev  he came toward her  and spoke again  mutual enquiri on common subject pass  neither of them  probabl  much the wiser for what they heard  and ann continu fulli sensibl of his be less at eas than former  they had by dint of be so veri much togeth  got to speak to each other with a consider portion of appar indiffer and calm  but he could not do it now  time had chang him  or louisa had chang him  there was conscious of some sort or other  he look veri well  not as if he had been suffer in health or spirit  and he talk of uppercross  of the musgrov  nay  even of louisa  and had even a momentari look of his own arch signific as he name her  but yet it was captain wentworth not comfort  not easi  not abl to feign that he was  it did not surpris  but it griev ann to observ that elizabeth would not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth  that elizabeth saw him  that there was complet intern recognit on each side  she was convinc that he was readi to be acknowledg as an acquaint  expect it  and she had the pain of see her sister turn away with unalter cold  ladi dalrympl  s carriag  for which miss elliot was grow veri impati  now drew up  the servant came in to announc it  it was begin to rain again  and altogeth there was a delay  and a bustl  and a talk  which must make all the littl crowd in the shop understand that ladi dalrympl was call to convey miss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend  unattend but by the servant   for there was no cousin return  were walk off  and captain wentworth  watch them  turn again to ann  and by manner  rather than word  was offer his servic to her   i am much oblig to you  was her answer   but i am not go with them  the carriag would not accommod so mani  i walk  i prefer walk   but it rain   oh  veri littl  noth that i regard  after a moment  s paus he said   though i came onli yesterday  i have equip myself proper for bath alreadi  you see   point to a new umbrella   i wish you would make use of it  if you are determin to walk  though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair  she was veri much oblig to him  but declin it all  repeat her convict  that the rain would come to noth at present  and ad   i am onli wait for mr elliot  he will be here in a moment  i am sure  she had hard spoken the word when mr elliot walk in  captain wentworth recollect him perfect  there was no differ between him and the man who had stood on the step at lyme  admir ann as she pass  except in the air and look and manner of the privileg relat and friend  he came in with eager  appear to see and think onli of her  apologis for his stay  was griev to have kept her wait  and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and befor the rain increas  and in anoth moment they walk off togeth  her arm under his  a gentl and embarrass glanc  and a  good morn to you  be all that she had time for  as she pass away  as soon as they were out of sight  the ladi of captain wentworth  s parti began talk of them   mr elliot doe not dislik his cousin  i fanci   oh  no  that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen there  he is alway with them  half live in the famili  i believ  what a veri good  look man   yes  and miss atkinson  who dine with him onc at the wallis  say he is the most agreeabl man she ever was in compani with   she is pretti  i think  ann elliot  veri pretti  when one come to look at her  it is not the fashion to say so  but i confess i admir her more than her sister   oh  so do i   and so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliot  ann is too delic for them  ann would have been particular oblig to her cousin  if he would have walk by her side all the way to camden place  without say a word  she had never found it so difficult to listen to him  though noth could exceed his solicitud and care  and though his subject were princip such as were wont to be alway interest  prais  warm  just  and discrimin  of ladi russel  and insinu high ration against mrs clay  but just now she could think onli of captain wentworth  she could not understand his present feel  whether he were realli suffer much from disappoint or not  and till that point were settl  she could not be quit herself  she hope to be wise and reason in time  but ala  ala  she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet  anoth circumst veri essenti for her to know  was how long he meant to be in bath  he had not mention it  or she could not recollect it  he might be onli pass through  but it was more probabl that he should be come to stay  in that case  so liabl as everi bodi was to meet everi bodi in bath  ladi russel would in all likelihood see him somewher  would she recollect him  how would it all be  she had alreadi been oblig to tell ladi russel that louisa musgrov was to marri captain benwick  it had cost her someth to encount ladi russel  s surpris  and now  if she were by ani chanc to be thrown into compani with captain wentworth  her imperfect knowledg of the matter might add anoth shade of prejudic against him  the follow morn ann was out with her friend  and for the first hour  in an incess and fear sort of watch for him in vain  but at last  in return down pulteney street  she distinguish him on the right hand pavement at such a distanc as to have him in view the greater part of the street  there were mani other men about him  mani group walk the same way  but there was no mistak him  she look instinct at ladi russel  but not from ani mad idea of her recognis him so soon as she did herself  no  it was not to be suppos that ladi russel would perceiv him till they were near opposit  she look at her howev  from time to time  anxious  and when the moment approach which must point him out  though not dare to look again  for her own counten she knew was unfit to be seen  she was yet perfect conscious of ladi russel  s eye be turn exact in the direct for him  of her be  in short  intent observ him  she could thorough comprehend the sort of fascin he must possess over ladi russel  s mind  the difficulti it must be for her to withdraw her eye  the astonish she must be feel that eight or nine year should have pass over him  and in foreign clime and in activ servic too  without rob him of one person grace  at last  ladi russel drew back her head   now  how would she speak of him   you will wonder  said she   what has been fix my eye so long  but i was look after some window  curtain  which ladi alicia and mrs frankland were tell me of last night  they describ the draw  room window  curtain of one of the hous on this side of the way  and this part of the street  as be the handsomest and best hung of ani in bath  but could not recollect the exact number  and i have been tri to find out which it could be  but i confess i can see no curtain hereabout that answer their descript  ann sigh and blush and smile  in piti and disdain  either at her friend or herself  the part which provok her most  was that in all this wast of foresight and caution  she should have lost the right moment for see whether he saw them  a day or two pass without produc anyth  the theatr or the room  where he was most like to be  were not fashion enough for the elliot  whose even amus were sole in the eleg stupid of privat parti  in which they were get more and more engag  and ann  weari of such a state of stagnat  sick of know noth  and fanci herself stronger becaus her strength was not tri  was quit impati for the concert even  it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronis by ladi dalrympl  of cours they must attend  it was realli expect to be a good one  and captain wentworth was veri fond of music  if she could onli have a few minut convers with him again  she fanci she should be satisfi  and as to the power of address him  she felt all over courag if the opportun occur  elizabeth had turn from him  ladi russel overlook him  her nerv were strengthen by these circumst  she felt that she owe him attent  she had onc part promis mrs smith to spend the even with her  but in a short hurri call she excus herself and put it off  with the more decid promis of a longer visit on the morrow  mrs smith gave a most good  humour acquiesc   by all mean  said she   onli tell me all about it  when you do come  who is your parti  ann name them all  mrs smith made no repli  but when she was leav her said  and with an express half serious  half arch   well  i heartili wish your concert may answer  and do not fail me to  morrow if you can come  for i begin to have a forebod that i may not have mani more visit from you  ann was startl and confus  but after stand in a moment  s suspens  was oblig  and not sorri to be oblig  to hurri away  chapter 20 sir walter  his two daughter  and mrs clay  were the earliest of all their parti at the room in the even  and as ladi dalrympl must be wait for  they took their station by one of the fire in the octagon room  but hard were they so settl  when the door open again  and captain wentworth walk in alon  ann was the nearest to him  and make yet a littl advanc  she instant spoke  he was prepar onli to bow and pass on  but her gentl  how do you do  brought him out of the straight line to stand near her  and make enquiri in return  in spite of the formid father and sister in the back ground  their be in the back ground was a support to ann  she knew noth of their look  and felt equal to everyth which she believ right to be done  while they were speak  a whisper between her father and elizabeth caught her ear  she could not distinguish  but she must guess the subject  and on captain wentworth  s make a distant bow  she comprehend that her father had judg so well as to give him that simpl acknowledg of acquaint  and she was just in time by a side glanc to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself  this  though late  and reluct  and ungraci  was yet better than noth  and her spirit improv  after talk  howev  of the weather  and bath  and the concert  their convers began to flag  and so littl was said at last  that she was expect him to go everi moment  but he did not  he seem in no hurri to leav her  and present with renew spirit  with a littl smile  a littl glow  he said   i have hard seen you sinc our day at lyme  i am afraid you must have suffer from the shock  and the more from it not overpow you at the time  she assur him that she had not   it was a fright hour  said he   a fright day  and he pass his hand across his eye  as if the remembr were still too pain  but in a moment  half smile again  ad   the day has produc some effect howev  has had some consequ which must be consid as the veri revers of fright  when you had the presenc of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon  you could have littl idea of his be eventu one of those most concern in her recoveri   certain i could have none  but it appear  i should hope it would be a veri happi match  there are on both side good principl and good temper   yes  said he  look not exact forward   but there  i think  end the resembl  with all my soul i wish them happi  and rejoic over everi circumst in favour of it  they have no difficulti to contend with at home  no opposit  no capric  no delay  the musgrov are behav like themselv  most honour and kind  onli anxious with true parent heart to promot their daughter  s comfort  all this is much  veri much in favour of their happi  more than perhap  he stop  a sudden recollect seem to occur  and to give him some tast of that emot which was redden ann  s cheek and fix her eye on the ground  after clear his throat  howev  he proceed thus   i confess that i do think there is a dispar  too great a dispar  and in a point no less essenti than mind  i regard louisa musgrov as a veri amiabl  sweet  temper girl  and not defici in understand  but benwick is someth more  he is a clever man  a read man  and i confess  that i do consid his attach himself to her with some surpris  had it been the effect of gratitud  had he learnt to love her  becaus he believ her to be prefer him  it would have been anoth thing  but i have no reason to suppos it so  it seem  on the contrari  to have been a perfect spontan  untaught feel on his side  and this surpris me  a man like him  in his situat  with a heart pierc  wound  almost broken  fanni harvill was a veri superior creatur  and his attach to her was inde attach  a man doe not recov from such a devot of the heart to such a woman  he ought not  he doe not  either from the conscious  howev  that his friend had recov  or from other conscious  he went no farther  and ann who  in spite of the agit voic in which the latter part had been utter  and in spite of all the various nois of the room  the almost ceaseless slam of the door  and ceaseless buzz of person walk through  had distinguish everi word  was struck  gratifi  confus  and begin to breath veri quick  and feel an hundr thing in a moment  it was imposs for her to enter on such a subject  and yet  after a paus  feel the necess of speak  and have not the smallest wish for a total chang  she onli deviat so far as to say   you were a good while at lyme  i think   about a fortnight  i could not leav it till louisa  s do well was quit ascertain  i had been too deepli concern in the mischief to be soon at peac  it had been my do  sole mine  she would not have been obstin if i had not been weak  the

must be broken up for a time  but slight was the penanc compar with the happi which brought it on  she had learnt  in the last ten minut  more of his feel toward louisa  more of all his feel than she

is no say what may happen  you might  some time or other  be differ affect toward him  hear the truth  therefor  now  while you are unprejud  mr elliot is a man without heart or conscienc  a design  wari  cold  blood be  who think onli of himself  whom for his own interest or eas  would be guilti of ani cruelti  or ani treacheri  that could be perpetr without risk of his general charact  he has no feel for other  those whom he has been the chief caus of lead into ruin  he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunct  he is total beyond the reach of ani sentiment of justic or compass  oh  he is black at heart  hollow and black  ann  s astonish air  and exclam of wonder  made her paus  and in a calmer manner  she ad   my express startl you  you must allow for an injur  angri woman  but i will tri to command myself  i will not abus him  i will onli tell you what i have found him  fact shall speak  he was the intim friend of my dear husband  who trust and love him  and thought him as good as himself  the intimaci had been form befor our marriag  i found them most intim friend  and i  too  becam excess pleas with mr elliot  and entertain the highest opinion of him  at nineteen  you know  one doe not think veri serious  but mr elliot appear to me quit as good as other  and much more agreeabl than most other  and we were almost alway togeth  we were princip in town  live in veri good style  he was then the inferior in circumst  he was then the poor one  he had chamber in the templ  and it was as much as he could do to support the appear of a gentleman  he had alway a home with us whenev he chose it  he was alway welcom  he was like a brother  my poor charl  who had the finest  most generous spirit in the world  would have divid his last farth with him  and i know that his purs was open to him  i know that he often assist him   this must have been about that veri period of mr elliot  s life  said ann   which has alway excit my particular curios  it must have been about the same time that he becam known to my father and sister  i never knew him myself  i onli heard of him  but there was a someth in his conduct then  with regard to my father and sister  and afterward in the circumst of his marriag  which i never could quit reconcil with present time  it seem to announc a differ sort of man   i know it all  i know it all  cri mrs smith   he had been introduc to sir walter and your sister befor i was acquaint with him  but i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invit and encourag  and i know he did not choos to go  i can satisfi you  perhap  on point which you would littl expect  and as to his marriag  i knew all about it at the time  i was privi to all the for and against  i was the friend to whom he confid his hope and plan  and though i did not know his wife previous  her inferior situat in societi  inde  render that imposs  yet i knew her all her life afterward  or at least till within the last two year of her life  and can answer ani question you may wish to put   nay  said ann   i have no particular enquiri to make about her  i have alway understood they were not a happi coupl  but i should like to know whi  at that time of his life  he should slight my father  s acquaint as he did  my father was certain dispos to take veri kind and proper notic of him  whi did mr elliot draw back   mr elliot  repli mrs smith   at that period of his life  had one object in view  to make his fortun  and by a rather quicker process than the law  he was determin to make it by marriag  he was determin  at least  not to mar it by an imprud marriag  and i know it was his belief  whether just or not  of cours i cannot decid  that your father and sister  in their civil and invit  were design a match between the heir and the young ladi  and it was imposs that such a match should have answer his idea of wealth and independ  that was his motiv for draw back  i can assur you  he told me the whole stori  he had no conceal with me  it was curious  that have just left you behind me in bath  my first and princip acquaint on marri should be your cousin  and that  through him  i should be continu hear of your father and sister  he describ one miss elliot  and i thought veri affection of the other   perhap  cri ann  struck by a sudden idea   you sometim spoke of me to mr elliot   to be sure i did  veri often  i use to boast of my own ann elliot  and vouch for your be a veri differ creatur from  she check herself just in time   this account for someth which mr elliot said last night  cri ann   this explain it  i found he had been use to hear of me  i could not comprehend how  what wild imagin one form where dear self is concern  how sure to be mistaken  but i beg your pardon  i have interrupt you  mr elliot marri then complet for money  the circumst  probabl  which first open your eye to his charact  mrs smith hesit a littl here   oh  those thing are too common  when one live in the world  a man or woman  s marri for money is too common to strike one as it ought  i was veri young  and associ onli with the young  and we were a thoughtless  gay set  without ani strict rule of conduct  we live for enjoy  i think differ now  time and sick and sorrow have given me other notion  but at that period i must own i saw noth reprehens in what mr elliot was do   to do the best for himself  pass as a duti   but was not she a veri low woman   yes  which i object to  but he would not regard  money  money  was all that he want  her father was a grazier  her grandfath had been a butcher  but that was all noth  she was a fine woman  had had a decent educ  was brought forward by some cousin  thrown by chanc into mr elliot  s compani  and fell in love with him  and not a difficulti or a scrupl was there on his side  with respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in be secur of the real amount of her fortun  befor he commit himself  depend upon it  whatev esteem mr elliot may have for his own situat in life now  as a young man he had not the smallest valu for it  his chanc for the kellynch estat was someth  but all the honour of the famili he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declar  that if baronetci were saleabl  anybodi should have his for fifti pound  arm and motto  name and liveri includ  but i will not pretend to repeat half that i use to hear him say on that subject  it would not be fair  and yet you ought to have proof  for what is all this but assert  and you shall have proof   inde  my dear mrs smith  i want none  cri ann   you have assert noth contradictori to what mr elliot appear to be some year ago  this is all in confirm  rather  of what we use to hear and believ  i am more curious to know whi he should be so differ now   but for my satisfact  if you will have the good to ring for mari  stay  i am sure you will have the still greater good of go yourself into my bedroom  and bring me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet

mark his profess to my poor husband  can ani thing be stronger  ann could not immedi get over the shock and mortif of find such word appli to her father  she was oblig to recollect that her see the letter was a violat of the law of honour  that no one ought to be judg or to be known by such testimoni  that no privat correspond could bear the eye of other  befor she could recov calm enough to return the letter which she had been medit over  and say   thank you  this is full proof undoubt  proof of everi thing you were say  but whi be acquaint with us now   i can explain this too  cri mrs

will give you my author  his friend colonel walli   colonel walli  you are acquaint with him   no  it doe not come to me in quit so direct a line as that  it take a bend or two  but noth of consequ  the stream is as good as at first  the littl rubbish it collect in the turn is easili move away  mr elliot talk unreserv to colonel walli of his view on you  which said colonel walli  i imagin to be  in himself  a sensibl  care  discern sort of charact  but colonel walli has a veri pretti silli wife  to whom he tell thing which he had better not  and he repeat it all to her  she in the overflow spirit of her recoveri  repeat it all to her nurs  and the nurs know my acquaint with you  veri natur bring it all to me  on monday even  my good friend mrs rook let me thus much into the secret of marlborough build  when i talk of a whole histori  therefor  you see i was not romanc so much as you suppos   my dear mrs smith  your author is defici  this will not do  mr elliot  s have ani view on me will not in the least account for the effort he made toward a reconcili with my father  that was all prior to my come to bath  i found them on the most friend term when i arriv   i know you did  i know it all perfect  but   inde  mrs smith  we must not expect to get real inform in such a line  fact or opinion which are to pass through the hand of so mani  to be misconceiv by folli in one  and ignor in anoth  can hard have much truth left   onli give me a hear  you will soon be abl to judg of the general credit due  by listen to some particular which you can yourself immedi contradict or confirm  nobodi suppos that you were his first induc  he had seen you inde  befor he came to bath  and admir you  but without know it to be you  so say my historian  at least  is this true  did he see you last summer or autumn   somewher down in the west  to use her own word  without know it to be you   he certain did  so far it is veri true  at lyme  i happen to be at lyme   well  continu mrs smith  triumphant   grant my friend the credit due to the establish of the first point assert  he saw you then at lyme  and like you so well as to be exceed pleas to meet with you again in camden place  as miss ann elliot  and from that moment  i have no doubt  had a doubl motiv in his visit there  but there was anoth  and an earlier  which i will now explain  if there is anyth in my stori which you know to be either fals or improb  stop me  my account state  that your sister  s friend  the ladi now stay with you  whom i have heard you mention  came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as septemb  in short when they first came themselv  and has been stay there ever sinc  that she is a clever  insinu  handsom woman  poor and plausibl  and altogeth such in situat and manner  as to give a general idea  among sir walter  s acquaint  of her mean to be ladi elliot  and as general a surpris that miss elliot should be appar  blind to the danger  here mrs smith paus a moment  but ann had not a word to say  and she continu   this was the light in which it appear to those who knew the famili  long befor you return to it  and colonel walli had his eye upon your father enough to be sensibl of it  though he did not then visit in camden place  but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watch all that was go on there  and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two  as he happen to do a littl befor christma  colonel walli made him acquaint with the appear of thing  and the report begin to prevail  now you are to understand  that time had work a veri materi chang in mr elliot  s opinion as to the valu of a baronetci  upon all point of blood and connexion he is a complet alter man  have long had as much money as he could spend  noth to wish for on the side of avaric or indulg  he has been gradual learn to pin his happi upon the consequ he is heir to  i thought it come on befor our acquaint ceas  but it is now a confirm feel  he cannot bear the idea of not be sir william  you may guess  therefor  that the news he heard from his friend could not be veri agreeabl  and you may guess what it produc  the resolut of come back to bath as soon as possibl  and of fix himself here for a time  with the view of renew his former acquaint  and recov such a foot in the famili as might give him the mean of ascertain the degre of his danger  and of circumv the ladi if he found it materi  this was agre upon between the two friend as the onli thing to be done  and colonel walli was to assist in everi way that he could  he was to be introduc  and mrs walli was to be introduc  and everybodi was to be introduc  mr elliot came back accord  and on applic was forgiven  as you know  and re  admit into the famili  and there it was his constant object  and his onli object  till your arriv ad anoth motiv  to watch sir walter and mrs clay  he omit no opportun of be with them  threw himself in their way  call at all hour  but i need not be particular on this subject  you can imagin what an art man would do  and with this guid  perhap  may recollect what you have seen him do   yes  said ann   you tell me noth which doe not accord with what i have known  or could imagin  there is alway someth offens in the detail of cun  the manoeuvr of selfish and duplic must ever be revolt  but i have heard noth which realli surpris me  i know those who would be shock by such a represent of mr elliot  who would have difficulti in believ it  but i have never been satisfi  i have alway want some other motiv for his conduct than appear  i should like to know his present opinion  as to the probabl of the event he has been in dread of  whether he consid the danger to be lessen or not   lessen  i understand  repli mrs smith   he think mrs clay afraid of him  awar that he see through her  and not dare to proceed as she might do in his absenc  but sinc he must be absent some time or other  i do not perceiv how he can ever be secur while she hold her present influenc  mrs walli has an amus idea  as nurs tell me  that it is to be put into the marriag articl when you and mr elliot marri  that your father is not to marri mrs clay  a scheme  worthi of mrs walli  s understand  by all account  but my sensibl nurs rook see the absurd of it   whi  to be sure  ma  am  said she   it would not prevent his marri anybodi els  and  inde  to own the truth  i do not think nurs  in her heart  is a veri strenuous oppos of sir walter  s make a second match  she must be allow to be a favour of matrimoni  you know  and  sinc self will intrud  who can say that she may not have some fli vision of attend the next ladi elliot  through mrs walli  s recommend   i am veri glad to know all this  said ann  after a littl thought   it will be more pain to me in some respect to be in compani with him  but i shall know better what to do  my line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evid a disingenu  artifici  world man  who has never had ani better principl to guid him than selfish  but mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carri away from her first direct  and ann had forgotten  in the interest of her own famili concern  how much had been origin impli against him  but her attent was now call to the explan of those first hint  and she listen to a recit which  if it did not perfect justifi the unqualifi bitter of mrs smith  prove him to have been veri unfeel in his conduct toward her  veri defici both in justic and compass  she learn that  the intimaci between them continu unimpair by mr elliot  s marriag  they had been as befor alway togeth  and mr elliot had led his friend into expens much beyond his fortun  mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself  and was most tender of throw ani on her husband  but ann could collect that their incom had never been equal to their style of live  and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravag  from his wife  s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feel  easi temper  careless habit  and not strong understand  much more amiabl than his friend  and veri unlik him  led by him  and probabl despis by him  mr elliot  rais by his marriag to great affluenc  and dispos to everi gratif of pleasur and vaniti which could be command without involv himself   for with all his self  indulg he had becom a prudent man  and begin to be rich  just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor  seem to have had no concern at all for that friend  s probabl financ  but  on the contrari  had been prompt and encourag expens which could end onli in ruin  and the smith accord had been ruin  the husband had die just in time to be spare the full knowledg of it  they had previous known embarrass enough to tri the friendship of their friend  and to prove that mr elliot  s had better not be tri  but it was not till his death that the wretch state of his affair was fulli known  with a confid in mr elliot  s regard  more credit to his feel than his judgement  mr smith had appoint him the executor of his will  but mr elliot would not act  and the difficulti and distress which this refus had heap on her  in addit to the inevit suffer of her situat  had been such as could not be relat without anguish of spirit  or listen to without correspond indign  ann was shewn some letter of his on the occas  answer to urgent applic from mrs smith  which all breath the same stern resolut of not engag in a fruitless troubl  and  under a cold civil  the same hard  heart indiffer to ani of the evil it might bring on her  it was a dread pictur of ingratitud and inhuman  and ann felt  at some moment  that no flagrant open crime could have been wors  she had a great deal to listen to  all the particular of past sad scene  all the minutia of distress upon distress  which in former convers had been mere hint at  were dwelt on now with a natur indulg  ann could perfect comprehend the exquisit relief  and was onli the more inclin to wonder at the composur of her friend  s usual state of mind  there was one circumst in the histori of her grievanc of particular irrit  she had good reason to believ that some properti of her husband in the west indi  which had been for mani year under a sort of sequestr for the payment of it own incumbr  might be recover by proper measur  and this properti  though not larg  would be enough to make her compar rich  but there was nobodi to stir in it  mr elliot would do noth  and she could do noth herself  equal disabl from person exert by her state of bodili weak  and from employ other by her want of money  she had no natur connexion to assist her even with their counsel  and she could not afford to purchas the assist of the law  this was a cruel aggrav of actual straiten mean  to feel that she ought to be in better circumst  that a littl troubl in the right place might do it  and to fear that delay might be even weaken her claim  was hard to bear  it was on this point that she had hope to engag ann  s good offic with mr elliot  she had previous  in the anticip of their marriag  been veri apprehens of lose her friend by it  but on be assur that he could have made no attempt of that natur  sinc he did not even know her to be in bath  it immedi occur  that someth might be done in her favour by the influenc of the woman he love  and she had been hastili prepar to interest ann  s feel  as far as the observ due to mr elliot  s charact would allow  when ann  s refut of the suppos engag chang the face of everyth  and while it took from her the new  form hope of succeed in the object of her first anxieti  left her at least the comfort of tell the whole stori her own way  after listen to this full descript of mr elliot  ann could not but express some surpris at mrs smith  s have spoken of him so favour in the begin of their convers   she had seem to recommend and prais him   my dear  was mrs smith  s repli   there was noth els to be done  i consid your marri him as certain  though he might not yet have made the offer  and i could no more speak the truth of him  than if he had been your husband  my heart bled for you  as i talk of happi  and yet he is sensibl  he is agreeabl  and with such a woman as you  it was not absolut hopeless  he was veri unkind to his first wife  they were wretch togeth  but she was too ignor and giddi for respect  and he had never love her  i was will to hope that you must fare better  ann could just acknowledg within herself such a possibl of have been induc to marri him  as made her shudder at the idea of the miseri which must have follow  it was just possibl that she might have been persuad by ladi russel  and under such a supposit  which would have been most miser  when time had disclos all  too late  it was veri desir that ladi russel should be no longer deceiv  and one of the conclud arrang of this import confer  which carri them through the greater part of the morn  was  that ann had full liberti to communic to her friend everyth relat to mrs smith  in which his conduct was involv  chapter 22 ann went home to think over all that she had heard  in one point  her feel were reliev by this knowledg of mr elliot  there was no longer anyth of tender due to him  he stood as oppos to captain wentworth  in all his own unwelcom obtrus  and the evil of his attent last night  the irremedi mischief he might have done  was consid with sensat unqualifi  unperplex  piti for him was all over  but this was the onli point of relief  in everi other respect  in look around her  or penetr forward  she saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concern for the disappoint and pain ladi russel would be feel  for the mortif which must be hang over her father and sister  and had all the distress of forese mani evil  without know how to avert ani one of them  she was most thank for her own knowledg of him  she had never consid herself as entitl to reward for not slight an old friend like mrs smith  but here was a reward inde spring from it  mrs smith had been abl to tell her what no one els could have done  could the knowledg have been extend through her famili  but this was a vain idea  she must talk to ladi russel  tell her  consult with her  and have done her best  wait the event with as much composur as possibl  and after all  her greatest want of composur would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be open to ladi russel  in that flow of anxieti and fear which must be all to herself  she found  on reach home  that she had  as she intend  escap see mr elliot  that he had call and paid them a long morn visit  but hard had she congratul herself  and felt safe  when she heard that he was come again in the even   i had not the smallest intent of ask him  said elizabeth  with affect careless   but he gave so mani hint  so mrs clay say  at least   inde  i do say it  i never saw anybodi in my life spell harder for an invit  poor man  i was realli in pain for him  for your hard  heart sister  miss ann  seem bent on cruelti   oh  cri elizabeth   i have been rather too much use to the game to be soon overcom by a gentleman  s hint  howev  when i found how excess he was regret that he should miss my father this morn  i gave way immedi  for i would never realli omit an opportun of bring him and sir walter togeth  they appear to so much advantag in compani with each other  each behav so pleasant  mr elliot look up with so much respect   quit delight  cri mrs clay  not dare  howev  to turn her eye toward ann   exact like father and son  dear miss elliot  may i not say father and son   oh  i lay no embargo on ani bodi  s word  if you will have such idea  but  upon my word  i am scarc sensibl of his attent be beyond those of other men   my dear miss elliot  exclaim mrs clay  lift her hand and eye  and sink all the rest of her astonish in a conveni silenc   well  my dear penelop  you need not be so alarm about him  i did invit him  you know  i sent him away with smile  when i found he was realli go to his friend at thornberri park for the whole day to  morrow  i had compass on him  ann admir the good act of the friend  in be abl to shew such pleasur as she did  in the expect and in the actual arriv of the veri person whose presenc must realli be interf with her prime object  it was imposs but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot  and yet she could assum a most oblig  placid look  and appear quit satisfi with the curtail licens of devot herself onli half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwis  to ann herself it was most distress to see mr elliot enter the room  and quit pain to have him approach and speak to her  she had been use befor to feel that he could not be alway quit sincer  but now she saw insincer in everyth  his attent defer to her father  contrast with his former languag  was odious  and when she thought of his cruel conduct toward mrs smith  she could hard bear the sight of his present smile and mild  or the sound of his artifici good sentiment  she meant to avoid ani such alter of manner as might provok a remonstr on his side  it was a great object to her to escap all enquiri or eclat  but it was her intent to be as decid cool to him as might be compat with their relationship  and to retrac  as quiet as she could  the few step of unnecessari intimaci she had been gradual led along  she was accord more guard  and more cool  than she had been the night befor  he want to anim her curios again as to how and where he could have heard her former prais  want veri much to be gratifi by more solicit  but the charm was broken  he found that the heat and anim of a public room was necessari to kindl his modest cousin  s vaniti  he found  at least  that it was not to be done now  by ani of those attempt which he could hazard among the too  command claim of the other  he littl surmis that it was a subject act now exact against his interest  bring immedi to her thought all those part of his conduct which were least excus  she had some satisfact in find that he was realli go out of bath the next morn  go earli  and that he would be gone the greater part of two day  he was invit again to camden place the veri even of his return  but from thursday to saturday even his absenc was certain  it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be alway befor her  but that a deeper hypocrit should be ad to their parti  seem the destruct of everyth like peac and comfort  it was so humili to reflect on the constant decept practis on her father and elizabeth  to consid the various sourc of mortif prepar for them  mrs clay  s selfish was not so complic nor so revolt as his  and ann would have compound for the marriag at onc  with all it evil  to be clear of mr elliot  s subtleti in endeavour to prevent it  on friday morn she meant to go veri earli to ladi russel  and accomplish the necessari communic  and she would have gone direct after breakfast  but that mrs clay was also go out on some oblig purpos of save her sister troubl  which determin her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion  she saw mrs clay fair off  therefor  befor she began to talk of spend the morn in river street   veri well  said elizabeth   i have noth to send but my love  oh  you may as well take back that tiresom book she would lend me  and pretend i have read it through  i realli cannot be plagu myself for ever with all the new poem and state of the nation that come out  ladi russel quit bore one with her new public  you need not tell her so  but i thought her dress hideous the other night  i use to think she had some tast in dress  but i was asham of her at the concert  someth so formal and arrang in her air  and she sit so upright  my best love  of cours   and mine  ad sir walter   kindest regard  and you may say  that i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil messag  but i shall onli leav my card  morn visit are never fair by women at her time of life  who make themselv up so littl  if she would onli wear roug she would not be afraid of be seen  but last time i call  i observ the blind were let down immedi  while her father spoke  there was a knock at the door  who could it be  ann  rememb the preconcert visit  at all hour  of mr elliot  would have expect him  but for his known engag seven mile off  after the usual period of suspens  the usual sound of approach were heard  and  mr and mrs charl musgrov  were usher into the room  surpris was the strongest emot rais by their appear  but ann was realli glad to see them  and the other were not so sorri but that they could put on a decent air of welcom  and as soon as it becam clear that these  their nearest relat  were not arriv with an view of accommod in that hous  sir walter and elizabeth were abl to rise in cordial  and do the honour of it veri well  they were come to bath for a few day with mrs musgrov  and were at the white hart  so much was pretti soon understood  but till sir walter and elizabeth were walk mari into the other draw  room  and regal themselv with her admir  ann could not draw upon charl  s brain for a regular histori of their come  or an explan of some smile hint of particular busi  which had been ostentati drop by mari  as well as of some appar confus as to whom their parti consist of  she then found that it consist of mrs musgrov  henrietta  and captain harvill  besid their two selv  he gave her a veri plain  intellig account of the whole  a narrat in which she saw a great deal of most characterist proceed  the scheme had receiv it first impuls by captain harvill  s want to come to bath on busi  he had begun to talk of it a week ago  and by way of do someth  as shoot was over  charl had propos come with him  and mrs harvill had seem to like the idea of it veri much  as an advantag to her husband  but mari could not bear to be left  and had made herself so unhappi about it  that for a day or two everyth seem to be in suspens  or at an end  but then  it had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother had some old friend in bath whom she want to see  it was thought a good opportun for henrietta to come and buy wed  cloth for herself and her sister  and  in short  it end in be his mother  s parti  that everyth might be comfort and easi to captain harvill  and he and mari were includ in it by way of general conveni  they had arriv late the night befor  mrs harvill  her children  and captain benwick  remain with mr musgrov and louisa at uppercross  ann  s onli surpris was  that affair should be in forward enough for henrietta  s wed  cloth to be talk of  she had imagin such difficulti of fortun to exist there as must prevent the marriag from be near at hand  but she learn from charl that  veri recent   sinc mari  s last letter to herself  charl hayter had been appli to by a friend to hold a live for a youth who could not possibl claim it under mani year  and that on the strength of his present incom  with almost a certainti of someth more perman long befor the term in question  the two famili had consent to the young peopl  s wish  and that their marriag was like to take place in a few month  quit as soon as louisa  s   and a veri good live it was  charl ad   onli five  and  twenti mile from uppercross  and in a veri fine countri  fine part of dorsetshir  in the centr of some of the best preserv in the kingdom  surround by three great proprietor  each more care and jealous than the other  and to two of the three at least  charl hayter might get a special recommend  not that he will valu it as he ought  he observ   charl is too cool about sport  that  s the worst of him   i am extrem glad  inde  cri ann   particular glad that this should happen  and that of two sister  who both

 and i am sure he has alway been a veri kind  liber father to me  mari doe not abov half like henrietta  s match  she never did  you know  but she doe not do him justic  nor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend to the valu of the properti  it is a veri fair match  as time go  and i have like charl hayter all my life  and i shall not leav off now   such excel parent as mr

five minut togeth  she general thought he would come  becaus she general thought he ought  but it was a case which she could not so shape into ani posit act of duti or discret  as inevit to defi the suggest of veri opposit feel  she onli rous herself from the brood of this restless agit  to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hour after his be suppos to be out of bath  for have watch in vain for some intim of the interview from the ladi herself  she determin to mention it  and it seem to her there was guilt in mrs clay  s face as she listen  it was transient  clear

the next morn  still to defer her explanatori visit in river street  she had promis to be with the musgrov from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plight  and mr elliot  s charact  like the sulta

all the agit which she had mere laid her account of tast a littl befor the morn close  there was no delay  no wast of time  she was deep in the happi of such miseri  or the miseri of such happi  instant  two minut after her enter the room  captain wentworth said   we will write the letter we were talk of  harvill  now  if you will give me materi  materi were at hand  on a separ tabl  he went to it  and near turn his back to them all  was engross by write  mrs musgrov was give mrs croft the histori of her eldest daughter  s engag  and just in that inconveni tone of voic which was perfect audibl while it pretend to be a whisper  ann felt that she did not belong to the convers  and yet  as captain harvill seem thought and not dispos to talk  she could not avoid hear mani undesir particular  such as   how mr musgrov and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over  what my brother hayter had said one day  and what mr musgrov had propos the next  and what had occur to my sister hayter  and what the young peopl had wish  and what i said at first i never could consent to  but was afterward persuad to think might do veri well  and a great deal in the same style of open  heart communic  minutia which  even with everi advantag of tast and delicaci  which good mrs musgrov could not give  could be proper interest onli to the princip  mrs croft was attend with great good  humour  and whenev she spoke at all  it was veri sensibl  ann hope the gentlemen might each be too much self  occupi to hear   and so  ma  am  all these thing consid  said mrs musgrov  in her power whisper   though we could have wish it differ  yet  altogeth  we did not think it fair to stand out ani longer  for charl hayter was quit wild about it  and henrietta was pretti near as bad  and so we thought they had better marri at onc  and make the best of it  as mani other have done befor them  at ani rate  said i  it will be better than a long engag   that is precis what i was go to observ  cri mrs croft   i would rather have young peopl settl on a small incom at onc  and have to struggl with a few difficulti togeth  than be involv in a long engag  i alway think that no mutual   oh  dear mrs croft  cri mrs musgrov  unabl to let her finish her speech   there is noth i so abomin for young peopl as a long engag  it is what i alway protest against for my children  it is all veri well  i use to say  for young peopl to be engag  if there is a certainti of their be abl to marri in six month  or even in twelv  but a long engag   yes  dear ma  am  said mrs croft   or an uncertain engag  an engag which may be long  to begin without know that at such a time there will be the mean of marri  i hold to be veri unsaf and unwis  and what i think all parent should prevent as far as they can  ann found an unexpect interest here  she felt it applic to herself  felt it in a nervous thrill all over her  and at the same moment that her eye instinct glanc toward the distant tabl  captain wentworth  s pen ceas to move  his head was rais  paus  listen  and he turn round the next instant to give a look  one quick  conscious look at her  the two ladi continu to talk  to re  urg the same admit truth  and enforc them with such exampl of the ill effect of a contrari practic as had fallen within their observ  but ann heard noth distinct  it was onli a buzz of word in her ear  her mind was in confus  captain harvill  who had in truth been hear none of it  now left his seat  and move to a window  and ann seem to watch him  though it was from thorough absenc of mind  becam gradual sensibl that he was invit her to join him where he stood  he look at her with a smile  and a littl motion of the head  which express   come to me  i have someth to say  and the unaffect  easi kind of manner which denot the feel of an older acquaint than he realli was  strong enforc the invit  she rous herself and went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladi were sit  and though nearer to captain wentworth  s tabl  not veri near  as she join him  captain harvill  s counten re  assum the serious  thought express which seem it natur charact   look here  said he  unfold a parcel in his hand  and display a small miniatur paint   do you know who that is   certain  captain benwick   yes  and you may guess who it is for  but   in a deep tone   it was not done for her  miss elliot  do you rememb our walk togeth at lyme  and griev for him  i littl thought then  but no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met with a clever young german artist at the cape  and in complianc with a promis to my poor sister  sat to him  and was bring it home for her  and i have now the charg of get it proper set for anoth  it was a commiss to me  but who els was there to employ  i hope i can allow for him  i am not sorri  inde  to make it over to anoth  he undertak it   look toward captain wentworth   he is write about it now  and with a

  it would not be the natur of ani woman who truli love  captain harvill smile  as much as to say   do you claim that for your sex  and she answer the question  smile also   yes  we certain do not forget you as soon as you forget us  it is  perhap  our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselv  we live at home  quiet  confin  and our feel prey upon us  you are forc on exert  you have

our littl famili circl  ever sinc   true  said ann   veri true  i did not recollect  but what shall we say now  captain harvill  if the chang be not from outward circumst  it must be from within  it must be natur  man  s natur  which has done the busi for captain benwick   no  no  it is not man  s natur  i will not allow it to be more man  s natur than woman  s to be inconst and forget those they do love  or have love  i believ the revers  i believ in a true analog between our bodili frame and our mental  and that as our bodi are the strongest  so are our feel  capabl of bear most rough usag  and ride out the heaviest weather   your feel may be the strongest  repli ann   but the same spirit of analog will authoris me to assert that our are the most tender  man is more robust than woman

men have had everi advantag of us in tell their own stori  educ has been their in so much higher a degre  the pen has been in their hand  i will not allow book to prove anyth   but how shall we prove anyth   we never shall  we never can expect to prove ani thing upon such a point  it is a differ of opinion which doe not admit of proof  we each begin  probabl  with a littl bias toward our own sex  and upon that bias build everi circumst in favour of it which has occur within our own circl  mani of which circumst  perhap those veri case which strike us the most  may be precis such as cannot be brought forward without betray a confid  or in some respect say what should not be said   ah  cri captain harvill  in a tone of strong feel   if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffer when he take a last look at his wife and children  and watch the boat that he has sent them off in  as long as it is in sight  and then turn away and say   god know whether we ever meet again  and then  if

had been gradual yield to the better hope which her look  or word  or action occasion encourag  it had been vanquish at last by those sentiment and those tone which had reach him while she talk with captain harvill  and under the irresist govern of which he had seiz a sheet of paper  and pour out his feel  of what he had then written  noth was to be retract or qualifi  he persist in have love none but her  she had never been supplant  he never even believ himself to see her equal  thus much inde he was oblig to acknowledg  that he had been constant unconsci  nay unintent  that he had meant

though till that day  till the leisur for reflect which follow it  he had not understood the perfect excel of the mind with which louisa  s could so ill bear a comparison  or the perfect unrival hold it possess over his own  there  he had learnt to distinguish between the steadi of principl and the obstinaci of self  will  between the dare of heedless and the resolut of a collect mind  there he had seen everyth to exalt in his estim the woman he had lost  and there begun to deplor the pride  the folli  the mad of resent  which had kept him from tri to regain her when thrown in his way  from that period his penanc had becom sever  he had no sooner been free from the horror and remors attend the first few day of louisa  s accid  no sooner begun to feel himself aliv again  than he had begun to feel himself  though aliv  not at liberti   i found  said he   that i was consid by harvill an engag man  that neither harvill nor his wife entertain a doubt of our mutual attach  i was startl and shock  to a degre  i could contradict this instant  but  when i began to reflect that other might have felt the same  her own famili  nay  perhap herself  i was no longer at my own dispos  i was her in honour if she wish it  i had been unguard  i had not thought serious on this subject befor  i had not consid that my excess intimaci must have it danger of ill consequ in mani way  and that i had no right to be tri whether i could attach myself to either of the girl  at the risk of rais even an unpleas report  were there no other ill effect  i had been grossli wrong  and must abid the consequ  he found too late  in short  that he had entangl himself  and that precis as he becam fulli satisfi of his not care for louisa at all  he must regard himself as bound to her  if her sentiment for him were what the harvill suppos  it determin him to leav lyme  and await her complet recoveri elsewher  he would glad weaken  by ani fair mean  whatev feel or specul concern him might exist  and he went  therefor  to his brother  s  mean after a while to return to kellynch  and act as circumst might requir   i was six week with edward  said he   and saw him happi  i could have no other pleasur  i deserv none  he enquir after you veri particular  ask even if you were person alter  littl suspect that to my eye you could never alter  ann smile  and let it pass  it was too pleas a blunder for a

it with former word  and feel it to be the result  not the caus of a reviv of his warm attach  he had remain in shropshir  lament the blind of his own pride  and the blunder of his own calcul  till at onc releas from louisa by the astonish and felicit intellig of her engag with benwick   here  said he   end the worst of my state  for now i could at least put myself in the way of happi  i could exert myself  i could do someth  but to be wait so long in inact  and wait onli for evil  had been dread  within the first five minut i said   i will be at bath on wednesday  and i was  was it unpardon to think it worth my while to come  and to arriv with some degre of hope  you were singl  it was possibl that you might retain the feel of the past  as i did  and one encourag happen to be mine  i could never doubt that you would be love and sought by other  but i knew to a certainti that you had refus one man  at least  of better pretens than myself  and i could not help often say   was this for me  their first meet in milsom street afford much to be said  but the concert still more  that even seem to be made up of exquisit moment  the moment of her step forward in the octagon

look on without agoni  was not the veri sight of the friend who sat behind you  was not the recollect of what had been  the knowledg of her influenc  the indel  immov impress of what persuas had onc done  was it not all against me   you should have distinguish  repli ann   you should not have suspect me now  the case is so differ  and my age is so differ  if i was wrong in yield to persuas onc  rememb that it was to persuas exert on the side of safeti  not of risk  when i yield  i thought it was to duti  but no duti could be call in aid here  in marri a man indiffer to me  all risk would have been incur  and all duti violat   perhap i ought to have reason thus  he repli   but i could not  i could not deriv benefit from the late knowledg i had acquir of your charact  i could not bring it into play  it was overwhelm  buri  lost in those earlier feel which i had been smart under year after year  i could think of you onli as one who had yield  who had given me up  who had been influenc by ani one rather than by me  i saw you with the veri person who had guid you in that year of miseri  i had no reason to believ her of less author now  the forc of habit was to be ad   i should have thought  said ann   that my manner to yourself might have spare you much or all of this   no  no  your manner might be onli the eas which your engag to anoth man would give  i left you in this belief  and yet  i was determin to see you again  my spirit ralli with the morn  and i felt that i had still a motiv for remain here  at last ann was at home again  and happier than ani one in

too often  a commonplac busi  too numer for intimaci  too small for varieti  but ann had never found an even shorter  glow and love in sensibl and happi  and more general admir than she thought about or care for  she had cheer or forbear feel for everi creatur around her  mr elliot was there  she avoid  but she could piti him  the wallis  she had amus in understand them  ladi dalrympl and miss carteret  they would soon be innoxi cousin to her  she care not for mrs clay  and had noth to blush for in the public manner of her father and sister  with the musgrov  there was the happi chat of perfect eas  with captain harvill  the kind  heart intercours of brother and sister  with ladi russel  attempt at convers  which a delici conscious cut short  with admir and mrs croft  everyth of

and wrong  i mean with regard to myself  and i must believ that i was right  much as i suffer from it  that i was perfect right in be guid by the friend whom you will love better than you do now  to me  she was in the place of a parent  do not mistak me  howev  i am not say that she did not err in her advic  it was  perhap  one of those case in which advic is good or bad onli as the event decid  and for myself  i certain never should  in ani circumst of toler similar  give such advic  but i mean  that i was right in submit to her  and that if i had done otherwis  i should have suffer more in continu the engag than i did even in give it up  becaus i should have suffer in my conscienc  i have now  as far as such a sentiment is allow in human natur  noth to reproach myself with  and if i mistak not  a strong sens of duti is no bad part of a woman  s portion  he look at her  look at ladi russel  and look again at her  repli  as if in cool deliber   not yet  but there are hope of her be forgiven in time  i trust to be in chariti with her soon  but i too have been think over the past  and a question has suggest itself  whether there may not have been one person more my enemi even than that ladi  my own self  tell me if  when i return to england in the year eight  with a few thousand pound  and was post into the laconia  if i had then written to you  would you have answer my letter  would you  in short  have renew the engag then   would i  was all her answer  but the accent was decis enough   good god  he cri   you would  it is not that i did not think of it  or desir it  as what could alon crown all my other success  but i was proud  too proud to ask again  i did not understand you  i shut my eye  and would not understand you  or do you justic  this is a recollect which ought to make me forgiv everi one sooner than myself  six year of separ and suffer might have been spare  it is a sort of pain  too  which is new to me  i have been use to the gratif of believ myself to earn everi bless that i enjoy  i have valu myself on honour toil and just reward  like other great men under revers  he ad  with a smile   i must endeavour to subdu my mind to my fortun  i must learn to brook be happier than i deserv  chapter 24 who can be in doubt of what follow  when ani two young peopl take it into their head to marri  they are pretti sure by persever to carri their point  be they ever so poor  or ever so imprud  or ever so littl like to be necessari to each other  s ultim comfort  this may be bad moral to conclud with  but i believ it to be truth  and if such parti succeed  how should a captain wentworth and an ann elliot  with the advantag of matur of mind  conscious of right  and one independ fortun between them  fail of bear down everi opposit  they might in fact  have born down a great deal more than they met with  for there was littl to distress them beyond the want of gracious and warmth  sir walter made no object  and elizabeth did noth wors than look cold and unconcern  captain wentworth  with five  and  twenti thousand pound  and as high in his profess as merit and activ could place him  was no longer nobodi  he was now esteem quit worthi to address the daughter of a foolish  spendthrift baronet  who had not had principl or sens enough to maintain himself in the situat in which provid had place him  and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pound which must be her hereaft  sir walter  inde  though he had no affect for ann  and no vaniti flatter  to make him realli happi on the occas  was veri far from think it a bad match for her  on the contrari  when he saw more of captain wentworth  saw him repeat by daylight  and eye him well  he was veri much struck by his person claim  and felt that his superior of appear might be not unfair balanc against her superior of rank  and all this  assist by his well  sound name  enabl sir walter at last to prepar his pen  with a veri good grace  for the insert of the marriag in the volum of honour  the onli one among them  whose opposit of feel could excit ani serious anxieti was ladi russel  ann knew that ladi russel must be suffer some pain in understand and relinquish mr elliot  and be make some struggl to becom truli acquaint with  and do justic to captain wentworth  this howev was what ladi russel had now to do  she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both  that she had been unfair influenc by appear in each  that becaus captain wentworth  s manner had not suit her own idea  she had been too quick in suspect them to indic a charact of danger impetuos  and that becaus mr elliot  s manner had precis pleas her in their proprieti and correct  their general polit and suaviti  she had been too quick in receiv them as the certain result of the most correct opinion and well  regul mind  there was noth less for ladi russel to do  than to admit that she had been pretti complet wrong  and to take up a new set of opinion and of hope  there is a quick of percept in some  a niceti in the discern of charact  a natur penetr  in short  which no experi in other can equal  and ladi russel had been less gift in this part of understand than her young friend  but she was a veri good woman  and if her second object was to be sensibl and well  judg  her first was to see ann happi  she love ann better than she love her own abil  and when the awkward of the begin was over  found littl hardship in attach herself as a mother to the man who was secur the happi of her other child  of all the famili  mari was probabl the one most immedi gratifi by the circumst  it was credit to have a sister marri  and she might flatter herself with have been great instrument to the connexion  by keep ann with her in the autumn  and as her own sister must be better than her husband  s sister  it was veri agreeabl that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charl hayter  she had someth to suffer  perhap  when they came into contact again  in see ann restor to the right of senior  and the mistress of a veri pretti landaulett  but she had a futur to look forward to  of power consol  ann had no uppercross hall befor her  no land estat  no headship of a famili  and if they could but keep captain wentworth from be made a baronet  she would not chang situat with ann  it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equal satisfi with her situat  for a chang is not veri probabl there  she had soon the mortif of see mr elliot withdraw  and no one of proper condit has sinc present himself to rais even the unfound hope which sunk with him  the news of his cousin ann  s engag burst on mr elliot most unexpect  it derang his best plan of domest happi  his best hope of keep sir walter singl by the watch which a son  in  law  s right would have given  but  though discomfit and disappoint  he could still do someth for his own interest and his own enjoy  he soon quit bath  and on mrs clay  s quit it soon afterward  and be next heard of as establish under his protect in london  it was evid how doubl a game he had been play  and how determin he was to save himself from be cut out by one art woman  at least  mrs clay  s affect had overpow her interest  and she had sacrif  for the young man  s sake  the possibl of scheme longer for sir walter  she has abil  howev  as well as affect  and it is now a doubt point whether his cun  or her  may final carri the day  whether  after prevent her from be the wife of sir walter  he may not be wheedl and caress at last into make her the wife of sir william  it cannot be doubt that sir walter and elizabeth were shock and mortifi by the loss of their companion  and the discoveri of their decept in her  they had their great cousin  to be sure  to resort to for comfort  but they must long feel that to flatter and follow other  without be flatter and follow in turn  is but a state of half enjoy  ann  satisfi at a

which a man of sens could valu  there she felt her own inferior veri keen  the disproport in their fortun was noth  it did not give her a moment  s regret  but to have no famili to receiv and estim him proper  noth of respect  of harmoni  of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcom which met her in his brother and sister  was a sourc of as live pain as her mind could well be sensibl of under circumst of otherwis strong felic  she had but two friend in the world to add to his list  ladi russel and mrs smith  to those  howev  he was veri well dispos to attach

 instead of depriv her of one friend  secur her two  she was their earliest visitor in their settl life  and captain wentworth  by put her in the way of recov her husband  s properti in the west indi
