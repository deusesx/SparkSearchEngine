besought the lord his god  and said  lord  whi doth thi wrath wax hot against thi peopl  which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power  and with a mighti hand  32  12 wherefor should the egyptian speak  and say  for mischief did he bring them out  to slay them in the mountain  and to consum them from the face of the earth  turn from thi fierc wrath  and repent of this evil against thi peopl  32  13 rememb abraham  isaac  and israel  thi servant  to whom thou swarest by thine own self  and saidst unto them  i will multipli your seed as the star of heaven  and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed  and they shall inherit it for ever  32  14 and the lord repent of the evil which he thought to do unto his peopl  32  15 and mose turn  and went down from the mount  and the two tabl of the testimoni were in his hand  the tabl were written on both their side  on the one side and on the other were they written  32  16 and the tabl were the work of god  and the write was the write of god  graven upon the tabl  32  17 and when joshua heard the nois of the peopl as they shout  he said unto mose  there is a nois of war in the camp  32  18 and he said  it is not the voic of them that shout for masteri  neither is it the voic of them that cri for be overcom  but the nois of them that sing do i hear  32  19 and it came to pass  as soon as he came nigh unto the camp  that he saw the calf  and the danc  and mose  anger wax hot  and he cast the tabl out of his hand  and brake them beneath the mount  32  20 and he took the calf which they had made  and burnt it in the fire  and ground it to powder  and straw it upon the water  and made the children of israel drink of it  32  21 and mose said unto aaron  what did this peopl unto thee  that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them  32  22 and aaron said  let not the anger of my lord wax hot  thou knowest the peopl  that they are set on mischief  32  23 for they said unto me  make us god  which shall go befor us  for as for this mose  the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt  we wot not what is becom of him  32  24 and i said unto them  whosoev hath ani gold  let them break it off  so they gave it me  then i cast it into the fire  and there came out this calf  32  25 and when mose saw that the peopl were nake   for aaron had made them nake unto their shame among their enemi  32  26 then mose stood in the gate of the camp  and said  who is on the lord  s side  let him come unto me  and all the son of levi gather themselv togeth unto him  32  27 and he said unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  put everi man his sword by his side  and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp  and slay everi man his brother  and everi man his companion  and everi man his neighbour  32  28 and the children of levi did accord to the word of mose  and there fell of the peopl that day about three thousand men  32  29 for mose had said  consecr yourselv today to the lord  even everi man upon his son  and upon his brother  that he may bestow upon you a bless this day  32  30 and it came to pass on the morrow  that mose said unto the peopl  ye have sin a great sin  and now i will go up unto the lord  peradventur i shall make an aton for your sin  32  31 and mose return unto the lord  and said  oh  this peopl have sin a great sin  and have made them god of gold  32  32 yet now  if thou wilt forgiv their sin  and if not  blot me  i pray thee  out of thi book which thou hast written  32  33 and the lord said unto mose  whosoev hath sin against me  him will i blot out of my book  32  34 therefor now go  lead the peopl unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee  behold  mine angel shall go befor thee  nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them  32  35 and the lord plagu the peopl  becaus they made the calf  which aaron made  33  1 and the lord said unto mose  depart  and go up henc  thou and the peopl which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt  unto the land which i sware unto abraham  to isaac  and to jacob  say  unto thi seed will i give it  33  2 and i will send an angel befor thee  and i will drive out the canaanit  the amorit  and the hittit  and the perizzit  the hivit  and the jebusit  33  3 unto a land flow with milk and honey  for i will not go up in the midst of thee  for thou art a stiffneck peopl  lest i consum thee in the way  33  4 and when the peopl heard these evil tide  they mourn  and no man did put on him his ornament  33  5 for the lord had said unto mose  say unto the children of israel  ye are a stiffneck peopl  i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment  and consum thee  therefor now put off thi ornament from thee  that i may know what to do unto thee  33  6 and the children of israel strip themselv of their ornament by the mount horeb  33  7 and mose took the tabernacl  and pitch it without the camp  afar off from the camp  and call it the tabernacl of the congreg  and it came to pass  that everi one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacl of the congreg  which was without the camp  33  8 and it came to pass  when

the son of nun  a young man  depart not out of the tabernacl  33  12 and mose said unto the lord  see  thou sayest unto me  bring up this peopl  and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with

gracious to whom i will be gracious  and will shew merci on whom i will shew merci  33  20 and he said  thou canst not see my face  for there shall no man see me  and live  33  21 and the lord said  behold  there is a place by me  and thou shalt stand upon a rock  33  22 and it shall come to pass  while my glori passeth by  that i will put thee in a clift of the rock  and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by  33  23 and i will take away mine hand  and thou shalt see my back part  but my face shall not be seen  34  1 and the lord said unto mose  hew thee two tabl of stone like unto the

20 but the man that shall be unclean  and shall not purifi himself  that soul shall be cut off from among the congreg  becaus he hath defil the sanctuari of the lord  the water of separ hath not been sprinkl upon him  he is unclean  19  21 and it shall be a perpetu statut unto them  that he that sprinkleth the water of separ shall wash his cloth  and he that toucheth the water of separ shall be unclean until even  19  22 and whatsoev the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean  and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even  20  1 then came the children of israel  even the whole congreg  into the desert of zin in the first month  and the peopl abod in kadesh  and miriam die there  and was buri there  20  2 and there was no water for the congreg  and they gather themselv togeth against mose and against aaron  20  3 and the peopl chode with mose  and spake  say  would god that we had die when our brethren die befor the lord  20  4 and whi have ye brought up the congreg of the lord into this wilder  that we and our cattl should die there  20  5 and wherefor have ye made us to come up out of egypt  to bring us in unto this evil place  it is no place of seed  or of fig  or of vine  or of pomegran  neither is there ani water to drink  20  6 and mose and aaron went from the presenc of the assembl unto the door of the tabernacl of the congreg  and they fell upon their face  and the glori of the lord appear unto them  20  7 and the lord spake unto mose  say  20  8 take the rod  and gather thou the assembl togeth  thou  and aaron thi brother  and speak ye unto the rock befor their eye  and it shall give forth his water  and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock  so thou shalt give the congreg and their beast drink  20  9 and mose took the rod from befor the lord  as he command him  20  10 and mose and aaron gather the congreg togeth befor the rock  and he said unto them  hear now  ye rebel  must we fetch you water out of this rock  20  11 and mose lift up his hand  and with his rod he smote the rock twice  and the water came out abund  and the congreg drank  and their beast also  20  12 and the lord spake unto mose and aaron  becaus ye believ me not  to sanctifi me in the eye of the children of israel  therefor ye shall not bring this congreg into the land which i have given them  20  13 this is the water of meribah  becaus the children of israel strove with the lord  and he was sanctifi in them  20  14 and mose sent messeng from kadesh unto the king of edom  thus saith thi brother israel  thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us  20  15 how our father went down into egypt  and we have dwelt in egypt a long time  and the egyptian vex us  and our father  20  16 and when we cri unto the lord  he heard our voic  and sent an angel  and hath brought us forth out of egypt  and  behold  we are in kadesh  a citi in the uttermost of thi border  20  17 let us pass  i pray thee  through thi countri  we will not pass through the field  or through the vineyard  neither will we drink of the water of the well  we will go by the king  s high way  we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left  until we have pass thi border  20  18 and edom said unto him  thou shalt not pass by me  lest i come out against thee with the sword  20  19 and the children of israel said unto him  we will go by the high way  and if i and my cattl drink of thi water  then i will pay for it  i will onli  without do anyth els  go through on my feet  20  20 and he said  thou shalt not go through  and edom came out against him with much peopl  and with a strong hand  20  21 thus edom refus to give israel passag through his border  wherefor israel turn away from him  20  22 and the children of israel  even the whole congreg  journey from kadesh  and came unto mount hor  20  23 and the lord spake unto mose and aaron in mount hor  by the coast of the land of edom  say  20  24 aaron shall be gather unto his peopl  for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel  becaus ye rebel against my word at the water of meribah  20  25 take aaron and eleazar his son  and bring them up unto mount hor  20  26 and strip aaron of his garment  and put them upon eleazar his son  and aaron shall be gather unto his peopl  and shall die there  20  27 and mose did as the lord command  and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congreg  20  28 and mose strip aaron of his garment  and put them upon eleazar his son  and aaron die there in the top of the mount  and mose and eleazar came down from the mount  20  29 and when all the congreg saw that aaron was dead  they mourn for aaron thirti day  even all the hous of israel  21  1 and when king arad the canaanit  which dwelt in the south  heard tell that israel came by the way of the spi  then he fought against israel  and took some of them prison  21  2 and israel vow a vow unto the lord  and said  if thou wilt inde deliv this peopl into my hand  then i will utter destroy their citi  21  3 and the lord hearken to the voic of israel  and deliv up the canaanit  and they utter destroy them and their citi  and he call the name of the place hormah  21  4 and they journey from mount hor by the way of the red sea  to compass the land of edom  and the soul of the peopl was much discourag becaus of the way  21  5 and the peopl spake against god  and against mose  wherefor have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilder  for there is no bread  neither is there ani water  and our soul loatheth this light bread  21  6 and the lord sent fieri serpent among the peopl  and they bit the peopl  and much peopl of israel die  21  7 therefor the peopl came to mose  and said  we have sin  for we have spoken against the lord  and against thee  pray unto the lord  that he take away the serpent from us  and mose pray for the peopl  21  8 and the lord said unto mose  make thee a fieri serpent  and set it upon a pole  and it shall come to pass  that everi one that is bitten  when he looketh upon it  shall live  21  9 and mose made a serpent of brass  and put it upon a pole  and it came to pass  that if a serpent had bitten ani man  when he beheld the serpent of brass  he live  21  10 and the children of israel set forward  and pitch in oboth  21  11 and they journey from oboth  and pitch at ijeabarim  in the wilder which is befor moab  toward the sunris  21  12 from thenc they remov  and pitch in the valley of zare  21  13 from thenc they remov  and pitch on the other side of arnon  which is in the wilder that cometh out of the coast of the amorit  for arnon is the border of moab  between moab and the amorit  21  14 wherefor it is said in the book of the war of the lord  what he did in the red sea  and in the brook of arnon  21  15 and at the stream of the brook that goeth down to the dwell of ar  and lieth upon the border of moab  21  16 and from thenc they went to beer  that is the well whereof the lord spake unto mose  gather the peopl togeth  and i will give them water  21  17 then israel sang this song  spring up  o well  sing ye unto it  21  18 the princ dig the well  the nobl of the peopl dig it  by the direct of the lawgiv  with their stave  and from the wilder they went to mattanah  21  19 and from mattanah to nahaliel  and from nahaliel to bamoth  21  20 and from bamoth in the valley  that is in the countri of moab  to the top of pisgah  which looketh toward jeshimon  21  21 and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit  say  21  22 let me pass through thi land  we will not turn into the field  or into the vineyard  we will not drink of the water of the well  but we will go along by the king  s high way  until we be past thi border  21  23 and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border  but sihon gather all his peopl togeth  and went out against israel into the wilder  and he came to jahaz  and fought against israel  21  24 and israel smote him with the edg of the sword  and possess his land from arnon unto jabbok  even unto the children of ammon  for the border of the children of ammon was strong  21  25 and israel took all these citi  and israel dwelt in all the citi of the amorit  in heshbon  and in all the villag thereof  21  26 for heshbon was the citi of sihon the king of the amorit  who had fought against the former king of moab  and taken all his land out of his hand  even unto arnon  21  27 wherefor they that speak in proverb say  come into heshbon  let the citi of sihon be built and prepar  21  28 for there is a fire gone out of heshbon  a flame from the citi of sihon  it hath consum ar of moab  and the lord of the high place of arnon  21  29 woe to thee  moab  thou art undon  o peopl of chemosh  he hath given his son that escap  and his daughter  into captiv unto sihon king of the amorit  21  30 we have shot at them  heshbon is perish even unto dibon  and we have laid them wast even unto nophah  which reacheth unto medeba  21  31 thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorit  21  32 and mose sent to spi out jaazer  and they took the villag thereof  and drove out the amorit that were there  21  33 and they turn and went up by the way of bashan  and og the king of bashan went out against them  he  and all his peopl  to the battl at edrei  21  34 and the lord said unto mose  fear him not  for i have deliv him into thi hand  and all his peopl  and his land  and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorit  which dwelt at heshbon  21  35 so they smote him  and his son  and all his peopl  until there was none left him aliv  and they possess his land  22  1 and the children of israel set forward  and pitch in the plain of moab on this side jordan by jericho  22  2 and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorit  22  3 and moab was sore afraid of the peopl  becaus they were mani  and moab was distress becaus of the children of israel  22  4 and moab said unto the elder of midian  now shall this compani lick up all that are round about us  as the ox licketh up the grass of the field  and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabit at that time  22  5 he sent messeng therefor unto balaam the son of beor to pethor  which is by the river of the land of the children of his peopl  to call him  say  behold  there is a peopl come out from egypt  behold  they cover the face of the earth  and they abid over against me  22  6 come now therefor  i pray thee  curs me this peopl  for they are too mighti for me  peradventur i shall prevail  that we may smite them  and that i may drive them out of the land  for i wot that he whom thou blessest is bless  and he whom thou cursest is curs  22  7 and the elder of moab and the elder of midian depart with the reward of divin in their hand  and they came unto balaam  and spake unto him the word of balak  22  8 and he said unto them  lodg here this night  and i will bring you word again  as the lord shall speak unto me  and the princ of moab abod with balaam  22  9 and god came unto balaam  and said  what men are these with thee  22  10 and balaam said unto god  balak the son of zippor  king of moab  hath sent unto me  say  22  11 behold  there is a peopl come out of egypt  which covereth the face of the earth  come now  curs me them  peradventur i shall be abl to overcom them  and drive them out  22  12 and god said unto balaam  thou shalt not go with them  thou shalt not curs the peopl  for they are bless  22  13 and balaam rose up in the morn  and said unto the princ of balak  get you into your land  for the lord refuseth to give me leav to go with you  22  14 and the princ of moab rose up  and they went unto balak  and said  balaam refuseth to come with us  22  15 and balak sent yet again princ  more  and more honour than they  22  16 and they came to balaam  and said to him  thus saith balak the son of zippor  let noth  i pray thee  hinder thee from come unto me  22  17 for i will promot thee unto veri great honour  and i will do whatsoev thou sayest unto me  come therefor  i pray thee  curs me this peopl  22  18 and balaam answer and said unto the servant of balak  if balak would give me his hous full of silver and gold  i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god  to do less or more  22  19 now therefor  i pray you  tarri ye also here this night  that i may know what the lord will say unto me more  22  20 and god came unto balaam at night  and said unto him  if the men come to call thee  rise up  and go with them  but yet the word which i shall say unto thee  that shalt thou do  22  21 and balaam rose up in the morn  and saddl his ass  and went with the princ of moab  22  22 and god  s anger was kindl becaus he went  and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversari against him  now he was ride upon his ass  and his two servant were with him  22  23 and the ass saw the angel of the lord stand in the way  and his sword drawn in his hand  and the ass turn asid out of the way  and went into the field  and balaam smote the ass  to turn her into the way  22  24 but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyard  a wall be on this side  and a wall on that side  22  25 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord  she thrust herself unto the wall  and crush balaam  s foot against the wall  and he smote her again  22  26 and the angel of the lord went further  and stood in a narrow place  where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left  22  27 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord  she fell down under balaam  and balaam  s anger was kindl  and he smote the ass with a staff  22  28 and the lord open the mouth of the ass  and she said unto balaam  what have i done unto thee  that thou hast smitten me these three time  22  29 and balaam said unto the ass  becaus thou hast mock me  i would there were a sword in mine hand  for now would i kill thee  22  30 and the ass said unto balaam  am not i thine ass  upon which thou hast ridden ever sinc i was thine unto this day  was i ever wont to do so unto thee  and he said  nay  22  31 then the lord open the eye of balaam  and he saw the angel of the lord stand in the way  and his sword drawn in his hand  and he bow down his head  and fell flat on his face  22  32 and the angel of the lord said unto him  wherefor hast thou smitten thine ass these three time  behold  i went out to withstand thee  becaus thi way is pervers befor me  22  33 and the ass saw me  and turn from me these three time  unless she had turn from me  sure now also i had slain thee  and save her aliv  22  34 and balaam said unto the angel of the lord  i have sin  for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me  now therefor  if it displeas thee  i will get me back again  22  35 and the angel of the lord said unto balaam  go with the men  but onli the word that i shall speak unto thee  that thou shalt speak  so balaam went with the princ of balak  22  36 and when balak heard that balaam was come  he went out to meet him unto a citi of moab  which is in the border of arnon  which is in the utmost coast  22  37 and balak said unto balaam  did i not earnest send unto thee to call thee  wherefor camest thou not unto me  am i not abl inde to promot thee to honour  22  38 and balaam said unto balak  lo  i am come unto thee  have i now ani power at

of the peopl  23  1 and balaam said unto balak  build me here seven altar  and prepar me here seven oxen and seven ram  23  2 and balak did as balaam had spoken  and balak and balaam offer on everi altar a bullock and a ram  23  3 and balaam said unto balak  stand by thi burnt offer  and i will go  peradventur the lord will come to meet me  and whatsoev he sheweth me i will tell thee  and he went to an high place  23  4 and god met balaam  and he said unto him  i have prepar seven altar  and i have offer upon everi altar a bullock and a ram  23  5 and the lord put a word in balaam  s mouth  and said  return unto balak  and thus thou shalt speak  23  6 and he return unto him  and  lo  he stood by his burnt sacrific  he  and all the princ of moab  23  7 and he took up his parabl  and said  balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram  out of the mountain of the east  say  come  curs me jacob  and come  defi israel  23  8 how shall i curs  whom god hath not curs  or how

10 who can count the dust of jacob  and the number of the fourth part of israel  let me die the death of the righteous  and let my last end be like his  23  11 and balak said unto balaam  what hast thou done unto me  i took thee to curs mine enemi  and  behold  thou hast bless them altogeth  23  12 and he answer and said  must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth  23  13 and balak said unto him  come  i pray thee  with me unto anoth place  from whenc thou mayest see them  thou shalt see but the utmost part of them  and shalt not see them all  and curs me them from thenc  23  14 and he brought him into the field of zophim  to the top of pisgah  and built seven altar  and offer a bullock and a ram on everi altar  23  15 and he said unto balak  stand here by thi burnt offer  while i meet the lord yonder  23  16 and the lord met balaam  and put a word in his mouth  and said  go again unto balak  and say thus  23  17 and when he came to him  behold  he stood by his burnt offer  and the princ of moab with him  and balak said unto him  what hath the lord spoken  23  18 and he took up his parabl  and said  rise up  balak  and hear  hearken unto me  thou son of zippor  23  19 god is not a man  that he should lie  neither the son of man  that he should repent  hath he said  and shall he not do it  or hath he spoken  and shall he not make it good  23  20 behold  i have receiv command to bless  and he hath bless  and i cannot revers it  23  21 he hath not beheld iniqu in jacob  neither hath he seen pervers in israel  the lord his god is with him  and the shout of a king is among them  23  22 god brought them out of egypt  he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn  23  23 sure there is no enchant against jacob  neither is there ani divin

shall not lie down until he eat of the prey  and drink the blood of the slain  23  25 and balak said unto balaam  neither curs them at all  nor bless them at all  23  26 but balaam answer and said unto balak  told not i thee  say  all that the lord speaketh  that i must do  23  27 and balak said unto balaam  come  i pray thee  i will bring thee unto anoth place  peradventur it will pleas god that thou mayest curs me them from thenc  23  28 and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor  that looketh toward jeshimon  23  29 and balaam said unto balak  build me here seven altar  and prepar me here seven bullock and seven ram  23  30 and balak did as balaam had said  and offer a bullock and a ram on everi altar  24  1 and when balaam saw that it pleas the lord to bless israel  he went not  as at other time  to seek for enchant  but he set his face toward the wilder  24  2 and balaam lift up his eye  and he saw israel abid in his tent accord to their tribe  and the spirit of god came upon him  24  3 and he took up his parabl  and said  balaam the son of beor hath said  and the man whose eye are open hath said  24  4 he hath said  which heard the word of god  which saw the vision of the almighti  fall into a tranc  but have his eye open  24  5 how good are thi tent  o jacob  and thi tabernacl  o israel  24  6 as the valley are they spread forth  as garden by the river  s side  as the tree of lign alo which the lord hath plant  and as cedar tree besid the water  24  7 he shall pour the water out of his bucket  and his seed shall be in mani water  and his king shall

24  10 and balak  s anger was kindl against balaam  and he smote his hand togeth  and balak said unto balaam  i call thee to curs mine enemi  and  behold  thou hast altogeth bless them these three time  24  11 therefor now flee thou to thi place  i thought to promot thee unto great honour  but  lo  the lord hath kept thee back from honour  24  12 and balaam said unto balak  spake i not also to thi messeng which thou sentest unto me  say  24  13 if balak would give me his hous full of silver and gold  i cannot go beyond the command of the lord  to do either good or bad of mine own mind  but what the lord saith  that will i speak  24  14 and now  behold  i go unto my peopl  come therefor  and i will advertis thee what this peopl shall do to thi peopl in the latter day  24  15 and he took up his parabl  and said  balaam the son of beor hath said  and the man whose eye are open hath said  24  16 he hath said  which heard the word of god  and knew the knowledg of the most high  which saw the vision of the almighti  fall into a tranc  but have his eye open  24  17 i shall see him  but not now  i shall behold him  but not nigh  there shall come a star out of jacob  and a sceptr shall rise out of israel  and shall smite the corner of moab  and destroy all the children of sheth  24  18 and edom shall be a possess  seir also shall be a possess for his enemi  and israel shall do valiant  24  19 out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion  and shall destroy him that remaineth of the citi  24  20 and when he look on amalek  he took up his parabl  and said  amalek was the first of the nation  but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever  24  21 and he look on the kenit  and took up his parabl  and said  strong is thi dwellingplac  and thou puttest thi nest in a rock  24  22 nevertheless the kenit shall be wast  until asshur shall carri thee away captiv  24  23 and he took up his parabl  and said  ala  who shall live when god doeth this  24  24 and ship shall come from the coast of chittim  and shall afflict asshur  and shall afflict eber  and he also shall perish for ever  24  25 and balaam rose up  and went and return to his place  and balak also went his way  25  1 and israel abod in shittim  and the peopl began to commit whoredom with the daughter of moab  25  2 and they call the peopl unto the sacrific of their god  and the peopl did eat  and bow down to their god  25  3 and israel join himself unto baalpeor  and the anger of the lord was kindl against israel  25  4 and the lord said unto mose  take all the head of the peopl  and hang them up befor the lord against the sun  that the fierc anger of the lord may be turn away from israel  25  5 and mose said unto the judg of israel  slay ye everi one his men that were join unto

twelv men of you  one of a tribe  1  24 and they turn and went up into the mountain  and came unto the valley of eshcol  and search it out  1  25 and they took of the fruit of the land in their hand  and brought it down unto us  and brought us word again  and said  it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us  1  26 notwithstand ye would not go up  but rebel against the command of the lord your god  1  27 and ye murmur in your tent  and said  becaus the lord hate us  he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt  to deliv us into the hand of the amorit  to destroy us  1  28 whither shall we go up  our brethren have discourag our heart  say  the peopl is greater and taller than we  the citi are great and wall up to heaven  and moreov we have seen the son of the anakim there  1  29 then i said unto you  dread not  neither be afraid of them  1  30 the lord your god which goeth befor you  he shall fight for you  accord to all that he did for you in egypt befor your eye  1  31 and in the wilder  where thou hast seen how that the lord thi god bare thee  as a man doth bear his son  in all the way that ye went  until ye came into this place  1  32 yet in this thing ye did not believ the lord your god  1  33 who went in the way befor you  to search you out a place to pitch your tent in  in fire by night  to shew you by what way ye should go  and in a cloud by day  1  34 and the lord heard the voic of your word  and was wroth  and sware  say  1  35 sure there shall not one of these men of this evil generat see that good land  which i sware to give unto your

give it  and they shall possess it  1  40 but as for you  turn you  and take your journey into the wilder by the way of the red sea  1  41 then ye answer and said unto me  we have sin against the lord  we will go up and fight  accord to all that the lord our god command us  and when ye had gird on everi man his weapon of war  ye were readi to go up into the hill  1  42 and the lord said unto me  say unto them  go not up  neither fight  for i am not among you  lest ye be smitten befor your enemi  1  43 so i spake unto you  and ye would not hear  but rebel against the command of the lord  and

walk through this great wilder  these forti year the lord thi god hath been with thee  thou hast lack noth  2  8 and when we pass by from our brethren the children of esau  which dwelt in seir  through the way of the plain from elath  and from eziongab  we turn and pass by the way of the wilder of moab  2  9 and the lord said unto me  distress not the moabit  neither contend with them in battl  for i will not give thee of their land for a possess  becaus i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possess  2  10 the emim dwelt therein in time past  a peopl great  and mani  and tall

destroy them from befor them  and dwelt in their stead  as israel did unto the land of his possess  which the lord gave unto them  2  13 now rise up  said i  and get you over the brook zere  and we went over the brook zere  2  14 and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea  until we were come over the brook zere  was thirti and eight year  until all the generat of the men of war were wast out from among the host  as the lord sware unto them  2  15 for inde the hand of the lord was against them  to destroy them from among the host  until they were consum  2  16 so it came to pass  when all the men of war were consum and dead from among the peopl  2  17 that the lord spake unto me  say  2  18 thou art to pass over through ar  the coast of moab  this day  2  19 and when thou comest

lord destroy them befor them  and they succeed them  and dwelt in their stead  2  22 as he did to the children of esau  which dwelt in seir  when he destroy the horim from befor them  and they succeed them  and dwelt in their stead even unto this day  2  23 and the avim which dwelt in hazerim  even unto azzah  the caphtorim  which came forth out of caphtor  destroy them  and dwelt in their stead  2  24 rise ye up  take your journey  and pass over the river arnon  behold  i have given into thine hand sihon the amorit  king of heshbon  and his land  begin to possess it  and contend with him in battl  2  25 this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nation that are under the whole heaven  who shall hear report of thee  and shall trembl  and be in anguish becaus of thee  2  26 and i sent messeng out of the wilder of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with word of peac  say  2  27 let me pass through thi land  i will go along by the high way  i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left  2  28 thou shalt sell me meat for money  that i may eat  and give me water for money  that i may drink  onli i will pass through on my feet  2  29  as the children of esau which dwell in seir  and the moabit which dwell in ar  did unto me  until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us  2  30 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him  for the lord thi god harden his spirit  and made his heart obstin  that he might deliv him into thi hand  as appeareth this day  2  31 and the lord said unto me  behold  i have begun to give sihon and his land befor thee  begin to possess  that thou mayest inherit his land  2  32 then sihon came out against us  he and all his peopl  to fight at jahaz  2  33 and the

thou didst unto sihon king of the amorit  which dwelt at heshbon  3  3 so the lord our god deliv into our hand og also  the king of bashan  and all his peopl  and we smote him until none was left to

but all the cattl  and the spoil of the citi  we took for a prey to ourselv  3  8 and we took at that time out of the hand of the two king of the amorit the land that was on this side jordan  from the

which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt  and unto all his land  11  4 and what he did unto the armi of egypt  unto their hors  and to their chariot  how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursu after you  and how the lord hath destroy them unto this day  11  5 and what he did unto you in the wilder  until ye came into this place  11  6 and what he did unto dathan and abiram  the son of eliab  the son of reuben  how the earth open her mouth  and swallow them up  and their household  and their tent  and all the substanc that was in their possess  in the midst of all israel  11  7 but your eye have seen all the great act of the lord which he did  11  8 therefor shall ye keep all the command which i command you this day  that ye may be strong

floweth with milk and honey  11  10 for the land  whither thou goest in to possess it  is not as the land of egypt  from whenc ye came out  where thou sowedst thi seed  and wateredst it with thi foot  as a garden of herb  11  11 but the land  whither ye go to possess it  is a land of hill and valley  and drinketh water of the rain of heaven  11  12 a land which the lord thi god careth for  the eye

yield not her fruit  and lest ye perish quick from off the good land which the lord giveth you  11  18 therefor shall ye lay up these my word in your heart and in your soul  and bind them for a sign upon your hand  that they may be as frontlet between your eye  11  19 and ye shall teach them your children  speak of them when thou sittest in thine hous  and when thou walkest by the way  when thou

 that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken  but the prophet hath spoken it presumptu  thou shalt not be afraid of him  19  1 when the lord thi god hath cut off the nation  whose land the lord thi god giveth thee  and thou succeedest them  and dwellest in their citi  and in their hous  19  2 thou shalt separ three citi for thee in the midst of thi land  which the lord thi god giveth thee to possess it  19  3 thou shalt prepar thee a way  and divid the coast of thi land  which the lord thi god giveth thee to inherit  into three part  that everi slayer may flee thither  19  4 and this is the case of the slayer  which shall flee thither  that he may live  whoso killeth his neighbour ignor  whom he hate not in time past  19  5 as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood  and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree  and the head slippeth from the helv  and lighteth upon his neighbour  that he die  he shall flee unto one of those citi  and live  19  6 lest the aveng of the blood pursu the slayer  while his heart is hot  and overtak him  becaus the way is long  and slay him  wherea he was not worthi of death  inasmuch as he hate him not in time past  19  7 wherefor i command thee  say  thou shalt separ three citi for thee  19  8 and if the lord thi god enlarg thi coast  as he hath sworn unto thi father  and give thee all the land which he promis to give unto thi father  19  9 if thou shalt keep all these command to do them  which i command thee this day  to love the lord thi god  and to walk ever in his way  then shalt thou

thenc  and deliv him into the hand of the aveng of blood  that he may die  19  13 thine eye shall not piti him  but thou shalt put away the guilt of innoc blood from israel  that it may go well with thee  19  14 thou shalt not remov thi neighbour  s landmark  which they of old time have set in thine inherit  which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thi god giveth thee to possess it  19  15 one wit shall not rise up against a man for ani iniqu  or for ani sin  in ani sin that he sinneth  at the mouth of two wit  or at the mouth of three wit  shall the matter be establish  19  16 if a fals wit rise up against ani man to testifi against him that which is wrong  19  17 then both the men  between whom the controversi is  shall stand befor the lord  befor the priest and the judg  which shall be in those day  19  18 and the judg shall make dilig inquisit  and  behold  if the wit be a fals wit  and hath testifi fals against his brother  19  19 then shall ye do unto him  as he had thought to have done unto his brother  so shalt thou put the evil away from among you  19  20 and those which remain shall hear  and fear  and shall henceforth commit no more ani such evil among you  19  21 and thine eye shall not piti  but life shall go for life  eye for eye  tooth for tooth  hand for hand  foot for foot  20  1 when thou goest out to battl against thine enemi  and seest hors  and

thereof is brimston  and salt  and burn  that it is not sown  nor beareth  nor ani grass groweth therein  like the overthrow of sodom  and gomorrah  admah  and zeboim  which the lord overthrew in his anger  and in his wrath  29  24 even all nation shall say  wherefor hath the lord done thus unto this land  what meaneth the heat of this great anger  29  25 then men shall say  becaus they have forsaken the coven of the lord god of their father  which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt  29  26 for they went and serv other god  and worship them  god whom they knew not  and whom he had not given unto them  29  27 and the anger of the lord was kindl against this land  to bring upon it all the curs that are written in this book  29  28 and the lord root

30  12 it is not in heaven  that thou shouldest say  who shall go up for us to heaven  and bring it unto us  that we may hear it  and do it  30  13 neither is it beyond the sea  that thou shouldest say  who shall go over the sea for us  and bring it unto us  that we may hear it  and do it  30  14 but the word is veri nigh unto thee  in thi mouth  and in thi heart  that thou mayest do it  30  15 see  i have set befor thee this day life and good  and death and evil  30  16 in that i command thee this day to love the lord thi god  to walk in his way  and to keep his command and his statut and

12 so the lord alon did lead him  and there was no strang god with him  32  13 he made him ride on the high place of the earth  that he might eat the increas of the field  and he made him to suck honey out of the rock  and oil out of the flinti rock  32  14 butter of kine  and milk of sheep  with fat of lamb  and ram of the breed of bashan  and goat  with the fat of kidney of wheat  and thou

they have move me to jealousi with that which is not god  they have provok me to anger with their vaniti  and i will move them to jealousi with those which are not a peopl  i will provok them to anger

them  with the poison of serpent of the dust  32  25 the sword without  and terror within  shall destroy both the young man and the virgin  the suckl also with the man of gray hair  32  26 i said  i would scatter them into corner  i would make the remembr of them to ceas from among men  32  27 were it not that i fear the wrath of the enemi  lest their adversari should behav themselv strang  and lest they should say  our hand is high  and the lord hath not done all this  32  28 for they are a nation void of counsel  neither is there ani understand in them  32  29 o that they were wise  that they understood this  that they would consid their latter end  32  30 how should one chase a thousand  and two put ten thousand to flight  except their rock had sold them  and the lord had shut them up  32  31 for their rock is not as our rock  even our enemi themselv be judg  32  32 for their vine is of the vine of sodom  and of the field of gomorrah  their grape are grape of gall  their cluster

 their foot shall slide in due time  for the day of their calam is at hand  and the thing that shall come upon them make hast  32  36 for the lord shall judg his peopl  and repent himself for his servant  when he seeth that their power is gone  and there is none shut up  or left  32  37 and he shall say  where are their god  their rock in whom they trust  32  38 which did eat the fat of their sacrific  and drank the wine of their drink offer  let them rise up and help you  and be your protect  32  39 see now that i  even i  am he  and there is no god with me  i kill  and i make aliv  i

judgment  i will render vengeanc to mine enemi  and will reward them that hate me  32  42 i will make mine arrow drunk with blood  and my sword shall devour flesh  and that with the blood of the slain and of the captiv  from the begin of reveng upon the enemi  32  43 rejoic  o ye nation  with his peopl  for he will aveng the blood of his servant  and will render vengeanc to his adversari  and will

when joshua was by jericho  that he lift up his eye and look  and  behold  there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand  and joshua went unto him  and said unto him  art thou for us  or for our adversari  5  14 and he said  nay  but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come  and joshua fell on his face to the earth  and did worship  and said unto him  what saith my lord unto his servant  5  15 and the captain of the lord  s host said unto joshua  loos thi shoe from off thi foot  for the place whereon thou standest is holi  and joshua did so  6  1 now jericho was strait shut up becaus of the children of israel  none went out  and none came in  6  2 and the lord said unto joshua  see  i have given into thine hand jericho  and the king thereof  and the mighti

when ye hear the sound of the trumpet  all the peopl shall shout with a great shout  and the wall of the citi shall fall down flat  and the peopl shall ascend up everi man straight befor him  6  6 and joshua the son of nun call the priest  and said unto them  take up the ark of the coven  and let seven priest bear seven trumpet of ram  horn befor the ark of the lord  6  7 and he said unto the peopl  pass on  and compass the citi  and let him that is arm pass on befor the ark of the lord  6  8 and it came to pass  when joshua had spoken unto the peopl  that the seven priest bear the seven trumpet of ram  horn pass on befor the lord  and blew with the trumpet  and the ark of the coven of the lord follow them  6  9 and the arm men went befor the priest that blew with the trumpet  and the rereward came after the ark  the priest go on  and blow with the trumpet  6  10 and joshua had command the peopl  say  ye shall not shout  nor make ani nois with your voic  neither shall ani word proceed out of your mouth  until the day i bid you shout  then shall ye shout  6  11 so the ark of the lord compass the citi  go about it onc  and they came into the camp  and lodg in the camp  6  12

day they compass the citi seven time  6  16 and it came to pass at the seventh time  when the priest blew with the trumpet  joshua said unto the peopl  shout  for the lord hath given you the citi  6  17 and the citi shall be accurs  even it  and all that are therein  to the lord  onli rahab the harlot shall live  she and all that are with her in the hous  becaus she hid the messeng that we sent  6  18 and ye  in ani wise keep yourselv from the accurs thing  lest ye make yourselv accurs  when ye take of the accurs thing  and make the camp of israel a curs  and troubl it  6  19 but all the silver  and gold  and vessel of brass and iron  are consecr unto the lord  they shall come into the treasuri of the lord  6  20 so the peopl shout when the priest blew with the trumpet  and it came to pass  when the peopl heard the sound of the trumpet  and the peopl shout with a great shout  that the wall fell down flat  so that the peopl went up into the citi  everi man straight befor him  and they took the citi  6  21 and they utter destroy all that was in the citi  both man and woman  young and old  and ox  and sheep  and ass  with the edg of the sword  6  22 but joshua had said unto the two men that had spi out the countri  go into the harlot  s hous  and bring out thenc the woman  and all that she hath  as ye sware unto her  6  23 and the young men that were spi went in  and brought out rahab  and her father  and her mother  and her brethren  and all that she had  and they brought out all her kindr  and left them without the camp of israel  6  24 and they burnt the citi with fire  and all that was therein  onli the silver  and the gold  and the vessel of brass and of iron  they put into the treasuri of the hous of the lord  6  25 and joshua save rahab the harlot aliv  and her father  s household  and all that she had  and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day  becaus she hid the messeng  which joshua sent to spi out jericho  6  26 and joshua adjur them at that time  say  curs be the man befor the lord  that riseth up and buildeth this citi jericho  he shall lay the foundat thereof in his firstborn  and in his youngest son shall he set up the gate of it  6  27 so the lord was with joshua  and his fame was nois throughout all the countri  7  1 but the children of israel commit a trespass in the accurs thing  for achan  the son of carmi  the son of zabdi  the son of zerah  of the tribe of judah  took of the accurs thing  and the anger of the lord was kindl against the children of israel  7  2 and joshua sent men from jericho to ai  which is besid bethaven  on the east of bethel  and spake unto them  say  go up and view the countri  and the men went up and view ai  7  3 and they return to joshua  and said unto him  let not all the peopl go up  but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai  and make not all the peopl to labour thither  for they are but few  7  4 so there went up thither of the peopl about three thousand men  and they fled befor the men of ai  7  5 and the men of ai smote of them about thirti and six men  for they chase them from befor the gate even unto shebarim  and smote them in the go down  wherefor the heart of the peopl melt  and becam as water  7  6 and joshua rent his cloth  and fell to the earth upon his face befor the ark of the lord until the eventid  he and the elder of israel  and put dust upon their head  7  7 and joshua said  ala  o lord god  wherefor hast thou at all brought this peopl over jordan  to deliv us into the hand of the amorit  to destroy us  would to god we had been content  and dwelt on the other side jordan  7  8 o lord  what shall i say  when israel turneth their back befor their enemi  7  9 for the canaanit and all the inhabit of the land shall hear of it  and shall environ us round  and cut off our name from the earth  and what wilt thou do unto thi great name  7  10 and the lord said unto joshua  get thee up  wherefor liest thou thus upon thi face  7  11 israel hath sin  and they have also transgress my coven which i command them  for they have even taken of the accurs thing  and have also stolen  and dissembl also  and they have put it even among their own stuff  7  12 therefor the children of israel could not stand befor their enemi  but turn their back befor their enemi  becaus they were accurs  neither will i be with you ani more  except ye destroy the accurs from among you  7  13 up  sanctifi the peopl  and say  sanctifi yourselv against to morrow  for thus saith the lord god of israel  there is an accurs thing in the midst of thee  o israel  thou canst not stand befor thine enemi  until ye take away the accurs thing from among you  7  14 in the morn therefor ye shall be brought accord to your tribe  and it shall be  that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come accord to the famili thereof  and the famili which the lord shall take shall come by household  and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man  7  15 and it shall be  that he that is taken with the accurs thing shall be burnt with fire  he and all that he hath  becaus he hath transgress the coven of the lord  and becaus he hath wrought folli in israel  7  16 so joshua rose up earli in the morn  and brought israel by their tribe  and the tribe of judah was taken  7  17 and he brought the famili of judah  and he took the famili of the zarhit  and he

jacob and his children went down into egypt  24  5 i sent mose also and aaron  and i plagu egypt  accord to that which i did among them  and afterward i brought you out  24  6 and i brought your

amorit  which dwelt on the other side jordan  and they fought with you  and i gave them into your hand  that ye might possess their land  and i destroy them from befor you  24  9 then balak the son of zippor  king of moab  aros and war against israel  and sent and call balaam the son of beor to curs you  24  10 but i would not hearken unto balaam  therefor he bless you still  so i deliv you out of

hivit  and the jebusit  and i deliv them into your hand  24  12 and i sent the hornet befor you  which drave them out from befor you  even the two king of the amorit  but not with thi sword  nor with thi bow  24  13 and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour  and citi which ye built not  and ye dwell in them  of the vineyard and oliveyard which ye plant not do ye eat  24  14 now therefor fear the lord  and serv him in sincer and in truth  and put away the god which your father serv on the other side of the flood  and in egypt  and serv ye the lord  24  15 and if it seem evil unto you to serv the lord  choos you this day whom ye will serv  whether the god which your father serv that were on the other side of the flood  or the god of the amorit  in whose land ye dwell  but as for me and my hous  we will serv the lord  24  16 and the peopl answer and said  god forbid that we should forsak the lord  to serv other god  24  17 for the lord our god  he it is that brought us up and our father out of the land of egypt  from the hous of bondag  and which did those great sign in our sight  and preserv us in all the way wherein we went  and among all the peopl through whom we pass  24  18 and the lord drave out from befor us all the peopl  even the amorit which dwelt in the land  therefor will we also serv the lord  for he is our god  24  19 and joshua said unto the peopl  ye cannot serv the lord  for he is an holi god  he is a jealous god  he will not forgiv your transgress nor your sin  24  20 if ye forsak the lord  and serv strang god  then he will turn and do you hurt  and consum you  after that he hath done you good  24  21 and the peopl said unto joshua  nay  but we will serv the lord  24  22 and joshua said unto the peopl  ye are wit against yourselv that ye have chosen you the lord  to serv him  and they said  we are wit  24  23 now therefor put away  said he  the strang god which are among you  and inclin your heart unto the lord god of israel  24  24 and the peopl said unto joshua  the lord our god will we serv  and his voic will we obey  24  25 so joshua made a coven with the peopl that day  and set them a statut and an ordin in shechem  24  26 and joshua wrote these word in the book of the law of god  and took a great stone  and set it up there under an oak  that was by the sanctuari of the lord  24  27 and joshua said unto all the peopl  behold  this stone shall be a wit unto us  for it hath heard all the word of the lord which he spake unto us  it shall be therefor a wit unto you  lest ye deni your god  24  28 so joshua let the peopl depart  everi man unto his inherit  24  29 and it came to pass after these thing  that joshua the son of nun  the servant of the lord  die  be an hundr and ten year old  24  30 and they buri him

of israel ask the lord  say  who shall go up for us against the canaanit first  to fight against them  1  2 and the lord said  judah shall go up  behold  i have deliv the land into his hand  1  3 and judah said unto simeon his brother  come up with me into my lot  that we may fight against the canaanit  and i likewis will go with thee into thi lot  so simeon went with him  1  4 and judah went up  and the lord deliv the canaanit and the perizzit into their hand  and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men  1  5 and they found adonibezek in bezek  and they fought against him  and they slew the canaanit and the perizzit  1  6 but adonibezek fled  and they pursu after him  and caught him  and cut off his thumb and his great toe  1  7 and adonibezek said  threescor and ten king  have their thumb and their great toe cut off  gather their meat under my tabl  as i have done  so god hath requit me  and they brought him to jerusalem  and there he die  1  8 now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem  and had taken it  and smitten it with the edg of the sword  and set the citi on fire  1  9 and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanit  that dwelt in the mountain  and in the south  and in the valley  1  10 and judah went against the canaanit that dwelt in hebron   now the name of hebron befor was kirjatharba  and they slew sheshai  and ahiman  and talmai  1  11 and from thenc he went against the inhabit of debir  and the name of debir befor was kirjathseph  1  12 and caleb said  he that smiteth kirjathseph  and taketh it  to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife  1  13 and othniel the son of kenaz  caleb  s younger brother  took it  and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife  1  14 and it came to pass  when she came to

south land  give me also spring of water  and caleb gave her the upper spring and the nether spring  1  16 and the children of the kenit  mose  father in law  went up out of the citi of palm tree with the children of judah into the wilder of judah  which lieth in the south of arad  and they went and dwelt among the peopl  1  17 and judah went with simeon his brother  and they slew the canaanit that inhabit zephath  and utter destroy it  and the name of the citi was call hormah  1  18 also judah took gaza with the coast thereof  and askelon with the coast thereof  and ekron with the coast thereof  1  19 and the lord was with judah  and he drave out the inhabit of the mountain  but could not drive out the inhabit of the valley  becaus they had chariot of iron  1  20 and they gave hebron unto caleb  as mose said  and he expel thenc the three son of anak  1  21 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusit that inhabit jerusalem  but the jebusit dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day  1  22 and the hous of joseph  they also went up against bethel  and the lord was with them  1  23 and the hous of joseph sent to descri bethel   now the name of the citi befor was luz  1  24 and the spi saw a man come forth out of the citi  and they said unto him  shew us  we pray thee  the entranc into the citi  and we will shew thee merci  1  25 and when he shew them the entranc into the citi  they smote the citi with the edg of the sword  but they let go the man and all his famili  1  26 and the man went into the land of the hittit  and built a citi

lord  nor yet the work which he had done for israel  2  11 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and serv baalim  2  12 and they forsook the lord god of their father  which brought them out of the land of egypt  and follow other god  of the god of the peopl that were round about them  and bow themselv unto them  and provok the lord to anger  2  13 and they forsook the

and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab  and eglon was a veri fat man  3  18 and when he had made an end to offer the present  he sent away the peopl that bare the present  3  19 but he

follow after me  for the lord hath deliv your enemi the moabit into your hand  and they went down after him  and took the ford of jordan toward moab  and suffer not a man to pass over  3  29 and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men  all lusti  and all men of valour  and there escap not a man  3  30 so moab was subdu that day under the hand of israel  and the land had rest fourscor year  3  31 and after him was shamgar the son of anath  which slew of the philistin six hundr men with an ox goad  and he also deliv israel  4  1 and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord  when ehud was dead  4  2 and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan  that reign in hazor  the captain of whose host was sisera  which dwelt in harosheth of the gentil  4  3 and the children of israel cri unto the lord  for he had nine hundr chariot of iron  and twenti year he mightili oppress the children of israel  4  4 and deborah  a prophetess  the wife of lapidoth  she judg israel at that time  4  5 and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim  and the children of israel came up to her for judgment  4  6 and she sent

into thine hand  4  8 and barak said unto her  if thou wilt go with me  then i will go  but if thou wilt not go with me  then i will not go  4  9 and she said  i will sure go with thee  notwithstand the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour  for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman  and deborah aros  and went with barak to kedesh  4  10 and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh  and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet  and deborah went up with him  4  11 now heber the kenit  which was of the children of hobab the father in law of mose  had sever

togeth all his chariot  even nine hundr chariot of iron  and all the peopl that were with him  from harosheth of the gentil unto the river of kishon  4  14 and deborah said unto barak  up  for this is the day in which the lord hath deliv sisera into thine hand  is not the lord gone out befor thee  so barak went down from mount tabor  and ten thousand men after him  4  15 and the lord discomfit sisera  and all his chariot  and all his host  with the edg of the sword befor barak  so that sisera light down off his chariot  and fled away on his feet  4  16 but barak pursu after the chariot  and

the wife of heber the kenit  for there was peac between jabin the king of hazor and the hous of heber the kenit  4  18 and jael went out to meet sisera  and said unto him  turn in  my lord  turn in to me  fear not  and when he had turn in unto her into the tent  she cover him with a mantl  4  19 and he said unto her  give me  i pray thee  a littl water to drink  for i am thirsti  and she open a bottl of milk  and gave him drink  and cover him  4  20 again he said unto her  stand in the door of the tent  and it shall be  when ani man doth come and enquir of thee  and say  is there ani man here  that thou shalt say  no  4  21 then jael heber  s wife took a nail of the tent  and took an hammer in her hand  and went soft unto him  and smote the nail into his templ  and fasten it into the ground  for he was fast asleep and weari  so he die  4  22 and  behold  as barak pursu sisera  jael came out to meet him  and said unto him  come  and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest  and when he came into her tent  behold  sisera lay dead  and the nail was in his templ  4  23 so god subdu on that day jabin the king of canaan befor the children of israel  4  24 and the hand of the children of israel prosper  and prevail against jabin the king of canaan  until they had destroy jabin king of canaan  5  1 then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day  say  5  2 prais

them that take the spoil  5  31 so let all thine enemi perish  o lord  but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might  and the land had rest forti year  6  1 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord  and the lord deliv them into the hand of midian seven year  6  2 and the hand of midian prevail against israel  and becaus of the midianit the children of israel made them the den which are in the mountain  and cave  and strong hold  6  3 and so it was  when israel had sown  that the midianit came up  and the amalekit  and the children of the east  even they came up against them  6  4 and they encamp against them  and destroy the increas of the earth  till thou come unto gaza  and left no susten for israel  neither sheep  nor ox  nor ass  6  5 for they came up with their cattl and their tent  and they came as grasshopp for multitud  for both they and their camel were without number  and they enter into the land to destroy it  6  6 and israel was great impoverish becaus of the midianit  and the children of israel cri unto the lord  6  7 and it came to pass  when the children of israel cri unto the lord becaus of the midianit  6  8 that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel  which said unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel  i brought you up from egypt  and brought you forth out of the hous of bondag  6  9 and i deliv you out of the hand of the egyptian  and out of the hand of all that oppress you  and drave them out from befor you  and gave you their land  6  10 and i said unto you  i am the lord your god  fear not the god of the amorit  in whose land ye dwell  but ye have not obey my voic  6  11 and there came an angel of the lord  and sat under an oak which was in ophrah  that pertain unto joash the abiezrit  and his son gideon thresh wheat by the winepress  to hide it from the midianit  6  12 and the angel of the lord appear unto him  and said unto him  the lord is with thee  thou mighti man of valour  6  13 and gideon said unto him  oh my lord  if the lord be with us  whi then is all this befallen us  and where be all his miracl which our father told us of  say  did not the lord bring us up from egypt  but now the lord hath forsaken us  and deliv us into the hand of the midianit  6  14 and the lord look upon him  and said  go in this thi might  and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianit  have not i sent thee  6  15 and he said unto him  oh my lord  wherewith shall i save israel  behold  my famili is poor in manasseh  and i am the least in my father  s hous  6  16 and the lord said unto him  sure i will be with thee  and thou shalt smite the midianit as one man  6  17 and he said unto him  if now i have found grace in thi sight  then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me  6  18 depart not henc  i pray thee  until i come unto thee  and bring forth my present  and set it befor thee  and he said  i will tarri until thou come again  6  19 and gideon went in  and made readi a kid  and unleaven cake of an ephah of flour  the flesh he put in a basket  and he put the broth in a pot  and brought it out unto him under the oak  and present it  6  20 and the angel of god said unto him  take the flesh and the unleaven cake  and lay them upon this rock  and pour out the broth  and he did so  6  21 then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand  and touch the flesh and the unleaven cake  and there rose up fire out of the rock  and consum the flesh and the unleaven cake  then the angel of the lord depart out of his sight  6  22 and when gideon perceiv that he was an angel of the lord  gideon said  ala  o lord god  for becaus i have seen an angel of the lord face to face  6  23 and the lord said unto him  peac be unto thee  fear not  thou shalt not die  6  24 then gideon built an altar there unto the lord  and call it jehovahshalom  unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrit  6  25 and it came to pass the same night  that the lord said unto him  take thi father  s young bullock  even the second bullock of seven year old  and throw down the altar of baal that thi father hath  and cut down the grove that is by it  6  26 and build an altar unto the lord thi god upon the top of this rock  in the order place  and take the second bullock  and offer a burnt sacrific with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down  6  27 then gideon took ten men of his servant  and did as the lord had said unto him  and so it was  becaus he fear his father  s household  and the men of the citi  that he could not do it by day  that he did it by night  6  28 and when the men of the citi aros earli in the morn  behold  the altar of baal was cast down  and the grove was cut down that was by it  and the second bullock was offer upon the altar that was built  6  29 and they said one to anoth  who hath done this thing  and when they enquir and ask  they said  gideon the son of joash hath done this thing  6  30 then the men of the citi said unto joash  bring out thi son  that he may die  becaus he hath cast down the altar of baal  and becaus he hath cut down the grove that was by it  6  31 and joash said unto all that stood against him  will ye plead for baal  will ye save him  he that will plead for him  let him be put to death whilst it is yet morn  if he be a god  let him plead for himself  becaus one hath cast down his altar  6  32 therefor on that day he call him jerubba  say  let baal plead against him  becaus he hath thrown down his altar  6  33 then all the midianit and the amalekit and the children of the east were gather togeth  and went over  and pitch in the valley of jezreel  6  34 but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon  and he blew a trumpet  and abiez was gather after him  6  35 and he sent messeng throughout all manasseh  who also was gather after him  and he sent messeng unto asher  and unto zebulun  and unto naphtali  and they came up to meet them  6  36 and gideon said unto god  if thou wilt save israel by mine hand  as thou hast said  6  37 behold  i will put a fleec of wool in the floor  and if the dew be on the fleec onli  and it be dri upon all the earth besid  then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand  as thou hast said  6  38 and it was so  for he rose up earli on the morrow  and thrust the fleec togeth  and wring the dew out of the fleec  a bowl full of water  6  39 and gideon said unto god  let not thine anger be hot against me  and i will speak but this onc  let me prove  i pray thee  but this onc with the fleec  let it now be dri onli upon the fleec  and upon all the ground let there be dew  6  40 and god did so that night  for it was dri upon the fleec onli  and there was dew on all the ground  7  1 then jerubba  who is gideon  and all the peopl that were with him  rose up earli  and pitch besid the well of harod  so that the host of the midianit were on the north side of them  by the hill of moreh  in the valley  7  2 and the lord said unto gideon  the peopl that are with thee are too mani for me to give the midianit into their hand  lest israel vaunt themselv against me  say  mine own hand hath save me  7  3 now therefor go to  proclaim in the ear of the peopl  say  whosoev is fear and afraid  let him return and depart earli from mount gilead  and there return of the peopl twenti and two thousand  and there remain ten thousand  7  4 and the lord said unto gideon  the peopl are yet too mani  bring them down unto the water  and i will tri them for thee there  and it shall be  that of whom i say unto thee  this shall go with thee  the same shall go with thee  and of whomsoev i say unto thee  this shall not go with thee  the same shall not go  7  5 so he brought down the peopl unto the water  and the lord said unto gideon  everi one that lappeth of the water with his tongu  as a dog lappeth  him shalt thou set by himself  likewis everi one that boweth down upon his knee to drink  7  6 and the number of them that lap  put their hand to their mouth  were three hundr men  but all the rest of the peopl bow down upon their knee to drink water  7  7 and the lord said unto gideon  by the three hundr men that lap will i save you  and deliv the midianit into thine hand  and let all the other peopl go everi man unto his place  7  8 so the peopl took victual in their hand  and their trumpet  and he sent all the rest of israel everi man unto his tent  and retain those three hundr men  and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley  7  9 and it came to pass the same night  that the lord said unto him  aris  get thee down unto the host  for i have deliv it into thine hand  7  10 but if thou fear to go down  go thou with phurah thi servant down to the host  7  11 and thou shalt hear what they say  and afterward shall thine hand be strengthen to go down unto the host  then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outsid of the arm men that were in the host  7  12 and the midianit and the amalekit and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshopp for multitud  and their camel were without number  as the sand by the sea side for multitud  7  13 and when gideon was come  behold  there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow  and said  behold  i dream a dream  and  lo  a cake of barley bread tumbl into the host of midian  and came unto a tent  and smote it that it fell  and overturn it  that the tent lay along  7  14 and his fellow answer and said  this is noth els save the sword of gideon the son of joash  a man of israel  for into his hand hath god deliv midian  and all the host  7  15 and it was so  when gideon heard the tell of the dream  and the interpret thereof  that he worship  and return into the host of israel  and said  aris  for the lord hath deliv into your hand the host of midian  7  16 and he divid the three hundr men into three compani  and he put a trumpet in everi man  s hand  with empti pitcher  and lamp within the pitcher  7  17 and he said unto them  look on me  and do likewis  and  behold  when i come to the outsid of the camp  it shall be that  as i do  so shall ye do  7  18 when i blow with a trumpet  i and all that are with me  then blow ye the trumpet also on everi side of all the camp  and say  the sword of the lord  and of gideon  7  19 so gideon  and the hundr men that were with him

his brother  9  22 when abimelech had reign three year over israel  9  23 then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem  and the men of shechem dealt treacher with abimelech  9  24 that the cruelti done to the threescor and ten son of jerubba might come  and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother  which slew them  and upon the men of shechem  which aid him in the

 9  40 and abimelech chase him  and he fled befor him  and mani were overthrown and wound  even unto the enter of the gate  9  41 and abimelech dwelt at arumah  and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren  that they should not dwell in shechem  9  42 and it came to pass on the morrow  that the peopl went out into the field  and they told abimelech  9  43 and he took the peopl  and divid them into three compani  and laid wait in the field  and look  and  behold  the peopl were come forth out of the citi  and he rose up against them  and smote them  9  44 and abimelech  and the compani that

ye have seen me do  make hast  and do as i have done  9  49 and all the peopl likewis cut down everi man his bough  and follow abimelech  and put them to the hold  and set the hold on fire upon them  so that all the men of the tower of shechem die also  about a thousand men and women  9  50 then went abimelech to thebez  and encamp against thebez  and took it  9  51 but there was a strong tower within the citi  and thither fled all the men and women  and all they of the citi  and shut it to them  and gat them up to the top of the tower  9  52 and abimelech came unto the tower  and fought

the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead  they depart everi man unto his place  9  56 thus god render the wicked of abimelech  which he did unto his father  in slay his seventi brethren  9  57 and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their head  and upon them came the curs of jotham the son of jerubba  10  1 and after abimelech there aros to defend israel tola the son of

and the god of moab  and the god of the children of ammon  and the god of the philistin  and forsook the lord  and serv not him  10  7 and the anger of the lord was hot against israel  and he sold

onli  we pray thee  this day  10  16 and they put away the strang god from among them  and serv the lord  and his soul was griev for the miseri of israel  10  17 then the children of ammon were gather togeth  and encamp in gilead  and the children of israel assembl themselv togeth  and encamp in mizpeh  10  18 and the peopl and princ of gilead said one to anoth  what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon  he shall be head over all the inhabit of gilead  11  1 now jephthah the gileadit was a mighti man of valour  and he was the son of an harlot  and gilead begat jephthah  11  2 and gilead  s wife bare him son  and his wife  s son grew up  and they thrust out jephthah  and said unto him  thou shalt not inherit in our father  s hous  for thou art the son of a strang woman  11  3 then jephthah fled from his brethren  and dwelt in the land of tob  and there were gather vain men to jephthah  and went out with him  11  4 and it came to pass in process of time  that the children of ammon made war against israel  11  5 and it was so  that when the children of ammon made war against israel  the elder of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob  11  6 and they said unto jephthah  come  and be our captain  that we may fight with the children of ammon  11  7 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead  did not ye hate me  and expel me out of my father  s hous  and whi are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress  11  8 and the elder of gilead said unto jephthah  therefor we turn again to thee now  that thou mayest go with us  and fight against the children of ammon  and be our head over all the inhabit of gilead  11  9 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead  if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon  and the lord deliv them befor me  shall i be your head  11  10 and the elder of gilead said unto jephthah  the lord be wit between us  if we do not so accord to thi word  11  11 then jephthah went with the elder of gilead  and the peopl made him head and captain over them  and jephthah utter all his word befor the lord in mizpeh  11  12 and jephthah sent messeng unto the king of the children of ammon  say  what hast thou to do with me  that thou art come against me to fight in my land  11  13 and the king of the children of ammon answer unto the messeng of jephthah  becaus israel took away my land  when they came up out of egypt  from arnon even unto jabbok  and unto jordan  now therefor restor those land again peaceabl  11  14 and jephthah sent messeng again unto the king of the children of ammon  11  15 and said unto him  thus saith jephthah  israel took not away the land of moab  nor the land of the children of ammon  11  16 but when israel came up from egypt  and walk through the wilder unto the red sea  and came to kadesh  11  17 then israel sent messeng unto the king of edom  say  let me  i pray thee  pass through thi land  but the king of edom would not hearken thereto  and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab  but he would not consent  and israel abod in kadesh  11  18 then they went along through the wilder  and compass the land of edom  and the land of moab  and came by the east side of the land of moab  and pitch on the other side of arnon  but came not within the border of moab  for arnon was the border of moab  11  19 and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit  the king of heshbon  and israel said unto him  let us pass  we pray thee  through thi land into my place  11  20 but sihon trust not israel to pass through his coast  but sihon gather all his peopl togeth  and pitch in jahaz  and fought against israel  11  21 and the lord god of israel deliv sihon and all his peopl into the hand of israel  and they smote them  so israel possess all the land of the amorit  the inhabit of that countri  11  22 and they possess all the coast of the amorit  from arnon even unto jabbok  and from the wilder even unto jordan  11  23 so now the lord god of israel hath dispossess the amorit from befor his peopl israel  and shouldest thou possess it  11  24 wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thi god giveth thee to possess  so whomsoev the lord our god shall drive out from befor us  them will we possess  11  25 and now art thou ani thing better than balak the son of zippor  king of moab  did he ever strive against israel  or did he ever fight against them  11  26 while israel dwelt in heshbon and her town  and in aroer and her town  and in all the citi that be along by the coast of arnon  three hundr year  whi therefor did ye not recov them within that time  11  27 wherefor i have not sin against thee  but thou doest me wrong to war against me  the lord the judg be judg this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon  11  28 howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearken not unto the word of jephthah which he sent him  11  29 then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah  and he pass over gilead  and manasseh  and pass over mizpeh of gilead  and from mizpeh of gilead he pass over unto the children of ammon  11  30 and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord  and said  if thou shalt without fail deliv the children of ammon into mine hand  11  31 then it shall be  that whatsoev cometh forth of the door of my hous to meet me  when i return in peac from the children of ammon  shall sure be the lord  s  and i will offer it up for a burnt offer  11  32 so jephthah pass over unto the children of ammon to fight against them  and the lord deliv them into his hand  11  33 and he smote them from aroer  even till thou come to minnith  even twenti citi  and unto the plain of the vineyard  with a veri great slaughter  thus the children of ammon were subdu befor the children of israel  11  34 and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his hous  and  behold  his daughter came out to meet him with timbrel and with danc  and she was his onli child  besid her he had neither son nor daughter  11  35 and it came to pass  when he saw her  that he rent his cloth  and said  ala  my daughter  thou hast brought me veri low  and thou art one of them that troubl me  for i have open my mouth unto the lord  and i cannot go back  11  36 and she said unto him  my father  if thou hast open thi mouth unto the lord  do to me accord to that which hath proceed out of thi mouth  forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeanc for thee of thine enemi  even of the children of ammon  11  37 and she said unto her father  let this thing be done for me  let me alon two month  that i may go up and down upon the mountain  and bewail my virgin  i and my fellow  11  38 and he said  go  and he sent her away for two month  and she went with her companion  and bewail her virgin upon the mountain  11  39 and it came to pass at the end of two month  that she return unto her father  who did with her accord to his vow which he had vow  and she knew no man  and it was a custom in israel  11  40 that the daughter of israel went year to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadit four day in a year  12  1 and the men of ephraim gather themselv togeth  and went northward  and said unto jephthah  wherefor passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon  and didst not call us to go with thee  we will burn thine hous upon thee with fire  12  2 and jephthah said unto them  i and my peopl were at great strife with the children of ammon  and when i call you  ye deliv me not out of their hand  12  3 and when i saw that ye deliv me not  i put my life in my hand  and pass over against the children of ammon  and the lord deliv them into my hand  wherefor then are ye come up unto me this day  to fight against me  12  4 then jephthah gather togeth all the men of gilead  and fought with ephraim  and the men of gilead smote ephraim  becaus they said  ye gileadit are fugit of ephraim among the ephraimit  and among the manassit  12  5 and the gileadit took the passag of jordan befor the ephraimit  and it was so  that when those ephraimit which were escap said  let me go over  that the men of gilead said unto him  art thou an ephraimit  if he said  nay  12  6 then said they unto him  say now shibboleth  and he said sibboleth  for he could not frame to pronounc it right  then they took him  and slew him at the passag of jordan  and there fell at that time of the ephraimit forti and two thousand  12  7 and jephthah judg israel six year  then die jephthah the gileadit  and was buri in one of the citi of gilead  12  8 and after him ibzan of bethlehem judg israel

and he shall begin to deliv israel out of the hand of the philistin  13  6 then the woman came and told her husband  say  a man of god came unto me  and his counten was like the counten of an angel of

 but manoah her husband was not with her  13  10 and the woman made hast  and ran  and shew her husband  and said unto him  behold  the man hath appear unto me  that came unto me the other day  13  11 and manoah aros  and went after his wife  and came to the man  and said unto him  art thou the man that spakest unto the woman  and he said  i am  13  12 and manoah said  now let thi word come to pass  how shall we order the child  and how shall we do unto him  13  13 and the angel of the lord said unto manoah  of all that i said unto the woman let her bewar  13  14 she may not eat of ani thing that cometh of the vine  neither let her drink wine or strong drink  nor eat ani unclean thing  all that i command her let her observ  13  15 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord  i pray thee  let us detain thee  until we shall have made readi a kid for thee  13  16 and the angel of the lord said unto manoah  though thou detain me  i will not eat of thi bread  and if thou wilt offer a burnt offer  thou must offer it unto the lord  for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord  13  17 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord  what is thi name  that when thi say come to pass we may do thee honour  13  18 and the angel of the lord said unto him  whi askest thou thus after my name  see it is secret  13  19 so manoah took a kid with a meat offer  and offer it upon a rock unto the lord  and the angel did wonder  and manoah and his wife look on  13  20 for it came to pass  when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar  that the angel of the lord ascend in the flame of the altar  and manoah and his wife look on it  and fell on their face to the ground  13  21 but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife  then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord  13  22 and manoah said unto his wife  we shall sure die  becaus we have seen god  13  23 but his wife said unto him  if the lord were pleas to kill us  he would not have receiv a burnt offer and a meat offer at our hand  neither would he have shew us all these thing  nor would as at this time have told us such thing as these  13  24 and the woman bare a son  and call his name samson  and the child grew  and the lord bless him  13  25 and the spirit of the lord began to move him at time in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol  14  1 and samson went down to timnath  and

 3  19 and samuel grew  and the lord was with him  and did let none of his word fall to the ground  3  20 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was establish to be a prophet of

befor the philistin  and they slew of the armi in the field about four thousand men  4  3 and when the peopl were come into the camp  the elder of israel said  wherefor hath the lord smitten us to day befor the philistin  let us fetch the ark of the coven of the lord out of shiloh unto us  that  when it cometh among us  it may save us out of the hand of our enemi  4  4 so the peopl sent to shiloh  that they might bring from thenc the ark of the coven of the lord of host  which dwelleth between the cherubim  and the two son of eli  hophni and phineha  were there with the ark of the coven of god  4  5 and when the ark of the coven of the lord came into the camp  all israel shout with a great shout  so that the earth rang again  4  6 and when the philistin heard the nois of the shout  they said  what meaneth the nois of this great shout in the camp of the hebrew  and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp  4  7 and the philistin were afraid  for they said  god is

the ark of god was taken  and the two son of eli  hophni and phineha  were slain  4  12 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the armi  and came to shiloh the same day with his cloth rent  and with earth upon his head  4  13 and when he came  lo  eli sat upon a seat by the waysid watch  for his heart trembl for the ark of god  and when the man came into the citi  and told it  all the citi cri

were dim  that he could not see  4  16 and the man said unto eli  i am he that came out of the armi  and i fled to day out of the armi  and he said  what is there done  my son  4  17 and the messeng answer and said  israel is fled befor the philistin  and there hath been also a great slaughter among the peopl  and thi two son also  hophni and phineha  are dead  and the ark of god is taken  4  18 and it came to pass  when he made mention of the ark of god  that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate  and his neck brake  and he die  for he was an old man  and heavi  and he had judg israel forti year  4  19 and his daughter in law  phineha  wife  was with child  near to be deliv  and when she heard the tide that the ark of god was taken  and that her father in law and her husband were dead  she bow herself and travail  for her pain came upon her  4  20 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her  fear not  for thou hast born a son  but

4  22 and she said  the glori is depart from israel  for the ark of god is taken  5  1 and the philistin took the ark of god  and brought it from ebenez unto ashdod  5  2 when the philistin took the ark of god  they brought it into the hous of dagon  and set it by dagon  5  3 and when they of ashdod aros earli on the morrow  behold  dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth befor the ark of the

 5  7 and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so  they said  the ark of the god of israel shall not abid with us  for his hand is sore upon us  and upon dagon our god  5  8 they sent therefor and gather all the lord of the philistin unto them  and said  what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel  and they answer  let the ark of the god of israel be carri about unto gath  and they carri

make imag of your emerod  and imag of your mice that mar the land  and ye shall give glori unto the god of israel  peradventur he will lighten his hand from off you  and from off your god  and from off your land  6  6 wherefor then do ye harden your heart  as the egyptian and pharaoh harden their heart  when he had wrought wonder among them  did they not let the peopl go  and they depart  6  7 now therefor make a new cart  and take two milch kine  on which there hath come no yoke  and tie the kine to the cart  and bring their calv home from them  6  8 and take the ark of the lord  and lay it upon the cart  and put the jewel of gold  which ye return him for a trespass offer  in a coffer by the side thereof  and send it away  that it may go  6  9 and see  if it goeth up by the way of his

took two milch kine  and tie them to the cart  and shut up their calv at home  6  11 and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart  and the coffer with the mice of gold and the imag of their emerod  6  12 and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh  and went along the highway  low as they went  and turn not asid to the right hand or to the left  and the lord of the philistin went after them unto the border of bethshemesh  6  13 and they of bethshemesh were reap their wheat harvest in the valley  and they lift up their eye  and saw the ark  and rejoic to see it  6  14 and the cart came into the field of joshua  a bethshemit  and stood there  where there was a great stone  and they clave the wood of the cart  and offer the kine a burnt offer unto the lord  6  15 and the levit took down the ark of the lord  and the coffer that was with it  wherein the jewel of gold were  and put them on the great stone  and the men of bethshemesh offer burnt offer and sacrif sacrific the same day unto the lord  6  16 and when the five lord of the philistin had seen it  they return to ekron the same day  6  17 and these are the golden emerod which the philistin return for a trespass offer unto the lord  for ashdod one  for gaza one  for askelon one  for gath one  for ekron one  6  18 and the golden mice  accord to the number of all the citi of the philistin belong to the five lord  both of fenc citi  and of countri villag  even unto the great stone of abel  whereon they set down the ark of the lord  which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua  the

the lord had smitten mani of the peopl with a great slaughter  6  20 and the men of bethshemesh said  who is abl to stand befor this holi lord god  and to whom shall he go up from us  6  21 and they sent messeng to the inhabit of kirjathjearim  say  the philistin have brought again the ark of the lord  come ye down  and fetch it up to you  7  1 and the men of kirjathjearim came  and fetch up the ark of the lord  and brought it into the hous of abinadab in the hill  and sanctifi eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord  7  2 and it came to pass  while the ark abod in kirjathjearim  that the

put away the strang god and ashtaroth from among you  and prepar your heart unto the lord  and serv him onli  and he will deliv you out of the hand of the philistin  7  4 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth  and serv the lord onli  7  5 and samuel said  gather all israel to mizpeh  and i will pray for you unto the lord  7  6 and they gather togeth to mizpeh  and drew water  and pour it out befor the lord  and fast on that day  and said there  we have sin against the lord  and samuel judg the children of israel in mizpeh  7  7 and when the philistin heard that the children of israel were gather togeth to mizpeh  the lord of the philistin went up against israel  and when the children of israel heard it  they were afraid of the philistin  7  8 and the children of israel said to samuel  ceas not to cri unto the lord our god for us  that he will save us out of the hand of the philistin  7  9 and samuel took a suck lamb  and offer it for a burnt offer wholli unto the lord  and samuel cri unto the lord for israel  and the lord heard him  7  10 and as samuel was offer up the burnt offer  the philistin drew near to battl against israel  but the lord thunder with a great thunder on that day upon the philistin  and discomfit them  and they were smitten befor israel  7  11 and the men of israel went out of mizpeh  and pursu the philistin  and smote them  until they came under bethcar  7  12 then samuel took a stone  and set it between mizpeh and shen  and call the name of it ebenez  say  hitherto hath the lord help us  7  13 so the philistin were subdu  and they came no more into the coast of israel  and the hand of the lord was against the philistin all the day of samuel  7  14 and the citi which the philistin had taken from israel were restor to israel  from ekron even unto gath  and the coast thereof did israel deliv out of the hand of the philistin  and there was peac between israel and the amorit  7  15 and samuel judg israel all the day of his life  7  16 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel  and gilgal  and mizpeh  and judg israel in all those place  7  17 and his return was to ramah  for there was his hous  and there he judg israel  and there he built an altar unto the lord  8  1 and it came to pass  when samuel was old  that he made his son judg over israel  8  2 now the name of his firstborn was joel  and the name of

samuel  when they said  give us a king to judg us  and samuel pray unto the lord  8  7 and the lord said unto samuel  hearken unto the voic of the peopl in all that they say unto thee  for they have

wherewith they have forsaken me  and serv other god  so do they also unto thee  8  9 now therefor hearken unto their voic  howbeit yet protest solemn unto them  and shew them the manner of the king

that were bidden  which were about thirti person  9  23 and samuel said unto the cook  bring the portion which i gave thee  of which i said unto thee  set it by thee  9  24 and the cook took up the

and thou shalt go down befor me to gilgal  and  behold  i will come down unto thee  to offer burnt offer  and to sacrific sacrific of peac offer  seven day shalt thou tarri  till i come to thee  and shew thee what thou shalt do  10  9 and it was so  that when he had turn his back to go from samuel  god gave him anoth heart  and all those sign came to pass that day  10  10 and when they came thither to the hill  behold  a compani of prophet met him  and the spirit of god came upon him  and he prophesi among them  10  11 and it came to pass  when all that knew him beforetim saw that  behold  he prophesi among the prophet  then the peopl said one to anoth  what is this that is come unto the son of kish  is saul also among the prophet  10  12 and one of the same place answer and said  but who is their father  therefor it becam a proverb  is saul also among the prophet  10  13 and when he had made an end of prophesi  he came to the high place  10  14 and saul  s uncl said unto him and to his servant  whither went ye  and he said  to seek the ass  and when we saw that they were no where  we came to samuel  10  15 and saul  s uncl said  tell me  i pray thee  what samuel said unto you  10  16 and saul said unto his uncl  he told us plain that the ass were found  but of the matter of the kingdom  whereof samuel spake  he told him not  10  17 and samuel call the peopl togeth unto the lord to mizpeh  10  18 and said unto the children of israel  thus saith the lord god of israel  i brought up israel out of egypt  and deliv you out of the hand of the egyptian  and out of the hand of all kingdom  and of them that oppress you  10  19 and ye have this day reject your god  who himself save you out of all your advers and your tribul  and ye have said unto him  nay  but set a king over us  now therefor present yourselv befor the lord by your tribe  and by your thousand  10  20 and when samuel had caus all the tribe of israel to come near  the tribe of benjamin was taken  10  21 when he had caus the tribe of benjamin to come near by their famili  the famili of matri was taken  and saul the son of kish was taken  and when they sought him  he could not be found  10  22 therefor they enquir of the lord further  if the man should yet come thither  and the lord answer  behold he hath hid himself among the stuff  10  23 and they ran and fetch him thenc  and when he stood among the peopl  he was higher than ani of the peopl from his shoulder and upward  10  24 and samuel said to all the peopl  see ye him whom the lord hath chosen  that there is none like him among all the peopl  and all the peopl shout  and said  god save the king  10  25 then samuel told the peopl the manner of the kingdom  and wrote it in a book  and laid it up befor the lord  and samuel sent all the peopl away  everi man to his hous  10  26 and saul also went home to gibeah  and there went with him a band of men  whose heart god had touch  10  27 but the children of belial said  how shall this man save us  and they despis him  and brought no present  but he held his peac  11  1 then nahash the ammonit came up  and encamp against jabeshgilead  and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash  make a coven with us  and we will serv thee  11  2 and nahash the ammonit answer them  on this condit will i make a coven with you  that i may thrust out all your right eye  and lay it for a reproach upon all israel  11  3 and the elder of jabesh said unto him  give us seven day  respit  that we may send messeng unto all the coast of israel  and then  if there be no man to save us  we will come out to thee  11  4 then came the messeng to gibeah of saul  and told the tide in the ear of the peopl  and all the peopl lift up their voic  and wept  11  5 and  behold  saul came after the herd out of the field  and saul said  what aileth the peopl that they weep  and they told him the tide of the men of jabesh  11  6 and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tide  and his anger was kindl great  11  7 and he took a yoke of oxen  and hew them in piec  and sent them throughout all the coast of israel by the hand of messeng  say  whosoev cometh not forth after saul and after samuel  so shall it be done unto his oxen  and the fear of the lord fell on the peopl  and they came out with one consent  11  8 and when he number them in bezek  the children of israel were three hundr thousand  and the men of judah thirti thousand  11  9 and they said unto the messeng that came  thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead  to morrow  by that time the sun be hot  ye shall have help  and the messeng came and shew it to the men of jabesh  and they were glad  11  10 therefor the men of jabesh said  to morrow we will come out unto you  and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you  11  11 and it was so on the morrow  that saul put the peopl in three compani  and they came into the midst of the host in the morn watch  and slew the ammonit until the heat of the day  and it came to pass  that they which remain were scatter  so that two of them were not left togeth  11  12 and the peopl said unto samuel  who is he that said  shall saul reign over us  bring the men  that we may put them to death  11  13 and saul said  there shall not a man be put to death this day  for to day the lord hath wrought salvat in israel  11  14 then said samuel to the peopl  come  and let us go to gilgal  and renew the kingdom there  11  15 and all the peopl went to gilgal  and there they made saul king befor the lord in gilgal  and there they sacrif sacrific of peac offer befor the lord  and there saul and all the men of israel rejoic great  12  1 and samuel said unto all israel  behold  i have hearken unto your voic in all that ye said unto me  and have made a king over you  12  2 and now  behold  the king walketh befor you  and i am old and grayhead  and  behold  my son are with you  and i have walk befor you from my childhood unto this day  12  3 behold  here i am  wit against me befor the lord  and befor his anoint  whose ox have i taken  or whose ass have i taken  or whom have i defraud  whom have i oppress  or of whose hand have i receiv ani bribe to blind mine eye therewith  and i will restor it you  12  4 and they said  thou hast not defraud us  nor oppress us  neither hast thou taken ought of ani man  s hand  12  5 and he said unto them  the lord is wit against you  and his anoint is wit this day  that ye have not found ought in my hand  and they answer  he is wit  12  6 and samuel said unto the peopl  it is the lord that advanc mose and aaron  and that brought your father up out of the land of egypt  12  7 now therefor stand still  that i may reason with you befor the lord of all the righteous act of the lord  which he did to you and to your father  12  8 when jacob was come into egypt  and your father cri unto the lord  then the lord sent mose and aaron  which brought forth your father out of egypt  and made them dwell in this place  12  9 and when they forgat the lord their god  he sold them into the hand of sisera  captain of the host of hazor  and into the hand of the philistin  and into the hand of the king of moab  and they fought against them  12  10 and they cri unto the lord  and said  we have sin  becaus we have forsaken the lord  and have serv baalim and ashtaroth  but now deliv us out of the hand of our enemi  and we will serv thee  12  11 and the lord sent jerubba  and bedan  and jephthah  and samuel  and deliv you out of the hand of your enemi on everi side  and ye dwell safe  12  12 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you  ye said unto me  nay  but a king shall reign over us  when the lord your god was your king  12  13 now therefor behold the king whom ye have chosen  and whom ye have desir  and  behold  the lord hath set a king over you  12  14 if ye will fear the lord  and serv him  and obey his voic  and not rebel against the command of the lord  then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continu follow the lord your god  12  15 but if ye will not obey the voic of the lord  but rebel against the command of the lord  then shall the hand of the lord be against you  as it was against your father  12  16 now therefor stand and see this great thing  which the lord will do befor your eye  12  17 is it not wheat harvest to day  i will call unto the lord  and he shall send thunder and rain  that ye may perceiv and see that your wicked is great  which ye have done in the sight of the lord  in ask you a king  12  18 so samuel call unto the lord  and the lord sent thunder and rain that day  and all the peopl great fear the lord and samuel  12  19 and all the peopl said unto samuel  pray for thi servant unto the lord thi god  that we die not  for we have ad unto all our sin this evil  to ask us a king  12  20 and samuel said unto the peopl  fear not  ye have done all this wicked  yet turn not asid from follow the lord  but serv the lord with all your heart  12  21 and turn ye not asid  for then should ye go after vain thing  which cannot profit nor deliv  for they are vain  12  22 for the lord will not forsak his peopl for his great name  s sake  becaus it hath pleas the lord to make you his peopl  12  23 moreov as for me  god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceas to pray for you  but i will teach you the good and the right way  12  24 onli fear the lord  and serv him in truth with all your heart  for consid how great thing he hath done for you  12  25 but if ye shall still do wick  ye shall be consum  both ye and your king  13  1 saul reign one year  and when he had reign two year over israel  13  2 saul chose him three thousand men of israel  whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel  and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin  and the rest of the peopl he sent everi man to his tent  13  3 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistin that was in geba  and the philistin heard of it  and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land  say  let the hebrew hear  13  4 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistin  and that israel also was had in abomin with the philistin  and the peopl were call togeth after saul to gilgal  13  5 and the philistin gather themselv togeth to fight with israel  thirti thousand chariot  and six thousand horsemen  and peopl as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitud  and they came up  and pitch in michmash  eastward from bethaven  13  6 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait   for the peopl were distress  then the peopl did hide themselv in cave  and in thicket  and in rock  and in high place  and in pit  13  7 and some of the hebrew went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead  as for saul  he was yet in gilgal  and all the peopl follow him trembl  13  8 and he tarri seven day  accord to the set time that samuel had appoint  but samuel came not to gilgal  and the peopl were scatter from him  13  9 and saul said  bring hither a burnt offer to me  and peac offer  and he offer the burnt offer  13  10 and it came to pass  that as soon as he had made an end of offer the burnt offer  behold  samuel came  and saul went out to meet him  that he might salut him  13  11 and samuel said  what hast thou done  and saul said  becaus i saw that the peopl were scatter from me  and that thou camest not within the day appoint  and that the philistin gather themselv togeth at michmash  13  12 therefor said i  the philistin will come down now upon me to gilgal  and i have not made supplic unto the lord  i forc myself therefor  and offer a burnt offer  13  13 and samuel said to saul  thou hast done foolish  thou hast not kept the command of the lord thi god  which he command thee  for now would the lord have establish thi kingdom upon israel for ever  13  14 but now thi kingdom shall not continu  the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart  and the lord hath command him to be captain over his peopl  becaus thou hast not kept that which the lord command thee  13  15 and samuel aros  and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin  and saul number the peopl that were present with him  about six hundr men  13  16 and saul  and jonathan his son  and the peopl that were present with them  abod in gibeah of benjamin  but the philistin encamp in michmash  13  17 and the spoiler came out of the camp of the philistin in three compani  one compani turn unto the way that leadeth to ophrah  unto the land of shual  13  18 and anoth compani turn the way to bethhoron  and anoth compani turn to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilder  13  19 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel  for the philistin said  lest the hebrew make them sword or spear  13  20 but all the israelit went down to the philistin  to sharpen everi man his share  and his coulter  and his axe  and his mattock  13  21 yet they had a file for the mattock  and for the coulter  and for the fork  and for the axe  and to sharpen the goad  13  22 so it came to pass in the day of battl  that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of ani of the peopl that were with saul and jonathan  but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found  13  23 and the garrison of the philistin went out to the passag of michmash  14  1 now it came to pass upon a day  that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour  come  and let us go over to the philistin  garrison  that is on the other side  but he told not his father  14  2 and saul tarri in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegran tree which is in migron  and the peopl that were with him were about six hundr men  14  3 and ahiah  the son of ahitub  ichabod  s brother  the son of phineha  the son of eli  the lord  s priest in shiloh  wear an ephod  and the peopl knew not that jonathan was gone  14  4 and between the passag  by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistin  garrison  there was a sharp rock on the one side  and a sharp rock on the other side  and the name of the one was bozez  and the name of the other seneh  14  5 the forefront of the one was situat northward over against michmash  and the other southward over against gibeah  14  6 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour  come  and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcis  it may be that the lord will work for us  for there is no restraint to the lord to save by mani or by few  14  7 and his armourbear said unto him  do all that is in thine heart  turn thee  behold  i am with thee accord to thi heart  14  8 then said jonathan  behold  we will pass over unto these men  and we will discov ourselv unto them  14  9 if they say thus unto us  tarri until we come to you  then we will stand still in our place  and will not go up unto them  14  10 but if they say thus  come up unto us  then we will go up  for the lord hath deliv them into our hand  and this shall be a sign unto us  14  11 and both of them discov themselv unto the garrison of the philistin  and the philistin said  behold  the hebrew come forth out of the hole where they had hid themselv  14  12 and the men of the garrison answer jonathan and his armourbear  and said  come up to us  and we will shew you a thing  and jonathan said unto his armourbear  come up after me  for the lord hath deliv them into the hand of israel  14  13 and jonathan climb up upon his hand and upon his feet  and his armourbear after him  and they fell befor jonathan  and his armourbear slew after him  14  14 and that first slaughter  which jonathan and his armourbear made  was about twenti men  within as it were an half acr of land  which a yoke of oxen might plow  14  15 and there was trembl in the host  in the field  and among all the peopl  the garrison  and the spoiler  they also trembl  and the earth quak  so it was a veri great trembl  14  16 and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin look  and  behold  the multitud melt away  and they went on beat down one anoth  14  17 then said saul unto the peopl that were with him  number now  and see who is gone from us  and when they had number  behold  jonathan and his armourbear were not there  14  18 and saul said unto ahiah  bring hither the ark of god  for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel  14  19 and it came to pass  while saul talk unto the priest  that the nois that was in the host of the philistin went on and increas  and saul said unto the priest  withdraw thine hand  14  20 and saul and all the peopl that were with him assembl themselv  and they came to the battl  and  behold  everi man  s sword was against his fellow  and there was a veri great discomfitur  14  21 moreov the hebrew that were with the philistin befor that time  which went up with them into the camp from the countri round about  even they also turn to be with the israelit that were with saul and jonathan  14  22 likewis all the men of israel which had hid themselv in mount ephraim  when they heard that the philistin fled  even they also follow hard after them in the battl  14  23 so the lord save israel that day  and the battl pass over unto bethaven  14  24 and the men of israel were distress that day  for saul had adjur the peopl  say  curs be the man that eateth ani food until even  that i may be aveng on mine enemi  so none of the peopl tast ani food  14  25 and all they of the land came to a wood  and there was honey upon the ground  14  26 and when the peopl were come into the wood  behold  the honey drop  but no man put his hand to his mouth  for the peopl fear the oath  14  27 but jonathan heard not when his father charg the peopl with the oath  wherefor he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand  and dip it in an honeycomb  and put his hand to his mouth  and his eye were enlighten  14  28 then answer one of the peopl  and said  thi father strait charg the peopl with an oath  say  curs be the man that eateth ani food this day  and the peopl were faint  14  29 then said jonathan  my father hath troubl the land  see  i pray you  how mine eye have been enlighten  becaus i tast a littl of this honey  14  30 how much more  if hapli the peopl had eaten freeli to day of the spoil of their enemi which they found  for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistin  14  31 and they smote the philistin that day from michmash to aijalon  and the peopl were veri faint  14  32 and the peopl flew upon the spoil  and took sheep  and oxen  and calv  and slew them on the ground  and the peopl did eat them with the blood  14  33 then they told saul  say  behold  the peopl sin against the lord  in that they eat with the blood  and he said  ye have transgress  roll a great stone unto me this day  14  34 and saul said  dispers yourselv among the peopl  and say unto them  bring me hither everi man his ox  and everi man his sheep  and slay them here  and eat  and sin not against the lord in eat with the blood  and all the peopl brought everi man his ox with him that night  and slew them there  14  35 and saul built an altar unto the lord  the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord  14  36 and saul said  let us go down after the philistin by night  and spoil them until the morn light  and let us not leav a man of them  and they said  do whatsoev seemeth good unto thee  then said the priest  let us draw near hither unto god  14  37 and saul ask counsel of god  shall i go down after the philistin  wilt thou deliv them into the hand of israel  but he answer him not that day  14  38 and saul said  draw ye near hither  all the chief of the peopl  and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day  14  39 for  as the lord liveth  which saveth israel  though it be in jonathan my son  he shall sure die  but there was not a man among all the peopl that answer him  14  40 then said he unto all israel  be ye on one side  and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side  and the peopl said unto saul  do what seemeth good unto thee  14  41 therefor saul said unto the lord god of israel  give a perfect lot  and saul and jonathan were taken  but the peopl escap  14  42 and saul said  cast lot between me and jonathan my son  and jonathan was taken  14  43 then saul said to jonathan  tell me what thou hast done  and jonathan told him  and said  i did but tast a littl honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand  and  lo  i must die  14  44 and saul answer  god do so and more also  for thou shalt sure die  jonathan  14  45 and the peopl said unto saul  shall jonathan die  who hath wrought this great salvat in israel  god forbid  as the lord liveth  there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground  for he hath wrought with god this day  so the peopl rescu jonathan  that he die not  14  46 then saul went up from follow the philistin  and the philistin went to their own place  14  47 so saul took the kingdom over israel  and fought against all his enemi on everi side  against moab  and against the children of ammon  and against edom  and against the king of zobah  and against the philistin  and whithersoev he turn himself  he vex them  14  48 and he gather an host  and smote the amalekit  and deliv israel out of the hand of them that spoil them  14  49 now the son of saul were jonathan  and ishui  and melchishua  and the name of his two daughter were these  the name of the firstborn merab  and the name of the younger michal  14  50 and the name of saul  s wife was ahinoam  the daughter of ahimaaz  and the name of the captain of his host was abner  the son of ner  saul  s uncl  14  51 and kish was the father of saul  and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel  14  52 and there was sore war against the philistin all the day of saul  and when saul saw ani strong

appear  but the lord looketh on the heart  16  8 then jess call abinadab  and made him pass befor samuel  and he said  neither hath the lord chosen this  16  9 then jess made shammah to pass by  and he said  neither hath the lord chosen this  16  10 again  jess made seven of his son to pass befor samuel  and samuel said unto jess  the lord hath not chosen these  16  11 and samuel said unto jess

in his hand  and he drew near to the philistin  17  41 and the philistin came on and drew near unto david  and the man that bare the shield went befor him  17  42 and when the philistin look about  and saw david  he disdain him  for he was but a youth  and ruddi  and of a fair counten  17  43 and the philistin said unto david  am i a dog  that thou comest to me with stave  and the philistin curs david by his god  17  44 and the philistin said to david  come to me  and i will give thi flesh unto the fowl of the air  and to the beast of the field  17  45 then said david to the philistin  thou comest to me with a sword  and with a spear  and with a shield  but i come to thee in the name of the lord of host  the god of the armi of israel  whom thou hast defi  17  46 this day will the lord deliv thee into mine hand  and i will smite thee  and take thine head from thee  and i will give the carcas of the host of the philistin this day unto the fowl of the air  and to the wild beast of the earth  that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel  17  47 and all this assembl shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear  for the battl is the lord  s  and he will give

was afraid of him  18  16 but all israel and judah love david  becaus he went out and came in befor them  18  17 and saul said to david  behold my elder daughter merab  her will i give thee to wife  onli be thou valiant for me  and fight the lord  s battl  for saul said  let not mine hand be upon him  but let the hand of the philistin be upon him  18  18 and david said unto saul  who am i  and

sacrific there for all the famili  20  7 if he say thus  it is well  thi servant shall have peac  but if he be veri wroth  then be sure that evil is determin by him  20  8 therefor thou shalt deal kind with thi servant  for thou hast brought thi servant into a coven of the lord with thee  notwithstand  if there be in me iniqu  slay me thyself  for whi shouldest thou bring me to thi father  20  9 and jonathan said  far be it from thee  for if i knew certain that evil were determin by my father to come upon thee  then would not i tell it thee  20  10 then said david to jonathan  who shall tell me  or what if thi father answer thee rough  20  11 and jonathan said unto david  come  and let us go out into the field  and they went out both of them into the field  20  12 and jonathan said unto david  o lord god of israel  when i have sound my father about to morrow ani time  or the third day  and  behold  if there be good toward david  and i then send not unto thee  and shew it thee  20  13 the lord do so and much more to jonathan  but if it pleas my father to do thee evil  then i will shew it thee  and send thee away  that thou mayest go in peac  and the lord be with thee  as he hath been with my father  20  14 and thou shalt not onli while yet i live shew me the kind of the lord  that i die not  20  15 but also thou shalt not cut off thi kind from my hous for ever  no  not when the lord hath cut off the enemi of david everi one from the face of the earth  20  16 so jonathan made a coven with the hous of david  say  let the lord even requir it at the hand of david  s enemi  20  17 and jonathan caus david to swear again  becaus he love him  for he love him as he love his own soul  20  18 then jonathan said to david  to morrow is the new moon  and thou shalt be miss  becaus thi seat will be empti  20  19 and when thou hast stay three day  then thou shalt go down quick  and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the busi was in hand  and shalt remain by the stone ezel  20  20 and i will shoot three arrow on the side thereof  as though i shot at a mark  20  21 and  behold  i will send a lad  say  go  find out the arrow  if i expressli say unto the

abner sat by saul  s side  and david  s place was empti  20  26 nevertheless saul spake not ani thing that day  for he thought  someth hath befallen him  he is not clean  sure he is not clean  20  27 and it came to pass on the morrow  which was the second day of the month  that david  s place was empti  and saul said unto jonathan his son  wherefor cometh not the son of jess to meat  neither

brother  he hath command me to be there  and now  if i have found favour in thine eye  let me get away  i pray thee  and see my brethren  therefor he cometh not unto the king  s tabl  20  30 then saul  s anger was kindl against jonathan  and he said unto him  thou son of the pervers rebelli woman  do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jess to thine own confus  and unto the confus of thi mother  s naked  20  31 for as long as the son of jess liveth upon the ground  thou shalt not be establish  nor thi kingdom  wherefor now send and fetch him unto me  for he shall sure die  20  32 and jonathan answer saul his father  and said unto him  wherefor shall he be slain  what hath he done  20  33 and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him  wherebi jonathan knew that it was determin of his father to slay david  20  34 so jonathan aros from the tabl in fierc anger  and did eat no meat the second day of the month  for he was griev for david  becaus his father had done him shame  20  35 and it came to pass in the morn  that jonathan went out into the field at the time appoint with david  and a littl lad with him  20  36 and he said unto his lad  run  find out now the arrow which i

forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord  say  the lord be between me and thee  and between my seed and thi seed for ever  and he aros and depart  and jonathan went into the citi  21  1 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest  and ahimelech was afraid at the meet of david  and said unto him  whi art thou alon  and no man with thee  21  2 and david said unto ahimelech the

22  23 abid thou with me  fear not  for he that seeketh my life seeketh thi life  but with me thou shalt be in safeguard  23  1 then they told david  say  behold  the philistin fight against keilah

for if a man find his enemi  will he let him go well away  wherefor the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day  24  20 and now  behold  i know well that thou shalt sure be king  and that the kingdom of israel shall be establish in thine hand  24  21 swear now therefor unto me by the lord  that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me  and that thou wilt not destroy my name out

be to thine hous  and peac be unto all that thou hast  25  7 and now i have heard that thou hast shearer  now thi shepherd which were with us  we hurt them not  neither was there ought miss unto them  all the while they were in carmel  25  8 ask thi young men  and they will shew thee  wherefor let the young men find favour in thine eye  for we come in a good day  give  i pray thee  whatsoev cometh

them keep the sheep  25  17 now therefor know and consid what thou wilt do  for evil is determin against our master  and against all his household  for he is such a son of belial  that a man cannot

cake of fig  and laid them on ass  25  19 and she said unto her servant  go on befor me  behold  i come after you  but she told not her husband nabal  25  20 and it was so  as she rode on the ass  that she came down by the covert on the hill  and  behold  david and his men came down against her  and she met them  25  21 now david had said  sure in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in

regard this man of belial  even nabal  for as his name is  so is he  nabal is his name  and folli is with him  but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord  whom thou didst send  25  26 now therefor  my lord  as the lord liveth  and as thi soul liveth  see the lord hath withholden thee from come to shed blood  and from aveng thyself with thine own hand  now let thine enemi  and they that seek evil to my lord  be as nabal  25  27 and now this bless which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord  let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord  25  28 i pray thee  forgiv the trespass of thine handmaid  for the lord will certain make my lord a sure hous  becaus my lord fighteth the battl of the lord  and evil hath not been found in thee all thi day  25  29 yet a man is

that this shall be no grief unto thee  nor offenc of heart unto my lord  either that thou hast shed blood causeless  or that my lord hath aveng himself  but when the lord shall have dealt well with my

kept me this day from come to shed blood  and from aveng myself with mine own hand  25  34 for in veri deed  as the lord god of israel liveth  which hath kept me back from hurt thee  except thou hadst

when david heard that nabal was dead  he said  bless be the lord  that hath plead the caus of my reproach from the hand of nabal  and hath kept his servant from evil  for the lord hath return the

david sent us unto thee  to take thee to him to wife  25  41 and she aros  and bow herself on her face to the earth  and said  behold  let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servant

 26  25 then saul said to david  bless be thou  my son david  thou shalt both do great thing  and also shalt still prevail  so david went on his way  and saul return to his place  27  1 and david said in his heart  i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul  there is noth better for me than that i should speedili escap into the land of the philistin  and saul shall despair of me  to seek me ani

david dwelt with achish at gath  he and his men  everi man with his household  even david with his two wive  ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail the carmelitess  nabal  s wife  27  4 and it was told saul that david was fled to gath  and he sought no more again for him  27  5 and david said unto achish  if i have now found grace in thine eye  let them give me a place in some town in the countri  that i may dwell there  for whi should thi servant dwell in the royal citi with thee  27  6 then achish gave him ziklag that day  wherefor ziklag pertaineth unto the king of judah unto this day  27  7 and the time that david dwelt in the countri of the philistin was a full year and four month  27  8 and david and his men went up  and invad the geshurit  and the gezrit  and the amalekit  for those nation were of old the inhabit of the land  as thou goest to shur  even unto the land of egypt  27  9 and david smote the land  and left neither man nor woman aliv  and took away the sheep  and the oxen  and the ass  and the camel  and the apparel  and return  and came to achish  27  10 and achish said  whither have ye made a road to day  and david said  against the south of judah  and against

will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the countri of the philistin  27  12 and achish believ david  say  he hath made his peopl israel utter to abhor him  therefor he shall be my servant for ever  28  1 and it came to pass in those day  that the philistin gather their armi togeth for warfar  to fight with israel  and achish said unto david  know thou assur  that thou shalt go out with me to battl  thou and thi men  28  2 and david said to achish  sure thou shalt know what thi servant can do  and achish said to david  therefor will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever  28  3 now samuel was dead  and all israel had lament him  and buri him in ramah  even in his own citi  and saul had put away those that had familiar spirit  and the wizard  out of the land  28  4 and the philistin gather themselv togeth  and came and pitch in shunem  and saul gather all israel togeth  and they pitch in gilboa  28  5 and when saul saw the host of the philistin  he was afraid  and his heart great trembl  28  6 and when saul enquir of the lord  the lord answer him not  neither by dream  nor by urim  nor by prophet  28  7 then said saul unto his servant  seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit  that i may go to her  and enquir of her  and his servant said to him  behold  there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor  28  8 and saul disguis himself  and put on other raiment  and he went  and two men with him  and they came to the woman by night  and he said  i pray thee  divin unto me by the familiar spirit  and bring me him up  whom i shall name unto thee  28  9 and the woman said unto him  behold  thou knowest what saul hath done  how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirit  and the wizard  out of the land  wherefor then layest thou a snare for my life  to caus me to die  28  10 and saul sware to her by the lord  say  as the lord liveth  there shall no punish happen to thee for this thing  28  11 then said the woman  whom shall i bring up unto

said unto her  be not afraid  for what sawest thou  and the woman said unto saul  i saw god ascend out of the earth  28  14 and he said unto her  what form is he of  and she said  an old man cometh up  and he is cover with a mantl  and saul perceiv that it was samuel  and he stoop with his face to the ground  and bow himself  28  15 and samuel said to saul  whi hast thou disquiet me  to bring me up  and saul answer  i am sore distress  for the philistin make war against me  and god is depart from me  and answereth me no more  neither by prophet  nor by dream  therefor i have call thee  that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do  28  16 then said samuel  wherefor then dost thou ask of me  see the lord is depart from thee  and is becom thine enemi  28  17 and the lord hath done to him  as he spake by me  for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand  and given it to thi neighbour  even to david  28  18 becaus thou obeyedst not the voic of the lord  nor executedst his fierc wrath upon amalek  therefor hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day  28  19 moreov the lord will also deliv israel with thee into the hand of the philistin  and to morrow shalt thou and thi son be with me  the lord also shall deliv the host of israel into the hand of the philistin  28  20 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth  and was sore afraid  becaus of the word of samuel  and there was no strength in him  for he had eaten no bread all the day  nor all the night  28  21 and the woman came unto saul  and saw that he was sore troubl  and said unto him  behold  thine handmaid hath obey thi voic  and i have put my life in my hand  and have hearken unto thi word which thou spakest unto me  28  22 now therefor  i pray thee  hearken thou also unto the voic of thine handmaid  and let me set a morsel of bread befor thee  and eat  that thou mayest have strength  when thou goest on thi way  28  23 but he refus  and said  i will not eat  but his servant  togeth with the woman  compel him  and he hearken unto their voic  so he aros from the earth  and sat upon the bed  28  24 and the woman had a fat calf in the hous  and she hast  and kill it  and took flour  and knead it  and did bake unleaven bread thereof  28  25 and she brought it befor saul  and befor his servant  and they did eat  then they rose up  and went away that night  29  1 now the philistin gather togeth all their armi to aphek  and the israelit pitch by a fountain which is in jezreel  29  2 and the lord of the philistin pass on by hundr  and by thousand  but david and his men pass on in the rereward with achish  29  3 then said the princ of the philistin  what do these hebrew here  and achish said unto the princ of the philistin  is not this david  the servant of saul the king of israel  which hath been with me these day  or these year  and i have found no fault in him sinc he fell unto me unto this day  29  4 and the princ of the philistin were wroth with him  and the princ of the philistin said unto him  make this fellow return  that he may go again to his place which thou hast appoint him  and let him not go down with us to battl  lest in the battl he be an adversari to us  for wherewith should he reconcil himself unto his master  should it not be with the head of these men  29  5 is not this david  of whom they sang one to anoth in danc  say  saul slew his thousand  and david his ten thousand  29  6 then achish call david  and said unto him  sure  as the lord liveth  thou hast been upright  and thi go out and thi come in with me in the host is good in my sight  for i have not found evil in thee sinc the day of thi come unto me unto this day  nevertheless the lord favour thee not  29  7 wherefor now return  and go in peac  that thou displeas not the lord of the philistin  29  8 and david said unto achish  but what have i done  and what hast thou found in thi servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day  that i may not go fight against the enemi of my lord the king  29  9 and achish answer and said to david  i know that thou art good in my sight  as an angel of god  notwithstand the princ of the philistin have said  he shall not go up with us to the battl  29  10 wherefor now rise up earli in the morn with thi master  s servant that are come with thee  and as soon as ye be up earli in the morn  and have light  depart  29  11 so david and his men rose up earli to depart in the morn  to return into the land of the philistin  and the philistin went up to jezreel  30  1 and it came to pass  when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day  that the amalekit had invad the south  and ziklag  and smitten ziklag  and burn it with fire  30  2 and had taken the women captiv  that were therein  they slew not ani

were taken captiv  30  4 then david and the peopl that were with him lift up their voic and wept  until they had no more power to weep  30  5 and david  s two wive were taken captiv  ahinoam the jezreelitess  and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelit  30  6 and david was great distress  for the peopl spake of stone him  becaus the soul of all the peopl was griev  everi man for his son and

abod behind  which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor  30  11 and they found an egyptian in the field  and brought him to david  and gave him bread  and he did eat  and they made him drink water  30  12 and they gave him a piec of a cake of fig  and two cluster of raisin  and when he had eaten  his spirit came again to him  for he had eaten no bread  nor drunk ani water  three day and three night  30  13 and david said unto him  to whom belongest thou  and whenc art thou  and he said  i am a young man of egypt  servant to an amalekit  and my master left me  becaus three day agon i fell sick  30  14 we made an invas upon the south of the cherethit  and upon the coast which belongeth to judah  and upon the south of caleb  and we burn ziklag with fire  30  15 and david said to him  canst thou bring me down to this compani  and he said  swear unto me by god  that thou wilt neither kill me  nor deliv me into the hand of my master  and i will bring thee down to this compani  30  16 and when he had brought him down  behold  they were spread abroad upon all the earth  eat and drink  and danc  becaus of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistin  and out of the land of judah  30  17 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the even of the next day  and there escap not a man of them  save four hundr young men  which rode

 s spoil  30  21 and david came to the two hundr men  which were so faint that they could not follow david  whom they had made also to abid at the brook besor  and they went forth to meet david  and to meet the peopl that were with him  and when david came near to the peopl  he salut them  30  22 then answer all the wick men and men of belial  of those that went with david  and said  becaus they went not with us  we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recov  save to everi man his wife and his children  that they may lead them away  and depart  30  23 then said david  ye shall not do so  my brethren  with that which the lord hath given us  who hath preserv us  and deliv the compani that came against us into our hand  30  24 for who will hearken unto you in this matter  but as his part is that goeth down to the battl  so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff  they shall part alik  30  25 and it was so from that day forward  that he made it a statut and an ordin for israel unto this day  30  26 and when david came to ziklag  he sent of the spoil unto the elder of judah  even to his friend  say  behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemi of the lord  30  27 to them which were in bethel  and to them which were in south ramoth  and to them which were in jattir  30  28 and to them which were in aroer  and to them which were in siphmoth  and to them

in hormah  and to them which were in chorashan  and to them which were in athach  30  31 and to them which were in hebron  and to all the place where david himself and his men were wont to haunt  31  1 now the philistin fought against israel  and the men of israel fled from befor the philistin  and fell down slain in mount gilboa  31  2 and the philistin follow hard upon saul and upon his son  and the philistin slew jonathan  and abinadab  and melchishua  saul  s son  31  3 and the battl went sore against saul  and the archer hit him  and he was sore wound of the archer  31  4 then said saul unto his armourbear  draw thi sword  and thrust me through therewith  lest these uncircumcis come and thrust me through  and abus me  but his armourbear would not  for he was sore afraid  therefor saul took a sword  and fell upon it  31  5 and when his armourbear saw that saul was dead  he fell likewis upon his sword  and die with him  31  6 so saul die  and his three son  and his armourbear

that saul and his son were dead  they forsook the citi  and fled  and the philistin came and dwelt in them  31  8 and it came to pass on the morrow  when the philistin came to strip the slain  that they found saul and his three son fallen in mount gilboa  31  9 and they cut off his head  and strip off his armour  and sent into the land of the philistin round about  to publish it in the hous of their idol  and among the peopl  31  10 and they put his armour in the hous of ashtaroth  and they fasten his bodi to the wall of bethshan  31  11 and when the inhabit of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistin had done to saul  31  12 all the valiant men aros  and went all night  and took the bodi of saul and the bodi of his son from the wall of bethshan  and came to jabesh  and burnt them there  31  13 and they took their bone  and buri them under a tree at jabesh  and fast seven day  the second book of samuel otherwis call  the second book of the king 1  1 now it came to pass after the death of saul  when david was return from the slaughter of the amalekit  and david had abod two day in ziklag  1  2 it came even to pass on the third day  that  behold  a man came out of the camp from saul with his cloth rent  and earth upon his head  and so it was  when he came to david  that he fell to the earth  and did obeis  1  3 and david said unto him  from whenc comest thou  and

young man that told him said  as i happen by chanc upon mount gilboa  behold  saul lean upon his spear  and  lo  the chariot and horsemen follow hard after him  1  7 and when he look behind him  he saw me  and call unto me  and i answer  here am i  1  8 and he said unto me  who art thou  and i answer him  i am an amalekit  1  9 he said unto me again  stand  i pray thee  upon me  and slay me  for anguish is come upon me  becaus my life is yet whole in me  1  10 so i stood upon him  and slew him  becaus i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen  and i took the crown that was upon his head  and the bracelet that was on his arm  and have brought them hither unto my lord  1  11 then david took hold on his cloth  and rent them  and likewis all the men that were with him  1  12 and they mourn  and wept  and fast until even  for saul  and for jonathan his son  and for the peopl of the lord  and for the hous of israel  becaus they were fallen by the sword  1  13 and david said unto the young man that told him  whenc art thou  and he answer  i am the son of a stranger  an amalekit  1  14 and david said unto him  how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord  s anoint  1  15 and david call one of the young men  and said  go near  and fall upon him  and he smote him that he die  1  16 and david said unto him  thi blood be upon thi head  for thi mouth hath testifi against thee  say  i have slain the lord  s anoint  1  17 and david lament with this lament over saul and over jonathan his son  1  18  also he bade them teach the children

 nor field of offer  for there the shield of the mighti is vile cast away  the shield of saul  as though he had not been anoint with oil  1  22 from the blood of the slain  from the fat of the mighti  the bow of jonathan turn not back  and the sword of saul return not empti  1  23 saul and jonathan were love and pleasant in their live  and in their death they were not divid  they were swifter than

how long shall it be then  ere thou bid the peopl return from follow their brethren  2  27 and joab said  as god liveth  unless thou hadst spoken  sure then in the morn the peopl had gone up everi one from follow his brother  2  28 so joab blew a trumpet  and all the peopl stood still  and pursu after israel no more  neither fought they ani more  2  29 and abner and his men walk all that night

the hous of saul thi father  to his brethren  and to his friend  and have not deliv thee into the hand of david  that thou chargest me to day with a fault concern this woman  3  9 so do god to abner  and more also  except  as the lord hath sworn to david  even so i do to him  3  10 to translat the kingdom from the hous of saul  and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah  from dan even to beersheba  3  11 and he could not answer abner a word again  becaus he fear him  3  12 and abner sent messeng to david on his behalf  say  whose is the land  say also  make thi leagu with me  and  behold  my hand shall be with thee  to bring about all israel unto thee  3  13 and he said  well  i will make a leagu with thee  but one thing i requir of thee  that is  thou shalt not see my

then said abner unto him  go  return  and he return  3  17 and abner had communic with the elder of israel  say  ye sought for david in time past to be king over you  3  18 now then do it  for the lord hath spoken of david  say  by the hand of my servant david i will save my peopl israel out of the hand of the philistin  and out of the hand of all their enemi  3  19 and abner also spake in the ear of benjamin  and abner went also to speak in the ear of david in hebron all that seem good to israel  and that seem good to the whole hous of benjamin  3  20 so abner came to david to hebron  and twenti men with him  and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast  3  21 and abner said unto david  i will aris and go  and will gather all israel unto my lord the king  that they may

 they told joab  say  abner the son of ner came to the king  and he hath sent him away  and he is gone in peac  3  24 then joab came to the king  and said  what hast thou done  behold  abner came unto

thou doest  3  26 and when joab was come out from david  he sent messeng after abner  which brought him again from the well of sirah  but david knew it not  3  27 and when abner was return to hebron  joab took him asid in the gate to speak with him quiet  and smote him there under the fifth rib  that he die  for the blood of asahel his brother  3  28 and afterward when david heard it  he said  i

of joab one that hath an issu  or that is a leper  or that leaneth on a staff  or that falleth on the sword  or that lacketh bread  3  30 so joab  and abishai his brother slew abner  becaus he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battl  3  31 and david said to joab  and to all the peopl that were with him  rend your cloth  and gird you with sackcloth  and mourn befor abner  and king

and the king said unto his servant  know ye not that there is a princ and a great man fallen this day in israel  3  39 and i am this day weak  though anoint king  and these men the son of zeruiah be too hard for me  the lord shall reward the doer of evil accord to his wicked  4  1 and when saul  s son heard that abner was dead in hebron  his hand were feebl  and all the israelit were troubl  4  2 and saul  s son had two men that were captain of band  the name of the one was baanah  and the name of the other rechab  the son of rimmon a beerothit  of the children of benjamin   for beeroth also was reckon to benjamin  4  3 and the beerothit fled to gittaim  and were sojourn there until this day  4  4 and jonathan  saul  s son  had a son that was lame of his feet  he was five year old when the tide came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel  and his nurs took him up  and fled  and it came to pass  as she made hast to flee  that he fell  and becam lame  and his name was mephibosheth  4  5

own hous upon his bed  shall i not therefor now requir his blood of your hand  and take you away from the earth  4  12 and david command his young men  and they slew them  and cut off their hand and their feet  and hang them up over the pool in hebron  but they took the head of ishbosheth  and buri it in the sepulchr of abner in hebron  5  1 then came all the tribe of israel to david unto hebron  and spake  say  behold  we are thi bone and thi flesh  5  2 also in time past  when saul was king over us  thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel  and the lord said to thee  thou shalt

 8 and david was displeas  becaus the lord had made a breach upon uzzah  and he call the name of the place perezuzzah to this day  6  9 and david was afraid of the lord that day  and said  how shall

behold  there came much peopl by the way of the hill side behind him  13  35 and jonadab said unto the king  behold  the king  s son come  as thi servant said  so it is  13  36 and it came to pass  as soon as he had made an end of speak  that  behold  the king  s son came  and lift up their voic and wept  and the king also and all his servant wept veri sore  13  37 but absalom fled  and went to

did obeis  and said  help  o king  14  5 and the king said unto her  what aileth thee  and she answer  i am inde a widow woman  and mine husband is dead  14  6 and thi handmaid had two son  and they

him that smote his brother  that we may kill him  for the life of his brother whom he slew  and we will destroy the heir also  and so they shall quench my coal which is left  and shall not leav to my husband neither name nor remaind upon the earth  14  8 and the king said unto the woman  go to thine hous  and i will give charg concern thee  14  9 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king  my lord  o king  the iniqu be on me  and on my father  s hous  and the king and his throne be guiltless  14  10 and the king said  whoever saith ought unto thee  bring him to me  and he shall not touch thee ani more  14  11 then said she  i pray thee  let the king rememb the lord thi god  that thou wouldest not suffer the reveng of blood to destroy ani more  lest they destroy my son  and he said  as the lord liveth  there shall not one hair of thi son fall to the earth  14  12 then the woman said  let thine handmaid  i pray thee  speak one word unto my lord the king  and he said  say on  14  13 and the woman said  wherefor then hast thou thought such a thing against the peopl of god  for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulti  in that the king doth not fetch home again his banish  14  14 for we must need die  and are as water spilt on the ground  which cannot be gather up again  neither doth god respect ani person  yet doth he devis mean  that his banish be not expel from him  14  15 now therefor that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king  it is becaus the peopl have made me afraid  and thi handmaid said  i will now speak unto the king  it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid  14  16 for the king will hear  to deliv his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son togeth out of the inherit of god  14  17 then thine handmaid said  the word of my lord the king shall now be comfort  for as an angel of god  so is my lord the king to discern good and bad  therefor the lord thi god will be with thee  14  18 then the king answer and said unto the woman  hide not from me  i pray thee  the thing that i shall ask thee  and the woman said  let my lord the king now speak  14  19 and the king said  is not the hand of joab with thee in all this  and the woman answer and said  as thi soul liveth  my lord the king  none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken  for thi servant joab  he bade me  and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid  14  20 to fetch about this form of speech hath thi servant joab done this thing  and my lord is wise  accord to the wisdom of an angel of god  to know all thing that are in the earth  14  21 and the king said unto joab  behold now  i have done this thing  go therefor  bring the young man absalom again  14  22 and joab fell to the ground on his face  and bow himself  and thank the king  and joab said  to day thi servant knoweth that i have found grace in thi sight  my lord  o king  in that the king hath fulfil the request of his servant  14  23 so joab aros and went to geshur  and brought absalom to jerusalem  14  24 and the king said  let him turn to his own hous  and let him not see my face  so absalom return to his own hous  and saw not the king  s face  14  25 but in all israel there was none to be so much prais as absalom for his beauti  from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his

head at two hundr shekel after the king  s weight  14  27 and unto absalom there were born three son  and one daughter  whose name was tamar  she was a woman of a fair counten  14  28 so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem  and saw not the king  s face  14  29 therefor absalom sent for joab  to have sent him to the king  but he would not come to him  and when he sent again the second time  he would not come  14  30 therefor he said unto his servant  see  joab  s field is near mine  and he hath barley there  go and set it on fire  and absalom  s servant set the field on fire  14  31 then joab aros  and came to absalom unto his hous  and said unto him  wherefor have thi servant set my field on fire  14  32 and absalom answer joab  behold  i sent unto thee  say  come hither  that i may send thee to the king  to say  wherefor am i come from geshur  it had been good for me to have been there still  now therefor let me see the king  s face  and if there be ani iniqu in me  let him kill

lord  i pray thee  turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolish  15  32 and it came to pass  that when david was come to the top of the mount  where he worship god  behold  hushai the archit came to meet him with his coat rent  and earth upon his head  15  33 unto whom david said  if thou passest on with me  then thou shalt be a burden unto me  15  34 but if thou return to the citi  and say unto absalom  i will be thi servant  o king  as i have been thi father  s servant hitherto  so will i now also be thi servant  then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel  15  35 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priest  therefor it shall be  that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king  s hous  thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priest  15  36 behold  they have there with them their two son  ahimaaz zadok  s son  and jonathan abiathar  s son  and by them ye shall send unto me everi thing that ye can hear  15  37 so hushai david  s friend came into the citi  and absalom came into jerusalem  16  1 and when david was a littl past the top of the hill  behold  ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him  with a coupl of ass saddl  and upon them two hundr loav of bread  and an hundr bunch of raisin  and an hundr of summer fruit  and a bottl of wine  16  2 and the king said unto ziba  what meanest thou by these  and ziba said  the ass be for the king  s household to ride on  and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat  and the wine  that such as be faint in the wilder may drink  16  3 and the king said  and where is thi master  s son  and ziba said unto the king  behold  he abideth at jerusalem  for he said  to day shall the hous of israel restor me the kingdom of my father  16  4 then said the king to ziba  behold  thine are all that pertain unto mephibosheth  and ziba said  i humbl beseech thee that i may find grace in thi sight  my lord  o king  16  5 and when king david came to bahurim  behold  thenc came out a man of the famili of the hous of saul  whose name was shimei  the son of gera  he came forth  and curs still as he came  16  6 and he cast stone at david  and at all the servant of king david  and all the peopl and all the mighti men were on his right hand and on his left  16  7 and thus said shimei when he curs  come out  come out  thou bloodi man  and thou man of belial  16  8 the lord hath return upon thee all the blood of the hous of saul  in whose stead thou hast reign  and the lord hath deliv the kingdom into the hand of absalom thi son  and  behold  thou art taken in thi mischief  becaus thou art a bloodi man  16  9 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king  whi should this dead dog curs my lord the king  let me go over  i pray thee  and take off his head  16  10 and the king said  what have i to do with you  ye son of zeruiah  so let him curs  becaus the lord hath said unto him  curs david  who shall then say  wherefor hast thou done so  16  11 and david said to abishai  and to all his servant  behold  my son  which came forth of my bowel  seeketh my life  how much more now may this benjamit do it  let him alon  and let him curs  for the lord hath bidden him  16  12 it may be that the lord will look on mine afflict  and that the lord will requit me good for his curs this day  16  13 and as david and his men went by the way  shimei went along on the hill  s side over against him  and curs as he went  and threw stone at him  and cast dust  16  14 and the king  and all the peopl that were with him  came weari  and refresh themselv there  16  15 and absalom  and all the peopl the men of israel  came to jerusalem  and ahithophel with him  16  16 and it came to pass  when hushai the archit  david  s friend  was come unto absalom  that hushai said unto absalom  god save the king  god save the king  16  17 and absalom said to hushai  is this thi kind to thi friend  whi wentest thou not with thi friend  16  18 and hushai said unto absalom  nay  but whom the lord  and this peopl  and all the men of israel  choos  his will i be  and with him will i abid  16  19 and again  whom should i serv  should i not serv in the presenc of his son  as i have serv in thi father  s presenc  so will i be in thi presenc  16  20 then said absalom to ahithophel  give counsel among you what we shall do  16  21 and ahithophel said unto absalom  go in unto thi father  s concubin  which he hath left to keep the hous  and all israel shall hear that thou art abhor of thi father  then shall the hand of all that are with thee be strong  16  22 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the hous  and absalom went in unto his father  s concubin in the sight of all israel  16  23 and the counsel of ahithophel  which he counsel in those day  was as if a man had enquir at the oracl of god  so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom  17  1 moreov ahithophel said unto absalom  let me now choos out twelv thousand men  and i will aris and pursu after david this night  17  2 and i will come upon him while he is weari and weak hand  and will make him afraid  and all the peopl that are with him shall flee  and i will smite the king onli  17  3 and i will bring back all the peopl unto thee  the man whom thou seekest is as if all return  so all the peopl shall be in peac  17  4 and the say pleas absalom well  and all the elder of israel  17  5 then said absalom  call now hushai the archit also  and let us hear likewis what he saith  17  6 and when hushai was come to absalom  absalom spake unto him  say  ahithophel hath spoken after this manner  shall we do after his say  if not  speak thou  17  7 and hushai said unto absalom  the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time  17  8 for  said hushai  thou knowest thi father and his men  that they be mighti men  and they be chafe in their mind  as a bear rob of her whelp in the field  and thi father is a man of war  and will not lodg with the peopl  17  9 behold  he is hid now in some pit  or in some other place  and it will come to pass  when some of them be overthrown at the first  that whosoev heareth it will say  there is a slaughter among the peopl that follow absalom  17  10 and he also that is valiant  whose heart is as the heart of a lion  shall utter melt  for all israel knoweth that thi father is a mighti man  and they which be with him are valiant men  17  11 therefor i counsel that all israel be general gather unto thee  from dan even to beersheba  as the sand that is by the sea for multitud  and that thou go to battl in thine own person  17  12 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found  and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground  and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one  17  13 moreov  if he be gotten into a citi  then shall all israel bring rope to that citi  and we will draw it into the river  until there be not one small stone found there  17  14 and absalom and all the men of israel said  the counsel of hushai the archit is better than the counsel of ahithophel  for the lord had appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel  to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom  17  15 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest  thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel  and thus and thus have i counsel  17  16 now therefor send quick  and tell david  say  lodg not this night in the plain of the wilder  but speedili pass over  lest the king be swallow up  and all the peopl that are with him  17  17 now jonathan and ahimaaz stay by enrogel  for they might not be seen to come into the citi  and a wench went and told them  and they went and told king david  17  18 nevertheless a lad saw them  and told absalom  but they went both of them away quick  and came to a man  s hous in bahurim  which had a well in his court  whither they went down  17  19 and the woman took and spread a cover over the well  s mouth  and spread ground corn thereon  and the thing was not known  17  20 and when absalom  s servant came to the woman to the hous  they said  where is ahimaaz and jonathan  and the woman said unto them  they be gone over the brook of water  and when they had sought and could not find them  they return to jerusalem  17  21 and it came to pass  after they were depart  that they came up out of the well  and went and told king david  and said unto david  aris  and pass quick over the water  for thus hath ahithophel counsel against you  17  22 then david aros  and all the peopl that were with him  and they pass over jordan  by the morn light there lack not one of them that was not gone over jordan  17  23 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not follow  he saddl his ass  and aros  and gat him home to his hous  to his citi  and put his household in order  and hang himself  and die  and was buri in the sepulchr of his father  17  24 then david came to mahanaim  and absalom pass over jordan  he and all the men of israel with him  17  25 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab  which amasa was a man  s son  whose name was ithra an israelit  that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash  sister to zeruiah joab  s mother  17  26 so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead  17  27 and it came to pass  when david was come to mahanaim  that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon  and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar  and barzillai the gileadit of rogelim  17  28 brought bed  and bason  and earthen vessel  and wheat  and barley  and flour  and parch corn  and bean  and lentil  and parch puls  17  29 and honey  and butter  and sheep  and chees of kine  for david  and for the peopl that were with him  to eat  for they said  the peopl is hungri  and weari  and thirsti  in the wilder  18  1 and david number the peopl that were with him  and set captain of thousand  and captain of hundr over them  18  2 and david sent forth a third part of the peopl under the hand of joab  and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah  joab  s brother  and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittit  and the king said unto the peopl  i will sure go forth with you myself also  18  3 but the peopl answer  thou shalt not go forth  for if we flee away  they will not care for us  neither if half of us die  will they care for us  but now thou art worth ten thousand of us  therefor now it is better that thou succour us out of the citi  18  4 and the king said unto them  what seemeth you best i will do  and the king stood by the gate side  and all the peopl came out by hundr and by thousand  18  5 and the king command joab and abishai and ittai  say  deal gentl for my sake with the young man  even with absalom  and all the peopl heard when the king gave all the captain charg concern absalom  18  6 so the peopl went out into the field against israel  and the battl was in the wood of ephraim  18  7 where the peopl of israel were slain befor the servant of david  and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenti thousand men  18  8 for the battl was there scatter over the face of all the countri  and the wood devour more peopl that day than the sword devour  18  9 and absalom met the servant of david  and absalom rode upon a mule  and the mule went under the thick bough of a great oak  and his head caught hold of the oak  and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth  and the mule that was under him went away  18  10 and a certain man saw it  and told joab  and said  behold  i saw absalom hang in an oak  18  11 and joab said unto the man that told him  and  behold  thou sawest him  and whi didst thou not smite him there to the ground  and i would have given thee ten shekel of silver  and a girdl  18  12 and the man said unto joab  though i should receiv a thousand shekel of silver in mine hand  yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king  s son  for in our hear the king charg thee and abishai and ittai  say  bewar that none touch the young man absalom  18  13 otherwis i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life  for there is no matter hid from the king  and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me  18  14 then said joab  i may not tarri thus with thee  and he took three dart in his hand  and thrust them through the heart of absalom  while he was yet aliv in the midst of the oak  18  15 and ten young men that bare joab  s armour compass about and smote absalom  and slew him  18  16 and joab blew the trumpet  and the peopl return from pursu after israel  for joab held back the peopl  18  17 and they took absalom  and cast him into a great pit in the wood  and laid a veri great heap of stone upon him  and all israel fled everi one to his tent  18  18 now absalom in his lifetim had taken and rear up for himself a pillar  which is in the king  s dale  for he said  i have no son to keep my name in remembr  and he call the pillar after his own name  and it is call unto this day  absalom  s place  18  19 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok  let me now run  and bear the king tide  how that the lord hath aveng him of his enemi  18  20 and joab said unto him  thou shalt not bear tide this day  but thou shalt bear tide anoth day  but this day thou shalt bear no tide  becaus the king  s son is dead  18  21 then said joab to cushi  go tell the king what thou hast seen  and cushi bow himself unto joab  and ran  18  22 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab  but howsoev  let me  i pray thee  also run after cushi  and joab said  wherefor wilt thou run  my son  see that thou hast no tide readi  18  23 but howsoev  said he  let me run  and he said unto him  run  then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain  and overran cushi  18  24 and david sat between the two gate  and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall  and lift up his eye  and look  and behold a man run alon  18  25 and the watchman cri  and told the king  and the king said  if he be alon  there is tide in his mouth  and he came apac  and drew near  18  26 and the watchman saw anoth man run  and the watchman call unto the porter  and said  behold anoth man run alon  and the king said  he also bringeth tide  18  27 and the watchman said  me thinketh the run of the foremost is like the run of ahimaaz the son of zadok  and the king said  he is a good man  and cometh with good tide  18  28 and ahimaaz call  and said unto the king  all is well  and he fell down to the earth upon his face befor the king  and said  bless be the lord thi god  which hath deliv up the men that lift up their hand against my lord the king  18  29 and the king said  is the young man absalom safe  and ahimaaz answer  when joab sent the king  s servant  and me thi servant  i saw a great tumult  but i knew not what it was  18  30 and the king said unto him  turn asid  and stand here  and he turn asid  and stood still  18  31 and  behold  cushi came  and cushi said  tide  my lord the king  for the lord hath aveng thee this day of all them that rose up against thee  18  32 and the king said unto cushi  is the young man absalom safe  and cushi answer  the enemi of my lord the king  and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt  be as that young man is  18  33 and the king was much move  and went up to the chamber over the gate  and wept  and as he went  thus he said  o my son absalom  my son  my son absalom  would god i had die for thee  o absalom  my son  my son  19  1 and it was told joab  behold  the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom  19  2 and the victori that day was turn into mourn unto all the peopl  for the peopl heard say that day how the king was griev for his son  19  3 and the peopl gat them by stealth that day into the citi  as peopl be asham steal away when they flee in battl  19  4 but the king cover his face  and the king cri with a loud voic  o my son absalom  o absalom  my son  my son  19  5 and joab came into the hous to the king  and said  thou hast shame this day the face of all thi servant  which this day have save thi life  and the live of thi son and of thi daughter  and the live of thi wive  and the live of thi concubin  19  6 in that thou lovest thine enemi  and hatest thi friend  for thou hast declar this day  that thou regardest neither princ nor servant  for this day i perceiv  that if absalom had live  and all we had die this day  then it had pleas thee well  19  7 now therefor aris  go forth  and speak comfort unto thi servant  for i swear by the lord  if thou go not forth  there will not tarri one with thee this night  and that will be wors unto thee than all the evil that befel thee from thi youth until now  19  8 then the king aros  and sat in the gate  and they told unto all the peopl  say  behold  the king doth sit in the gate  and all the peopl came befor the king  for israel had fled everi man to his tent  19  9 and all the peopl were at strife throughout all the tribe of israel  say  the king save us out of the hand of our enemi  and he deliv us out of the hand of the philistin  and now he is fled out of the land for absalom  19  10 and absalom  whom we anoint over us  is dead in battl  now therefor whi speak ye not a word of bring the king back  19  11 and king david sent to

barzillai  come thou over with me  and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem  19  34 and barzillai said unto the king  how long have i to live  that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem  19  35 i am this day fourscor year old  and can i discern between good and evil  can thi servant tast what i eat or what i drink  can i hear ani more the voic of sing men and sing women  wherefor then should thi servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king  19  36 thi servant will go a littl way over jordan with the king  and whi should the king recompens it me with such a reward  19  37 let thi servant  i pray thee  turn back again  that i may die in mine own citi  and be buri by the grave of my father and of my mother  but behold thi servant chimham  let him go over with my lord the king  and do to

will i do for thee  19  39 and all the peopl went over jordan  and when the king was come over  the king kiss barzillai  and bless him  and he return unto his own place  19  40 then the king went on to gilgal  and chimham went on with him  and all the peopl of judah conduct the king  and also half the peopl of israel  19  41 and  behold  all the men of israel came to the king  and said unto the

trumpet  and said  we have no part in david  neither have we inherit in the son of jess  everi man to his tent  o israel  20  2 so everi man of israel went up from after david  and follow sheba the son of bichri  but the men of judah clave unto their king  from jordan even to jerusalem  20  3 and david came to his hous at jerusalem  and the king took the ten women his concubin  whom he had left to keep the hous  and put them in ward  and fed them  but went not in unto them  so they were shut up unto the day of their death  live in widowhood  20  4 then said the king to amasa  assembl me the men of judah within three day  and be thou here present  20  5 so amasa went to assembl the men of judah  but he tarri longer than the set time which he had appoint him  20  6 and david said to abishai  now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom  take thou thi lord  s servant  and pursu after him  lest he get him fenc citi  and escap us  20  7 and there went out after him joab  s men  and the cherethit  and the pelethit  and all the mighti men  and they went out of jerusalem  to pursu after sheba the son of bichri  20  8 when they were at the great stone which is

out  20  9 and joab said to amasa  art thou in health  my brother  and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him  20  10 but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joab  s hand  so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib  and shed out his bowel to the ground  and struck him not again  and he die  so joab and abishai his brother pursu after sheba the son of bichri  20  11 and one of joab  s men stood by him  and said  he that favoureth joab  and he that is for david  let him go after joab  20  12 and amasa wallow in blood in the midst of the highway  and when the man saw that all the peopl stood still  he remov amasa out of the highway into the field  and cast a cloth upon him  when he saw that everi one that came by him stood still  20  13 when he was remov out of the highway  all the peopl went on after joab  to pursu after sheba the son of bichri  20  14 and he went through all the tribe of israel unto abel  and to bethmaachah  and all the berit  and they

mother in israel  whi wilt thou swallow up the inherit of the lord  20  20 and joab answer and said  far be it  far be it from me  that i should swallow up or destroy  20  21 the matter is not so  but

israel  and he move david against them to say  go  number israel and judah  24  2 for the king said to joab the captain of the host  which was with him  go now through all the tribe of israel  from

hundredfold  and that the eye of my lord the king may see it  but whi doth my lord the king delight in this thing  24  4 notwithstand the king  s word prevail against joab  and against the captain of the host  and joab and the captain of the host went out from the presenc of the king  to number the peopl of israel  24  5 and they pass over jordan  and pitch in aroer  on the right side of the citi that lieth in the midst of the river of gad  and toward jazer  24  6 then they came to gilead  and to the land of tahtimhodshi  and they came to danjaan  and about to zidon  24  7 and came to the strong hold of tyre  and to all the citi of the hivit  and of the canaanit  and they went out to the south of judah  even to beersheba  24  8 so when they had gone through all the land  they came to jerusalem at the end of nine month and twenti day  24  9 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the peopl unto the king  and there were in israel eight hundr thousand valiant men that drew the sword  and the men of judah were five hundr thousand men  24  10 and david  s heart smote him after that he had number the peopl  and david said unto the lord  i have sin great in that i have done  and now  i beseech thee  o lord  take away the iniqu of thi servant  for i have done veri foolish  24  11 for when david was up in the morn  the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad  david  s seer  say  24  12 go and say unto david  thus saith the lord  i offer thee three thing  choos thee one of them  that i may do it unto thee  24  13 so gad came to david  and told him  and said unto him  shall seven year of famin come unto thee in thi land  or wilt thou flee three month befor thine enemi  while they pursu thee  or that there be three day  pestil in thi land  now advis  and see what

of man  24  15 so the lord sent a pestil upon israel from the morn even to the time appoint  and there die of the peopl from dan even to beersheba seventi thousand men  24  16 and when the angel stretch out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it  the lord repent him of the evil  and said to the angel that destroy the peopl  it is enough  stay now thine hand  and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplac of araunah the jebusit  24  17 and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the peopl  and said  lo  i have sin  and i have done wick  but these sheep  what have they done  let thine hand  i pray thee  be against me  and against my father  s hous  24  18 and gad came that day to david  and said unto him  go up  rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusit  24  19 and david  accord to the say of gad  went up as the lord command  24  20 and araunah look  and saw the king and his servant come on toward him  and araunah went out  and bow himself befor the king on his face upon the ground  24  21 and araunah said  wherefor is my lord the king come to his servant  and david said  to buy the threshingfloor of thee  to build an altar unto the lord  that the plagu may be stay from the peopl  24  22 and araunah said unto david  let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him  behold  here be oxen for burnt sacrific  and thresh instrument and other instrument of the oxen for wood  24  23 all these thing did araunah  as a king  give unto the king  and araunah said unto the king  the lord thi god accept thee  24  24 and the king said unto araunah  nay  but i will sure buy it of thee at a price  neither will i offer burnt offer unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me noth  so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifti shekel of silver  24  25 and david built there an altar unto the lord  and offer burnt offer and peac offer  so the lord was intreat for the land  and the plagu was stay from israel  the first book of the king common call  the third book of the king 1  1 now king david was old and stricken in year  and they cover him with cloth  but he gat no heat  1  2 wherefor his servant said unto him  let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin  and let her stand befor the king  and let her cherish him  and let her lie in thi bosom  that my lord the

earth may know that the lord is god  and that there is none els  8  61 let your heart therefor be perfect with the lord our god  to walk in his statut  and to keep his command  as at this day  8  62 and the king  and all israel with him  offer sacrific befor the lord  8  63 and solomon offer a sacrific of peac offer  which he offer unto the lord  two and twenti thousand oxen  and an hundr and twenti thousand sheep  so the king and all the children of israel dedic the hous of the lord  8  64 the same day did the king hallow the middl of the court that was befor the hous of the lord  for there he offer burnt offer  and meat offer  and the fat of the peac offer  becaus the brasen altar that was befor the lord was too littl to receiv the burnt offer  and meat offer  and the fat of the

even fourteen day  8  66 on the eighth day he sent the peopl away  and they bless the king  and went unto their tent joy and glad of heart for all the good that the lord had done for david his servant  and for israel his peopl  9  1 and it came to pass  when solomon had finish the build of the hous of the lord  and the king  s hous  and all solomon  s desir which he was pleas to do  9  2 that the lord appear to solomon the second time  as he had appear unto him at gibeon  9  3 and the lord said unto him  i have heard thi prayer and thi supplic  that thou hast made befor me  i have hallow this hous  which thou hast built  to put my name there for ever  and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetu  9  4 and if thou wilt walk befor me  as david thi father walk  in integr of heart  and in upright  to do accord to all that i have command thee  and wilt keep my statut and my judgment  9  5 then i will establish the throne of thi kingdom upon israel for ever  as i promis to david thi father  say  there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel  9  6 but if ye shall at all turn from follow me  ye or your children  and will not keep my command and my statut which i have set befor you  but go and serv other god  and worship them  9  7 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them  and this hous  which i have hallow for my name  will i cast out of my sight  and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peopl  9  8 and at this hous  which is high  everi one that passeth by it shall be astonish  and shall hiss  and they shall say  whi hath the lord done thus unto this land  and to this hous  9  9 and they shall answer  becaus they forsook the lord their god  who brought forth their father out of the land of egypt  and have taken hold upon other god  and have worship them  and serv them  therefor hath the lord brought upon them all this evil  9  10 and it came to pass at the end of twenti year  when solomon had built the two hous

given me  my brother  and he call them the land of cabul unto this day  9  14 and hiram sent to the king sixscor talent of gold  9  15 and this is the reason of the levi which king solomon rais  for to build the hous of the lord  and his own hous  and millo  and the wall of jerusalem  and hazor  and megiddo  and gezer  9  16 for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up  and taken gezer  and burnt it

that were left after them in the land  whom the children of israel also were not abl utter to destroy  upon those did solomon levi a tribut of bondservic unto this day  9  22 but of the children of

were over solomon  s work  five hundr and fifti  which bare rule over the peopl that wrought in the work  9  24 but pharaoh  s daughter came up out of the citi of david unto her hous which solomon had built for her  then did he build millo  9  25 and three time in a year did solomon offer burnt offer and peac offer upon the altar which he built unto the lord  and he burnt incens upon the altar that was befor the lord  so he finish the hous  9  26 and king solomon made a navi of ship in eziongeb  which is besid eloth  on the shore of the red sea  in the land of edom  9  27 and hiram sent in the navi his servant  shipmen that had knowledg of the sea  with the servant of solomon  9  28 and they came to ophir  and fetch from thenc gold  four hundr and twenti talent  and brought it to king

with camel that bare spice  and veri much gold  and precious stone  and when she was come to solomon  she commune with him of all that was in her heart  10  3 and solomon told her all her question  there was not ani thing hid from the king  which he told her not  10  4 and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon  s wisdom  and the hous that he had built  10  5 and the meat of his tabl  and the sit of his servant  and the attend of his minist  and their apparel  and his cupbear  and his ascent by which he went up unto the hous of the lord  there was no more spirit in her  10  6 and she said to the king  it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thi act and of thi wisdom  10  7 howbeit i believ not the word  until i came  and mine eye had seen it  and  behold  the half was not told me  thi wisdom and prosper exceedeth the fame which i heard  10  8 happi are thi men  happi are these thi servant  which stand continu befor thee  and that hear thi wisdom  10  9 bless be the lord thi god  which delight in thee  to set thee on the throne of israel  becaus the lord love israel for ever  therefor made he thee king  to do judgment and justic  10  10 and she gave the king an hundr and twenti talent of gold  and of spice veri great store  and precious stone  there came no more such abund of spice as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon  10  11 and the navi also of hiram  that brought gold from ophir  brought in from ophir great plenti of almug tree  and precious stone  10  12 and the king made of the almug tree pillar for the hous of the lord  and for the king  s hous  harp also and psalteri for singer  there came no such almug tree  nor were seen unto this day  10  13 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desir  whatsoev she ask  besid that which solomon gave her of his royal bounti  so she turn and went to her own countri  she and her servant  10  14 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundr threescor and six talent of gold  10  15 besid that he had of the merchantmen  and of the traffick of the spice merchant  and of all the king of arabia  and of the governor of the countri  10  16 and

ape  and peacock  10  23 so king solomon exceed all the king of the earth for rich and for wisdom  10  24 and all the earth sought to solomon  to hear his wisdom  which god had put in his heart  10  25 and they brought everi man his present  vessel of silver  and vessel of gold  and garment  and armour  and spice  hors  and mule  a rate year by year  10  26 and solomon gather togeth chariot and

11  14 and the lord stir up an adversari unto solomon  hadad the edomit  he was of the king  s seed in edom  11  15 for it came to pass  when david was in edom  and joab the captain of the host was

wise  11  23 and god stir him up anoth adversari  rezon the son of eliadah  which fled from his lord hadadez king of zobah  11  24 and he gather men unto him  and becam captain over a band  when david slew them of zobah  and they went to damascus  and dwelt therein  and reign in damascus  11  25 and he was an adversari to israel all the day of solomon  besid the mischief that hadad did  and he abhor israel  and reign over syria  11  26 and jeroboam the son of nebat  an ephrathit of zereda  solomon  s servant  whose mother  s name was zeruah  a widow woman  even he lift up his hand against the king  11  27 and this was the caus that he lift up his hand against the king  solomon built millo  and repair the breach of the citi of david his father  11  28 and the man jeroboam was a mighti man of valour  and solomon see the young man that he was industri  he made him ruler over all the charg of the hous of joseph  11  29 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem  that the prophet ahijah the shilonit found him in the way  and he had clad himself with a new garment  and they two were alon in the field  11  30 and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him  and rent it in twelv piec  11  31 and he said to jeroboam  take thee ten piec  for thus saith the lord  the god of israel  behold  i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon  and will give ten tribe to thee  11  32  but he shall have one tribe for my servant david  s sake  and for jerusalem  s sake  the citi which i have chosen out of all the tribe of israel  11  33 becaus that they have forsaken me  and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonian  chemosh the god of the moabit  and milcom the god of the children of ammon  and have not walk in my way  to do that which is right in mine eye  and to keep my statut and my judgment  as did david his father  11  34 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand  but i will make him princ all the day of his life for david my servant  s sake  whom i chose  becaus he kept my command and my statut  11  35 but i will take the kingdom out of his son  s hand  and will give it unto thee  even ten tribe  11  36 and unto his son will i give one tribe  that david my servant may have a light alway befor me in jerusalem  the citi which i have chosen me to put my name there  11  37 and i will take thee  and thou shalt reign accord to all that thi soul desireth  and shalt be king over israel  11  38 and it shall be  if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee  and wilt walk in my way  and do that is right in my sight  to keep my statut and my command  as david my servant did  that i will be with thee  and build thee a sure hous  as i built for david  and will give israel unto thee  11  39 and i will for this afflict the seed of david  but not for ever  11  40 solomon sought therefor to kill jeroboam  and jeroboam aros  and fled into egypt  unto shishak king of egypt  and was in egypt until the death of solomon  11  41 and the rest of the act of solomon  and all that he did  and his wisdom  are they not written in the book of the act of solomon  11  42 and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel was forti year  11  43 and solomon slept with his father  and was buri in the citi of david his father  and rehoboam his son reign in his stead  12  1 and rehoboam went to shechem  for all israel were come to shechem to make him king  12  2 and it came to pass  when jeroboam the son of nebat  who was yet in egypt  heard of it   for he was fled from the presenc of king solomon  and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  12  3 that they sent and call him  and jeroboam and all the congreg of israel came  and spake unto rehoboam  say  12  4 thi father made our yoke grievous  now therefor make thou the grievous servic of thi father  and his heavi yoke which he put upon us  lighter  and we will serv thee  12  5 and he said unto them  depart yet for three day  then come again to me  and the peopl depart  12  6 and king rehoboam consult with the old men  that stood befor solomon his father while he yet live  and said  how do ye advis that i may answer this peopl  12  7 and they spake unto him  say  if thou wilt be a servant unto this peopl this day  and wilt serv them  and answer them  and speak good word to them  then they will be thi servant for ever  12  8 but he forsook the counsel of the old men  which they had given him  and consult with the young men that were grown up with him  and which stood befor him  12  9 and he said unto them  what counsel give ye that we may answer this peopl  who have spoken to me  say  make the yoke which thi father did put upon us lighter  12  10 and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him  say  thus shalt thou speak unto this peopl that spake unto thee  say  thi father made our yoke heavi  but make thou it lighter unto us  thus shalt thou say unto them  my littl finger shall be thicker than my father  s loin  12  11 and now wherea my father did lade you with a heavi yoke  i will add to your yoke  my father hath chastis you with whip  but i will chastis you with scorpion  12  12 so jeroboam and all the peopl came to rehoboam the third day  as the king had appoint  say  come to me again the third day  12  13 and the king answer the peopl rough  and forsook the old men  s counsel that they gave him  12  14 and spake to them after the counsel of the young men  say  my father made your yoke heavi  and i will add to your yoke  my father also chastis you with whip  but i will chastis you with scorpion  12  15 wherefor the king hearken not unto the peopl  for the caus was from the lord  that he might perform his say  which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonit unto jeroboam the son of nebat  12  16 so when all israel saw that the king hearken not unto them  the peopl answer the king  say  what portion have we in david  neither have we inherit in the son of jess  to your tent  o israel  now see to thine own hous  david  so israel depart unto their tent  12  17 but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the citi of judah  rehoboam reign over them  12  18 then king rehoboam sent adoram  who was over the tribut  and all israel stone him with stone  that he die  therefor king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot  to flee to jerusalem  12  19 so israel rebel against the hous of david unto this day  12  20 and it came to pass  when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again  that they sent and call him unto the congreg  and made him king over all israel  there was none that follow the hous of david  but the tribe of judah onli  12  21 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem  he assembl all the hous of judah  with the tribe of benjamin  an hundr and fourscor thousand chosen men  which were warrior  to fight against the hous of israel  to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon  12  22 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god  say  12  23 speak unto rehoboam  the son of solomon  king of judah  and unto all the hous of judah and benjamin  and to the remnant of the peopl  say  12  24 thus saith the lord  ye shall not go up  nor fight against your brethren the children of israel  return everi man to his hous  for this thing is from me  they hearken therefor to the word of the lord  and return to depart  accord to the word of the lord  12  25 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim  and dwelt therein  and went out from thenc  and built penuel  12  26 and jeroboam said in his heart  now shall the kingdom return to the hous of david  12  27 if this peopl go up to do sacrific in the hous of the lord at jerusalem  then shall the heart of this peopl turn again unto their lord  even unto rehoboam king of judah  and they shall kill me  and go again to rehoboam king of judah  12  28 whereupon the king took counsel  and made two calv of gold  and said unto them  it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem  behold thi god  o israel  which brought thee up out of the land of egypt  12  29 and he set the one in bethel  and the other put he in dan  12  30 and this thing becam a sin  for the peopl went to worship befor the one  even unto dan  12  31 and he made an hous of high place  and made priest of the lowest of the peopl  which were not of the son of levi  12  32 and jeroboam ordain a feast in the eighth month  on the fifteenth day of the month  like unto the feast that is in judah  and he offer upon the altar  so did he in bethel  sacrif unto the calv that he had made  and he place in bethel the priest of the high place which he had made  12  33 so he offer upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month  even in the month which he had devis of his own heart  and ordain a feast unto the children of israel  and he offer upon the altar  and burnt incens  13  1 and  behold  there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel  and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incens  13  2 and he cri against the altar in the word of the lord  and said  o altar  altar  thus saith the lord  behold  a child shall be born unto the hous of david  josiah by name  and upon thee shall he offer the priest of the high place that burn incens upon thee  and men  s bone shall be burnt upon thee  13  3 and he gave a sign the same day  say  this is the sign which the lord hath spoken  behold  the altar shall be rent  and the ash that are upon it shall be pour out  13  4 and it came to pass  when king jeroboam heard the say of the man of god  which had cri against the altar in bethel  that he put forth his hand from the altar  say  lay hold on him  and his hand  which he put forth against him  dri up  so that he could not pull it in again to him  13  5 the altar also was rent  and the ash pour out from the altar  accord to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord  13  6 and the king answer and said unto the man of god  intreat now the face of the lord thi god  and pray for me  that my hand may be restor me again  and the man of god besought the lord  and the king  s hand was restor him again  and becam as it was befor  13  7 and the king said unto the man of god  come home with me  and refresh thyself  and i will give thee a reward  13  8 and the man of god said unto the king  if thou wilt give me half thine hous  i will not go in with thee  neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place  13  9 for so was it charg me by the word of the lord  say  eat no bread  nor drink water  nor turn again by the same way that thou camest  13  10 so he went anoth way  and return not by the way that he came to bethel  13  11 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel  and his son came and told him all the work that the man of god had done that day in bethel  the word which he had spoken unto the king  them they told also to their father  13  12 and their father said unto them  what way went he  for his son had seen what way the man of god went  which came from judah  13  13 and he said unto his son  saddl me the ass  so they saddl him the ass  and he rode thereon  13  14 and went after the man of god  and found him sit under an oak  and he said unto him  art thou the man of god that camest from judah  and he said  i am  13  15 then he said unto him  come home with me  and eat bread  13  16 and he said  i may not return with thee  nor go in with thee  neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place  13  17 for it was said to me by the word of the lord  thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there  nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest  13  18 he said unto him  i am a prophet also as thou art  and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord  say  bring him back with thee into thine hous  that he may eat bread and drink water  but he lie unto him  13  19 so he went back with him  and did eat bread in his hous  and drank water  13  20 and it came to pass  as they sat at the tabl  that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back  13  21 and he cri unto the man of god that came from judah  say  thus saith the lord  forasmuch as thou hast disobey the mouth of the lord  and hast not kept the command which the lord thi god command thee  13  22 but camest back  and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place  of the which the lord did say to thee  eat no bread  and drink no water  thi carcas shall not come unto the sepulchr of thi father  13  23 and it came to pass  after he had eaten bread  and after he had drunk  that he saddl for him the ass  to wit  for the prophet whom he had brought back  13  24 and when he was gone  a lion met him by the way  and slew him  and his carcas was cast in the way  and the ass stood by it  the lion also stood by the carcas  13  25 and  behold  men pass by  and saw the carcas cast in the way  and the lion stand by the carcas  and they came and told it in the citi where the old prophet dwelt  13  26 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof  he said  it is the man of god  who was disobedi unto the word of the lord  therefor the lord hath deliv him unto the lion  which hath torn him  and slain him  accord to the word of the lord  which he spake unto him  13  27 and he spake to his son  say  saddl me the ass  and they saddl him  13  28 and he went and found his carcas cast in the way  and the ass and the lion stand by the carcas  the lion had not eaten the carcas  nor torn the ass  13  29 and the prophet took up the carcas of the man of god  and laid it upon the ass  and brought it back  and the old prophet came to the citi  to mourn and to buri him  13  30 and he laid his carcas in his own grave  and they mourn over him  say  ala  my brother  13  31 and it came to pass  after he had buri him  that he spake to his son  say  when i am dead  then buri me in the sepulchr wherein the man of god is buri  lay my bone besid his bone  13  32 for the say which he cri by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel  and against all the hous of the high place which are in the citi of samaria  shall sure come to pass  13  33 after this thing jeroboam return not from his evil way  but made again of the lowest of the peopl priest of the high place  whosoev would  he consecr him  and he becam one of the priest of the high place  13  34 and this thing becam sin unto the hous of jeroboam  even to cut it off  and to destroy it from off the face of the earth  14  1 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick  14  2 and jeroboam said to his wife  aris  i pray thee  and disguis thyself  that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam  and get thee to shiloh  behold  there is ahijah the prophet  which told me that i should be king over this peopl  14  3 and take with thee ten loav  and cracknel  and a cruse of honey  and go to him  he shall tell thee what shall becom of the child  14  4 and jeroboam  s wife did so  and aros  and went to shiloh  and came to the hous of ahijah  but ahijah could not see  for his eye were set by reason of his age  14  5 and the lord said unto ahijah  behold  the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son  for he is sick  thus and thus shalt thou say unto her  for it shall be  when she cometh in  that she shall feign herself to be anoth woman  14  6 and it was so  when ahijah heard the sound of her feet  as she came in at the door  that he said  come in  thou wife of jeroboam  whi feignest thou thyself to be anoth  for i am sent to thee with heavi tide  14  7 go  tell jeroboam  thus saith the lord god of israel  forasmuch as i exalt thee from among the peopl  and made thee princ over my peopl israel  14  8 and rent the kingdom away from the hous of david  and gave it thee  and yet thou hast not been as my servant david  who kept my command  and who follow me with all his heart  to do that onli which was right in mine eye  14  9 but hast done evil abov all that were befor thee  for thou hast gone and made thee other god  and molten imag  to provok me to anger  and hast cast me behind thi back  14  10 therefor  behold  i will bring evil upon the hous of jeroboam  and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall  and him that is shut up and left in israel  and will take away the remnant of the hous of jeroboam  as a man taketh away dung  till it be all gone  14  11 him that dieth of jeroboam in the citi shall the dog eat  and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat  for the lord hath spoken it  14  12 aris thou therefor  get thee to thine own hous  and when thi feet enter into the citi  the child shall die  14  13 and all israel shall mourn for him  and buri him  for he onli of jeroboam shall come to the grave  becaus in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the hous of jeroboam  14  14 moreov the lord shall rais him up a king over israel  who shall cut off the hous of jeroboam that day  but what  even now  14  15 for the lord shall smite israel  as a reed is shaken in the water  and he shall root up israel out of this good land  which he gave to their father  and shall scatter them beyond the river  becaus they have made their grove  provok the lord to anger  14  16 and he shall give israel up becaus of the sin of jeroboam  who did sin  and who made israel to

peradventur we may find grass to save the hors and mule aliv  that we lose not all the beast  18  6 so they divid the land between them to pass throughout it  ahab went one way by himself  and obadiah went anoth way by himself  18  7 and as obadiah was in the way  behold  elijah met him  and he knew him  and fell on his face  and said  art thou that my lord elijah  18  8 and he answer him  i am  go

nation or kingdom  whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee  and when they said  he is not there  he took an oath of the kingdom and nation  that they found thee not  18  11 and now thou sayest  go  tell thi lord  behold  elijah is here  18  12 and it shall come to pass  as soon as i am gone from thee  that the spirit of the lord shall carri thee whither i know not  and so when i come and tell

as the lord of host liveth  befor whom i stand  i will sure shew myself unto him to day  18  16 so obadiah went to meet ahab  and told him  and ahab went to meet elijah  18  17 and it came to pass  when ahab saw elijah  that ahab said unto him  art thou he that troubleth israel  18  18 and he answer  i have not troubl israel  but thou  and thi father  s hous  in that ye have forsaken the command

ye between two opinion  if the lord be god  follow him  but if baal  then follow him  and the peopl answer him not a word  18  22 then said elijah unto the peopl  i  even i onli  remain a prophet of

answereth by fire  let him be god  and all the peopl answer and said  it is well spoken  18  25 and elijah said unto the prophet of baal  choos you one bullock for yourselv  and dress it first  for ye are mani  and call on the name of your god  but put no fire under  18  26 and they took the bullock which was given them  and they dress it  and call on the name of baal from morn even until noon  say  o baal  hear us  but there was no voic  nor ani that answer  and they leap upon the altar which was made  18  27 and it came to pass at noon  that elijah mock them  and said  cri aloud  for he is a god  either he is talk  or he is pursu  or he is in a journey  or peradventur he sleepeth  and must be awak  18  28 and they cri aloud  and cut themselv after their manner with knive and lancet  till the blood gush out upon them  18  29 and it came to pass  when midday was past  and they prophesi until the time of the offer of the even sacrific  that there was neither voic  nor ani to answer  nor ani that regard  18  30 and elijah said unto all the peopl  come near unto me  and all the peopl came near unto him  and he repair the altar of the lord that was broken down  18  31 and elijah took twelv stone  accord to the number of the tribe of the son of jacob  unto whom the word of the lord came  say  israel shall be thi name  18  32 and with the stone he built an altar in the name of the

prophet came near  and said  lord god of abraham  isaac  and of israel  let it be known this day that thou art god in israel  and that i am thi servant  and that i have done all these thing at thi word  18  37 hear me  o lord  hear me  that this peopl may know that thou art the lord god  and that thou hast turn their heart back again  18  38 then the fire of the lord fell  and consum the burnt sacrific  and the wood  and the stone  and the dust  and lick up the water that was in the trench  18  39 and when all the peopl saw it  they fell on their face  and they said  the lord  he is the god  the lord  he is the god  18  40 and elijah said unto them  take the prophet of baal  let not one of them escap  and they took them  and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon  and slew them there  18  41 and elijah said unto ahab  get thee up  eat and drink  for there is a sound of abund of rain  18  42 so ahab went up to eat and to drink  and elijah went up to the top of carmel  and he cast himself down upon the earth  and put his face between his knee  18  43 and said to his servant  go up now  look toward the sea  and he went up  and look  and said  there is noth  and he said  go

behold  the word of the lord came to him  and he said unto him  what doest thou here  elijah  19  10 and he said  i have been veri jealous for the lord god of host  for the children of israel have forsaken thi coven  thrown down thine altar  and slain thi prophet with the sword  and i  even i onli  am left  and they seek my life  to take it away  19  11 and he said  go forth  and stand upon the

and they seek my life  to take it away  19  15 and the lord said unto him  go  return on thi way to the wilder of damascus  and when thou comest  anoint hazael to be king over syria  19  16 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel  and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thi room  19  17 and it shall come to pass  that him that

king  then they carri him forth out of the citi  and stone him with stone  that he die  21  14 then they sent to jezebel  say  naboth is stone  and is dead  21  15 and it came to pass  when jezebel heard that naboth was stone  and was dead  that jezebel said to ahab  aris  take possess of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelit  which he refus to give thee for money  for naboth is not aliv  but dead  21  16 and it came to pass  when ahab heard that naboth was dead  that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelit  to take possess of it  21  17 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbit  say  21  18 aris  go down to meet ahab king of israel  which is in samaria  behold  he is in the vineyard of naboth  whither he is gone down to possess it  21  19 and thou shalt speak unto him  say  thus saith the lord  hast thou kill  and also taken possess  and thou shalt speak unto him  say  thus saith the lord  in the place where dog lick the blood of naboth shall dog lick thi blood  even thine  21  20 and ahab said to elijah  hast thou found me  o mine enemi  and he answer  i have found thee  becaus thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord  21  21 behold  i will bring evil upon thee  and will take away thi poster  and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall  and him that is shut up and left in israel  21  22 and will make thine hous like the hous of jeroboam the son of nebat  and like the hous of baasha the son of ahijah  for the provoc wherewith thou hast provok me to anger  and made israel to sin  21  23 and of jezebel also spake the lord  say  the dog shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel  21  24 him that dieth of ahab in the citi the dog shall eat  and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the air eat  21  25 but there was none like unto ahab  which did sell himself to work wicked in the sight of the lord  whom jezebel his wife stir up  21  26 and he did veri abomin in follow idol  accord to all thing as did the amorit  whom the lord cast out befor the children of israel  21  27 and it came to pass  when ahab heard those word  that he rent his cloth  and put sackcloth upon his flesh  and fast  and lay in sackcloth  and went soft  21  28 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbit  say  21  29 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself befor me  becaus he humbleth himself befor me  i will not bring the evil in his day  but in his son  s day will i bring the evil upon his hous  22  1 and they continu three year without war between syria and israel  22  2 and it came to pass in the third year  that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel  22  3 and the king of israel said unto his servant  know ye that ramoth in gilead is our  and we be still  and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria  22  4 and he said unto jehoshaphat  wilt thou go with me to battl to ramothgilead  and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel  i am as thou art  my peopl as thi peopl  my hors as thi hors  22  5 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel  enquir  i pray thee  at the word of the lord to day  22  6 then the king of israel gather the prophet togeth  about four hundr men  and said unto them  shall i go against ramothgilead to battl  or shall i forbear  and they said  go up  for the lord shall deliv it into the hand of the king  22  7 and jehoshaphat said  is there not here a prophet of the lord besid  that we might enquir of him  22  8 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  there is yet one man  micaiah the son of imlah  by whom we may enquir of the lord  but i hate him  for he doth not prophesi good concern me  but evil  and jehoshaphat said  let not the king say so  22  9 then the king of israel call an offic  and said  hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah  22  10 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne  have put on their robe  in a void place in the entranc of the gate of samaria  and all the prophet prophesi befor them  22  11 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horn of iron  and he said  thus saith the lord  with these shalt thou push the syrian  until thou have consum them  22  12 and all the prophet prophesi so  say  go up to ramothgilead  and prosper  for the lord shall deliv it into the king  s hand  22  13 and the messeng that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him  say  behold now  the word of the prophet declar good unto the king with one mouth  let thi word  i pray thee  be like the word of one of them  and speak that which is good  22  14 and micaiah said  as the lord liveth  what the lord saith unto me  that will i speak  22  15 so he came to the king  and the king said unto him  micaiah  shall we go against ramothgilead to battl  or shall we forbear  and he answer him  go  and prosper  for the lord shall deliv it into the hand of the king  22  16 and the king said unto him  how mani time shall i adjur thee that thou tell me noth but that which is true in the name of the lord  22  17 and he said  i saw all israel scatter upon the hill  as sheep that have not a shepherd  and the lord said  these have no master  let them return everi man to his hous in peac  22  18 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee that he would prophesi no good concern me  but evil  22  19 and he said  hear thou therefor the word of the lord  i saw the lord sit on his throne  and all the host of heaven stand by him on his right hand and on his left  22  20 and the lord said  who shall persuad ahab  that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead  and one said on this manner  and anoth said on that manner  22  21 and there came forth a spirit  and stood befor the lord  and said  i will persuad him  22  22 and the lord said unto him  wherewith  and he said  i will go forth  and i will be a lie spirit in the mouth of all his prophet  and he said  thou shalt persud him  and prevail also  go forth  and do so  22  23 now therefor  behold  the lord hath put a lie spirit in the mouth of all these thi prophet  and the lord hath spoken evil concern thee  22  24 but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near  and smote micaiah on the cheek  and said  which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee  22  25 and micaiah said  behold  thou shalt see in that day  when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself  22  26 and the king of israel said  take micaiah  and carri him back unto amon the governor of the citi  and to joash the king  s son  22  27 and say  thus saith the king  put this fellow in the prison  and feed him with bread of afflict and with water of afflict  until i come in peac  22  28 and micaiah said  if thou return at all in peac  the lord hath not spoken by me  and he said  hearken  o peopl  everi one of you  22  29 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead  22  30 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will disguis myself  and enter into the battl  but put thou on thi robe  and the king of israel disguis himself  and went into the battl  22  31 but the king of syria command his thirti and two captain

that they turn back from pursu him  22  34 and a certain man drew a bow at a ventur  and smote the king of israel between the joint of the har  wherefor he said unto the driver of his chariot  turn thine hand  and carri me out of the host  for i am wound  22  35 and the battl increas that day  and the king was stay up in his chariot against the syrian  and die at even  and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot  22  36 and there went a proclam throughout the host about the go down of the sun  say  everi man to his citi  and everi man to his own countri  22  37 so the king die  and was brought to samaria  and they buri the king in samaria  22  38 and one wash the chariot in the pool of samaria  and the dog lick up his blood  and they wash his armour  accord unto

he did evil in the sight of the lord  and walk in the way of his father  and in the way of his mother  and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat  who made israel to sin  22  53 for he serv baal  and worship him  and provok to anger the lord god of israel  accord to all that his father had done  the first book of the king common call  the fourth book of the king 1  1 then moab rebel against israel

is not a god in israel  that ye go to enquir of baalzebub the god of ekron  1  4 now therefor thus saith the lord  thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up  but shalt sure die  and elijah depart  1  5 and when the messeng turn back unto him  he said unto them  whi are ye now turn back  1  6 and they said unto him  there came a man up to meet us  and said unto us  go  turn

answer him  he was an hairi man  and girt with a girdl of leather about his loin  and he said  it is elijah the tishbit  1  9 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifti with his fifti  and he went

and they two stood by jordan  2  8 and elijah took his mantl  and wrap it togeth  and smote the water  and they were divid hither and thither  so that they two went over on dri ground  2  9 and it came to pass  when they were gone over  that elijah said unto elisha  ask what i shall do for thee  befor i be taken away from thee  and elisha said  i pray thee  let a doubl portion of thi spirit be upon me  2  10 and he said  thou hast ask a hard thing  nevertheless  if thou see me when i am taken from thee  it shall be so unto thee  but if not  it shall not be so  2  11 and it came to pass  as they still went on  and talk  that  behold  there appear a chariot of fire  and hors of fire  and part them both asund  and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven  2  12 and elisha saw it  and he

when he also had smitten the water  they part hither and thither  and elisha went over  2  15 and when the son of the prophet which were to view at jericho saw him  they said  the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha  and they came to meet him  and bow themselv to the ground befor him  2  16 and they said unto him  behold now  there be with thi servant fifti strong men  let them go  we pray thee  and seek thi master  lest peradventur the spirit of the lord hath taken him up  and cast him upon some mountain  or into some valley  and he said  ye shall not send  2  17 and when they urg him till he was asham  he said  send  they sent therefor fifti men  and they sought three day  but found him not  2  18 and when they came again to him   for he tarri at jericho  he said unto them  did i not say unto you  go not  2  19 and the men of the citi said unto elisha  behold  i pray thee  the situat of this citi is pleasant  as my lord seeth  but the water is naught  and the ground barren  2  20 and he said  bring me a new cruse  and put salt therein  and they brought it to him  2  21 and he went forth unto the spring of the water  and cast the salt in there  and said  thus saith the lord  i have heal these water  there shall not be from thenc ani more death or barren land  2  22 so the water were heal unto this day  accord to the say of elisha which he spake  2  23 and he went up from thenc unto bethel  and as he was go up by the way  there came forth littl children out of the citi  and mock him  and said unto him  go up  thou bald head  go up  thou bald head  2  24 and he turn back  and look on them  and curs them in the name of the lord  and there came forth two she bear out of the wood  and tare forti and two children of them  2  25 and he went from thenc to mount carmel  and from thenc he return to samaria  3  1 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah  and reign twelv year  3  2 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord  but not like his father  and like his mother  for he put away the imag of baal that his father had made  3  3 nevertheless he cleav unto the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat  which made israel to sin  he depart not therefrom  3  4 and mesha king of moab was a sheepmast  and render unto the king of israel an hundr thousand lamb  and an hundr thousand ram  with the wool  3  5 but it came to pass  when ahab was dead  that the king of moab rebel against the king of israel  3  6 and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time  and number all israel  3  7 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah  say  the king of moab hath rebel against me  wilt thou go with me against moab to battl  and he said  i will go up  i am as thou art  my peopl as thi peopl  and my hors as thi hors  3  8 and he said  which way shall we go up  and he answer  the way through the wilder of edom  3  9 so the king of israel went  and the king of judah  and the king of edom  and they fetch a compass of seven day  journey  and there was no water for the host  and for the cattl that follow them  3  10 and the king of israel said  ala  that the lord hath call these three king togeth  to deliv them into the hand of moab  3  11 but jehoshaphat said  is there not here a prophet of the lord  that we may enquir of the lord by him  and one of the king of israel  s servant answer and said  here is elisha the son of shaphat  which pour water on the hand of elijah  3  12 and jehoshaphat said  the word of the lord is with him  so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him  3  13 and elisha said unto the king of israel  what have i to do with thee  get thee to the prophet of thi father  and to the prophet of thi mother  and the king of israel said unto him  nay  for the lord hath call these three king togeth  to deliv them into the hand of moab  3  14 and elisha said  as the lord of host liveth  befor whom i stand  sure  were it not that i regard the presenc of jehoshaphat the king of judah  i would not look toward thee  nor see thee  3  15 but now bring me a minstrel  and it came to pass  when the minstrel play  that the hand of the lord came upon him  3  16 and he said  thus saith the lord  make this valley full of ditch  3  17 for thus saith the lord  ye shall not see wind  neither shall ye see rain  yet that valley shall be fill with water  that ye may drink  both ye  and your cattl  and your beast  3  18 and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord  he will deliv the moabit also into your hand  3  19 and ye shall smite everi fenc citi  and everi choic citi  and shall fell everi good tree  and stop all well of water  and mar everi good piec of land with stone  3  20 and it came to pass in the morn  when the meat offer was offer  that  behold  there came water by the way of edom  and the countri was fill with water  3  21 and when all the moabit heard that the king were come up to fight against them  they gather all that were abl to put on armour  and upward  and stood in the border  3  22 and they rose up earli in the morn  and the sun shone upon the water  and the moabit saw the water on the other side as red as blood  3  23 and they said  this is blood  the king are sure slain  and they have smitten one anoth  now therefor  moab  to the spoil  3  24 and when they came to the camp of israel  the israelit rose up and smote the moabit  so that they fled befor them  but they went forward smite the moabit  even in their countri  3  25 and they beat down the citi  and on everi good piec of land cast everi man his stone  and fill it  and they stop all the well of water  and fell all the good tree  onli in kirharaseth left they the stone thereof  howbeit the slinger went about it  and smote it  3  26 and when the king of moab saw that the battl was too sore for him  he took with him seven hundr men that drew sword  to break through even unto the king of edom  but they could not  3  27 then he took his eldest son that should have reign in his stead  and offer him for a burnt offer upon the wall  and there was great indign against israel  and they depart from him  and return to their own land  4  1 now there cri a certain woman of the wive of the son of the prophet unto elisha  say  thi servant my husband is dead  and thou knowest that thi servant did fear the lord  and the creditor is come to take unto him my two son to be bondmen  4  2 and elisha said unto her  what shall i do for thee  tell me  what hast thou in the hous  and she said  thine handmaid hath not ani thing in the hous  save a pot of oil  4  3 then he said  go  borrow thee vessel abroad of all thi neighbour  even empti vessel  borrow not a few  4  4 and when thou art come in  thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thi son  and shalt pour out into all those vessel  and thou shalt set asid that which is full  4  5 so she went from him  and shut the door upon her and upon her son  who brought the vessel to her  and she pour out  4  6 and it came to pass  when the vessel were full  that she said unto her son  bring me yet a vessel  and he said unto her  there is not a vessel more  and the oil stay  4  7 then she came and told the man of god  and he said  go  sell the oil  and pay thi debt  and live thou and thi children of the rest  4  8 and it fell on a day  that elisha pass to shunem  where was a great woman  and she constrain him to eat bread  and so it was  that as oft as he pass by  he turn in thither to eat bread  4  9 and she said unto her husband  behold now  i perceiv that this is an holi man of god  which passeth by us continu  4  10 let us make a littl chamber  i pray thee  on the wall  and let us set for him there a bed  and a tabl  and a stool  and a candlestick  and it shall be  when he cometh to us  that he shall turn in thither  4  11 and it fell on a day  that he came thither  and he turn into the chamber  and lay there  4  12 and he said to gehazi his servant  call this shunammit  and when he had call her  she stood befor him  4  13 and he said unto him  say now unto her  behold  thou hast been care for us with all this care  what is to

answer  verili she hath no child  and her husband is old  4  15 and he said  call her  and when he had call her  she stood in the door  4  16 and he said  about this season  accord to the time of life  thou shalt embrac a son  and she said  nay  my lord  thou man of god  do not lie unto thine handmaid  4  17 and the woman conceiv  and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her  accord to the time of life  4  18 and when the child was grown  it fell on a day  that he went out to his father to the reaper  4  19 and he said unto his father  my head  my head  and he said to a lad  carri him to his mother  4  20 and when he had taken him  and brought him to his mother  he sat on her knee till noon  and then die  4  21 and she went up  and laid him on the bed of the man of god  and shut the door upon him  and went out  4  22 and she call unto her husband  and said  send me  i pray thee  one of the young men  and one of the ass  that i may run to the man of god  and come

forward  slack not thi ride for me  except i bid thee  4  25 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel  and it came to pass  when the man of god saw her afar off  that he said to gehazi

hoshea the son of elah made a conspiraci against pekah the son of remaliah  and smote him  and slew him  and reign in his stead  in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah  15  31 and the rest of the act of pekah  and all that he did  behold  they are written in the book of the chronicl of the king of israel  15  32 in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel began jotham

incens still in the high place  he built the higher gate of the hous of the lord  15  36 now the rest of the act of jotham  and all that he did  are they not written in the book of the chronicl of the king of judah  15  37 in those day the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria  and pekah the son of remaliah  15  38 and jotham slept with his father  and was buri with his father in the citi of david his father  and ahaz his son reign in his stead  16  1 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign  16  2 twenti year old was ahaz when he began to reign  and reign sixteen year in jerusalem  and did not that which was right in the sight of the lord his god  like david his father  16  3 but he walk in the way of the king

high place  and on the hill  and under everi green tree  16  5 then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war  and they besieg ahaz  but could not overcom him  16  6 at that time rezin king of syria recov elath to syria  and drave the jew from elath  and the syrian came to elath  and dwelt there unto this day  16  7 so ahaz sent messeng to tiglathpiles king of assyria  say  i am thi servant and thi son  come up  and save me out of the hand of the king of syria  and out of the hand of the king of israel  which rise up against me  16  8 and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the hous of the lord  and in the treasur of the king  s hous  and sent it for a present to the king of assyria  16  9 and the king of assyria hearken unto him  for the king of assyria went up against damascus  and took it  and carri the peopl of it captiv to kir  and slew rezin  16  10 and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpiles king of assyria  and saw an altar that was at damascus  and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar  and the pattern of it  accord to all the workmanship thereof  16  11 and urijah the priest built an altar accord to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus  so urijah the priest made it against king ahaz came from damascus  16  12 and when the king was come from damascus  the king saw the altar  and the king approach to the altar  and offer thereon  16  13 and he burnt his burnt offer and his meat offer  and pour his drink offer  and sprinkl the blood of his peac

altar shall be for me to enquir by  16  16 thus did urijah the priest  accord to all that king ahaz command  16  17 and king ahaz cut off the border of the base  and remov the laver from off them  and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it  and put it upon the pavement of stone  16  18 and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the hous  and the king  s entri without  turn he from the hous of the lord for the king of assyria  16  19 now the rest of the act of ahaz which he did  are they not written in the book of the chronicl of the king of judah  16  20 and ahaz slept with his father  and was buri with his father in the citi of david  and hezekiah his son reign in his stead  17  1 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine year  17  2 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord  but not as the king of israel that were befor him  17  3 against him came up shalmanes king of assyria  and hoshea becam his servant  and gave him present  17  4 and the king of assyria found conspiraci in hoshea  for he had sent messeng to so king of egypt  and brought no present to the king of assyria  as he had done year by year  therefor the king of assyria shut him up  and bound him in prison  17  5 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land  and went up to samaria  and besieg it three year  17  6 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria  and carri israel away into assyria  and place them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan  and in the citi of the mede  17  7 for so it was  that the children of israel had sin against the lord their god  which had brought them up out of the land of egypt  from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt  and had fear other god  17  8 and walk in the statut of the heathen  whom the lord cast out from befor the children of israel  and of the king of israel  which they had made  17  9 and the children of israel did secret those thing that were not right against the lord their god  and they built them high place in all their citi  from the tower of the watchmen to the fenc citi  17  10 and they set them up imag and grove in everi high hill  and under everi green tree  17  11 and there they burnt incens in all the high place  as did the heathen whom the lord carri away befor them  and wrought wick thing to provok the lord to anger  17  12 for they serv idol  whereof the lord had said unto them  ye shall not do this thing  17  13 yet the lord testifi against israel  and against judah  by all the prophet  and by all the seer  say  turn ye from your evil way  and keep my command and my statut  accord to all the law which i command your father  and which i sent to you by my servant the prophet  17  14 notwithstand they would not hear  but harden their neck  like to the neck of their father  that did not believ in the lord their god  17  15 and they reject his statut  and his coven that he made with their father  and his testimoni which he testifi against them  and they follow vaniti  and becam vain  and went after the heathen that were round about them  concern whom the lord had charg them  that they should not do like them  17  16 and they left all the command of the lord their god  and made them molten imag  even two calv  and made a grove  and worship all the host of heaven  and serv baal  17  17 and they caus their son and their daughter to pass through the fire  and use divin and enchant  and sold themselv to do evil in the sight of the lord  to provok him to anger  17  18 therefor the lord was veri angri with israel  and remov them out of his sight  there was none left but the tribe of judah onli  17  19 also judah kept not the command of the lord their god  but walk in the statut of israel which they made  17  20 and the lord reject all the seed of israel  and afflict them  and deliv them into the hand of spoiler  until he had cast them out of his sight  17  21 for he rent israel from the hous of david  and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king  and jeroboam drave israel from follow the lord  and made them sin a great sin  17  22 for the children of israel walk in all the sin of jeroboam which he did  they depart not from them  17  23 until the lord remov israel out of his sight  as he had said by all his servant the prophet  so was israel carri away out of their own land to assyria unto this day  17  24 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon  and from cuthah  and from ava  and from hamath  and from sepharvaim  and place them in the citi of samaria instead of the children of israel  and they possess samaria  and dwelt in the citi thereof  17  25 and so it was at the begin of their dwell there  that they fear not the lord  therefor the lord sent lion among them  which slew some of them  17  26 wherefor they spake to the king of assyria  say  the nation which thou hast remov  and place in the citi of samaria  know not the manner of the god of the land  therefor he hath sent lion among them  and  behold  they slay them  becaus they know not the manner of the god of the land  17  27 then the king of assyria command  say  carri thither one of the priest whom ye brought from thenc  and let them go and dwell there  and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land  17  28 then one of the priest whom they had carri away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel  and taught them how they should fear the lord  17  29 howbeit everi nation made god of their own  and put them in the hous of the high place which the samaritan had made  everi nation in their citi wherein they dwelt  17  30 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth  and the men of cuth made nergal  and the men of hamath made ashima  17  31 and the avit made nibhaz and tartak  and the sepharvit burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech  the god of sepharvaim  17  32 so they fear the lord  and made unto themselv of the lowest of them priest of the high place  which sacrif for them in the hous of the high place  17  33 they fear the lord  and serv their own god  after the manner of the nation whom they carri away from thenc  17  34 unto this day they do after the former manner  they fear not the lord  neither do they after their statut  or after their ordin  or after the law and command which the lord command the children of jacob  whom he name israel  17  35 with whom the lord had made a coven  and charg them  say  ye shall not fear other god  nor bow yourselv to them  nor serv them  nor sacrific to them  17  36 but the lord  who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretch out arm  him shall ye fear  and him shall ye worship  and to him shall ye do sacrific  17  37 and the statut  and the ordin  and the law  and the command  which he wrote for you  ye shall observ to do for evermor  and ye shall not fear other god  17  38 and the coven that i have made with you ye shall not forget  neither shall ye fear other god  17  39 but the lord your god ye shall fear  and he shall deliv you out of the hand of all your enemi  17  40 howbeit they did not hearken  but they did after their former manner  17  41 so these nation fear the lord  and serv their graven imag  both their children  and their children  s children  as did their father  so do they unto this day  18  1 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel  that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign  18  2 twenti and five year old was he when he began to reign  and he reign twenti and nine year in jerusalem  his mother  s name also was abi  the daughter of zachariah  18  3 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord  accord to all that david his father did  18  4 he remov the high place  and brake the imag  and cut down the grove  and brake in piec the brasen serpent that mose had made  for unto those day the children of israel did burn incens to it  and he call it nehushtan  18  5 he trust in the lord god of israel  so that after him was none like him among all the king of judah  nor ani that were befor him  18  6 for he clave to the lord  and depart not from follow him  but kept his command  which the lord command mose  18  7 and the lord was with him  and he prosper whithersoev he went forth  and he rebel against the king of assyria  and serv him not  18  8 he smote the philistin  even unto gaza  and the border thereof  from the tower of the watchmen to the fenc citi  18  9 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah  which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel  that shalmanes king of assyria came up against samaria  and besieg it  18  10 and at the end of three year they took it  even in the sixth year of hezekiah  that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel  samaria was taken  18  11 and the king of assyria did carri away israel unto assyria  and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan  and in the citi of the mede  18  12 becaus they obey not the voic of the lord their god  but transgress his coven  and all that mose the servant of the lord command  and would not hear them  nor do them  18  13 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenc citi of judah  and took them  18  14 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish  say  i have offend  return from me  that which thou puttest on me will i bear  and the king of assyria appoint unto hezekiah king of judah three hundr talent of silver and thirti talent of gold  18  15 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the hous of the lord  and in the treasur of the king  s hous  18  16 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the door of the templ of the lord  and from the pillar which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid  and gave it to the king of assyria  18  17 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsari and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem  and they went up and came to jerusalem  and when they were come up  they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool  which is in the highway of the fuller  s field  18  18 and when they had call to the king  there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah  which was over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah the son of asaph the record  18  19 and rabshakeh said unto them  speak ye now to hezekiah  thus saith the great king  the king of assyria  what confid is this wherein thou trustest  18  20 thou sayest   but they are but vain word  i have counsel and strength for the war  now on whom dost thou trust  that thou rebellest against me  18  21 now  behold  thou trustest upon the staff of this bruis reed  even upon egypt  on which if a man lean  it will go into his hand  and pierc it  so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him  18  22 but if ye say unto me  we trust in the lord our god  is not that he  whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away  and hath said to judah and jerusalem  ye shall worship befor this altar in jerusalem  18  23 now therefor  i pray thee  give pledg to my lord the king of assyria  and i will deliv thee two thousand hors  if thou be abl on thi part to set rider upon them  18  24 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master  s servant  and put thi trust on egypt for chariot and for horsemen  18  25 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it  the lord said to me  go up against this land  and destroy it  18  26 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah  and shebna  and joah  unto rabshakeh  speak  i pray thee  to thi servant in the syrian languag  for we understand it  and talk not with us in the jew  languag in the ear of the peopl that are on the wall  18  27 but rabshakeh said unto them  hath my master sent me to thi master  and to thee  to speak these word  hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall  that they may eat their own dung  and drink their own piss with you  18  28 then rabshakeh stood and cri with a loud voic in the jew  languag  and spake  say  hear the word of the great king  the king of assyria  18  29 thus saith the king  let not hezekiah deceiv you  for he shall not be abl to deliv you out of his hand  18  30 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord  say  the lord will sure deliv us  and this citi shall not be deliv into the hand of the king of assyria  18  31 hearken not to hezekiah  for thus saith the king of assyria  make an agreement with me by a present  and come out to me  and then eat ye everi man of his own vine  and everi one of his fig tree  and drink ye everi one the water of his cistern  18  32 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land  a land of corn and wine  a land of bread and vineyard  a land of oil oliv and of honey  that ye may live  and not die  and hearken not unto hezekiah  when he persuadeth you  say  the lord will deliv us  18  33 hath ani of the god of the nation deliv at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria  18  34 where are the god of hamath  and of arpad  where are the god of sepharvaim  hena  and ivah  have they deliv samaria out of mine hand  18  35 who are they among all the god of the countri  that have deliv their countri out of mine hand  that the lord should deliv jerusalem out of mine hand  18  36 but the peopl held their peac  and answer him not a word  for the king  s command was  say  answer him not  18  37 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah  which was over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah the son of asaph the record  to hezekiah with their cloth rent  and told him the word of rabshakeh  19  1 and it came to pass  when king hezekiah heard it  that he rent his cloth  and cover himself with sackcloth  and went into the hous of the lord  19  2 and he sent eliakim  which was over the household  and shebna the scribe  and the elder of the priest  cover with sackcloth  to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz  19  3 and they said unto him  thus saith hezekiah  this day is a day of troubl  and of rebuk  and blasphemi  for the children are come to the birth  and there is not strength to bring forth  19  4 it may be the lord thi god will hear all the word of rabshakeh  whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the live god  and will reprov the word which the lord thi god hath heard  wherefor lift up thi prayer for the remnant that are left  19  5 so the servant of king hezekiah came to isaiah  19  6 and isaiah said unto them  thus shall ye say to your master  thus saith the lord  be not afraid of the word which thou hast heard  with which the servant of the king of assyria have blasphem me  19  7 behold  i will send a blast upon him  and he shall hear a rumour  and shall return to his own land  and i will caus him to fall by the sword in his own land  19  8 so rabshakeh return  and found the king of assyria war against libnah  for he had heard that he was depart from lachish  19  9 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia  behold  he is come out to fight against thee  he sent messeng again unto hezekiah  say  19  10 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah  say  let not thi god in whom thou trustest deceiv thee  say  jerusalem shall not be deliv into the hand of the king of assyria  19  11 behold  thou hast heard what the king of assyria have done to all land  by destroy them utter  and shalt thou be deliv  19  12 have the god of the nation deliv them which my father have destroy  as gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and the children of eden which were in thelasar  19  13 where is the king of hamath  and the king of arpad  and the king of the citi of sepharvaim  of hena  and ivah  19  14 and hezekiah receiv the letter of the hand of the messeng  and read it  and hezekiah went up into the hous of the lord  and spread it befor the lord  19  15 and hezekiah pray befor the lord  and said  o lord god of israel  which dwellest between the cherubim  thou art the god  even thou alon  of all the kingdom of the earth  thou hast made heaven and earth  19  16 lord  bow down thine ear  and hear  open  lord  thine eye  and see  and hear the word of sennacherib  which hath sent him to reproach the live god  19  17 of a truth  lord  the king of assyria have destroy the nation and their land  19  18 and have cast their god into the fire  for they were no god  but the work of men  s hand  wood and stone  therefor they have destroy them  19  19 now therefor  o lord our god  i beseech thee  save thou us out of his hand  that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord god  even thou onli  19  20 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah  say  thus saith the lord god of israel  that which thou hast pray to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard  19  21 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concern him  the virgin the daughter of zion hath despis thee  and laugh thee to scorn  the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee  19  22 whom hast thou

with the multitud of my chariot i am come up to the height of the mountain  to the side of lebanon  and will cut down the tall cedar tree thereof  and the choic fir tree thereof  and i will enter into

downward  and bear fruit upward  19  31 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant  and they that escap out of mount zion  the zeal of the lord of host shall do this  19  32 therefor thus saith the lord concern the king of assyria  he shall not come into this citi  nor shoot an arrow there  nor come befor it with shield  nor cast a bank against it  19  33 by the way that he came  by the same shall he return  and shall not come into this citi  saith the lord  19  34 for i will defend this citi  to save it  for mine own sake  and for my servant david  s sake  19  35 and it came to pass that night  that the angel of the lord went out  and smote in the camp of the assyrian an hundr fourscor and five thousand  and when they aros earli in the morn  behold  they were all dead corps  19  36 so sennacherib king of assyria depart  and went and return  and dwelt at nineveh  19  37 and it came to pass  as he was worship in the hous of nisroch his god  that adrammelech and sharez his son smote

sign shalt thou have of the lord  that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken  shall the shadow go forward ten degre  or go back ten degre  20  10 and hezekiah answer  it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degre  nay  but let the shadow return backward ten degre  20  11 and isaiah the prophet cri unto the lord  and he brought the shadow ten degre backward  by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz  20  12 at that time berodachbaladan  the son of baladan  king of babylon  sent letter and a present unto hezekiah  for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick  20  13 and hezekiah hearken unto them  and shew them all the hous of his precious thing  the silver  and the gold  and the spice  and the precious ointment  and all the hous of his armour  and all that was found in his treasur  there was noth in his hous  nor in all his dominion  that hezekiah shew them not  20  14 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah  and said unto him  what said these men  and from whenc came they unto thee  and hezekiah said  they are come from a far countri  even from babylon  20  15 and he said  what have they seen in thine hous  and hezekiah answer  all the thing that

over all the king from the river even unto the land of the philistin  and to the border of egypt  9  27 and the king made silver in jerusalem as stone  and cedar tree made he as the sycomor tree that are in the low plain in abund  9  28 and they brought unto solomon hors out of egypt  and out of all land  9  29 now the rest of the act of solomon  first and last  are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet  and in the propheci of ahijah the shilonit  and in the vision of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat  9  30 and solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel forti year  9  31 and solomon slept with his father  and he was buri in the citi of david his father  and rehoboam his son reign in his stead  10  1 and rehoboam went to shechem  for to shechem were all israel come to make him king  10  2 and it came to pass  when jeroboam the son of nebat  who was in egypt  whither he fled from the presenc of solomon the king  heard it  that jeroboam return out of egypt  10  3 and they sent and call him  so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam  say  10  4 thi father made our yoke grievous  now therefor eas thou somewhat the grievous servitud of thi father  and his heavi yoke that he put upon us  and we will serv thee  10  5 and he said unto them  come again unto me after three day  and the peopl depart  10  6 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood befor solomon his father while he yet live  say  what counsel give ye me to return answer to this peopl  10  7 and they spake unto him  say  if thou be kind to this peopl  and pleas them  and speak good word to them  they will be thi servant for ever  10  8 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him  and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him  that stood befor him  10  9 and he said unto them  what advic give ye that we may return answer to this peopl  which have spoken to me  say  eas somewhat the yoke that thi father did put upon us  10  10 and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him  say  thus shalt thou answer the peopl that spake unto thee  say  thi father made our yoke heavi  but make thou it somewhat lighter for us  thus shalt thou say unto them  my littl finger shall be thicker than my father  s loin  10  11 for wherea my father put a heavi yoke upon you  i will put more to your yoke  my father chastis

king answer them rough  and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men  10  14 and answer them after the advic of the young men  say  my father made your yoke heavi  but i will add thereto  my father chastis you with whip  but i will chastis you with scorpion  10  15 so the king hearken not unto the peopl  for the caus was of god  that the lord might perform his word  which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonit to jeroboam the son of nebat  10  16 and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them  the peopl answer the king  say  what portion have we in david  and we have none inherit in the son of jess  everi man to your tent  o israel  and now  david  see to thine own hous  so all israel went to their tent  10  17 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the citi of judah  rehoboam reign over them  10  18 then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribut  and the children of israel stone him with stone  that he die  but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot  to flee to jerusalem  10  19 and israel rebel against the hous of david unto this day  11  1 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem  he gather of the hous of judah and benjamin an hundr and fourscor thousand chosen men  which were warrior  to fight against israel  that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam  11  2 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god  say  11  3 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon  king of judah  and to all israel in judah and benjamin  say  11  4 thus saith the lord  ye shall not go up  nor fight against your brethren  return everi man to his hous  for this thing is done of me  and they obey the word of the lord  and return from go against jeroboam  11  5 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem  and built citi for defenc in judah  11  6 he built even bethlehem  and etam  and tekoa  11  7 and bethzur  and shoco  and adullam  11  8 and gath  and mareshah  and ziph  11  9 and adoraim  and lachish  and azekah  11  10 and zorah  and aijalon  and hebron  which are in judah and in benjamin fenc citi  11  11 and he fortifi the strong hold  and put captain in them  and store of victual  and of oil and wine  11  12 and in everi sever citi he put shield and spear  and made them exceed strong  have judah and benjamin on his side  11  13 and the priest and the levit that were in all israel resort to him out of all their coast  11  14 for the levit left their suburb and their possess  and came to judah and jerusalem  for jeroboam and his son had cast them off from execut the priest  s offic unto the lord  11  15 and he ordain him priest for the high place  and for the devil  and for the calv which he had made  11  16 and after them out of all the tribe of israel such as set their heart to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem  to sacrific unto the lord god of their father  11  17 so they strengthen the kingdom of judah  and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong  three year  for three year they walk in the way of david and solomon  11  18 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife  and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jess  11  19 which bare him children  jeush  and shamariah  and zaham  11  20 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom  which bare him abijah  and attai  and ziza  and shelomith  11  21 and rehoboam love maachah the daughter of absalom abov all his wive and his concubin   for he took eighteen wive  and threescor concubin  and begat twenti and eight son  and threescor daughter  11  22 and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief  to be ruler among his brethren  for he thought to make him king  11  23 and he dealt wise  and dispers of all his children throughout all the countri of judah and benjamin  unto everi fenc citi  and he gave them victual in abund  and he desir mani wive  12  1 and it came to pass  when rehoboam had establish the kingdom  and had strengthen himself  he forsook the law of the lord  and all israel with him  12  2 and it came to pass  that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  becaus they had transgress against the lord  12  3 with twelv hundr chariot  and threescor thousand horsemen  and the peopl were without number that came with him out of egypt  the lubim  the sukkiim  and the ethiopian  12  4 and he took the fenc citi which pertain to judah  and came to jerusalem  12  5 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam  and to the princ of judah  that were gather togeth to jerusalem becaus of shishak  and said unto them  thus saith the lord  ye have forsaken me  and therefor have i also left you in the hand of shishak  12  6 whereupon the princ of israel and the king humbl themselv  and they said  the lord is righteous  12  7 and when the lord saw that they humbl themselv  the word of the lord came to shemaiah  say  they have humbl themselv  therefor i will not destroy them  but i will grant them some deliver  and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak  12  8 nevertheless they shall be his servant  that they may know my servic  and the servic of the kingdom of the countri  12  9 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  and took away the treasur of the hous of the lord  and the treasur of the king  s hous  he took all  he carri away also the shield of gold which solomon had made  12  10 instead of which king rehoboam made shield of brass  and commit them to the hand of the chief of the guard  that kept the entranc of the king  s hous  12  11 and when the king enter into the hous of the lord  the guard came and fetch them  and brought them again into the guard chamber  12  12 and when he humbl himself  the wrath of the lord turn from him  that he would not destroy him altogeth  and also in judah thing went well  12  13 so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem  and reign  for rehoboam was one and forti year old when he began to reign  and he reign seventeen year in jerusalem  the citi which the lord had chosen out of all the tribe of israel  to put his name there  and his mother  s name was naamah an ammonitess  12  14 and he did evil  becaus he prepar not his heart to seek the lord  12  15 now the act of rehoboam  first and last  are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet  and of iddo the seer concern genealog  and there were war between rehoboam and jeroboam continu  12  16 and rehoboam slept with his father  and was buri in the citi of david  and abijah his son reign in his stead  13  1 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah  13  2 he reign three year in jerusalem  his mother  s name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah  and there was war between abijah and jeroboam  13  3 and abijah set the battl in array with an armi of valiant men of war  even four hundr thousand chosen men  jeroboam also set the battl in array against him with eight hundr thousand chosen men  be mighti men of valour  13  4 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim  which is in mount ephraim  and said  hear me  thou jeroboam  and all israel  13  5 ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever  even to him and to his son by a coven of salt  13  6 yet jeroboam the son of nebat  the servant of solomon the son of david  is risen up  and hath rebel against his lord  13  7 and there are gather unto him vain men  the children of belial  and have strengthen themselv against rehoboam the son of solomon  when rehoboam was young and tenderheart  and could not withstand them  13  8 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the son of david  and ye be a great multitud  and there are with your golden calv  which jeroboam made you for god  13  9 have ye not cast out the priest of the lord  the son of aaron  and the levit  and have made you priest after the manner of the nation of other land  so that whosoev cometh to consecr himself with a young bullock and seven ram  the same may be a priest of them that are no god  13  10 but as for us  the lord is our god  and we have not forsaken him  and the priest  which minist unto the lord  are the son of aaron  and the levit wait upon their busi  13  11 and they burn unto the lord everi morn and everi even burnt sacrific and sweet incens  the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure tabl  and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof  to burn everi even  for we keep the charg of the lord our god  but ye have forsaken him  13  12 and  behold  god himself is with us for our captain  and his priest with sound trumpet to cri alarm against you  o children of israel  fight ye not against the lord god of your father  for ye shall not prosper  13  13 but jeroboam caus an ambush to come about behind them  so they were befor judah  and the ambush was behind them  13  14 and when judah look back  behold  the battl was befor and behind  and they cri unto the lord  and the priest sound with the trumpet  13  15 then the men of judah gave a shout  and as the men of judah shout  it came to pass  that god smote jeroboam and all israel befor abijah and judah  13  16 and the children of israel fled befor judah  and god deliv them into their hand  13  17 and abijah and his peopl slew them with a great slaughter  so there fell down slain of israel five hundr thousand chosen men  13  18 thus the children of israel were brought under at that time  and the children of judah prevail  becaus they reli upon the lord god of their father  13  19 and abijah pursu after jeroboam  and took citi from him  bethel with the town thereof  and jeshanah with the town thereof  and ephraim with the town thereof  13  20 neither did jeroboam recov strength again in the day of abijah  and the lord struck him  and he die  13  21 but abijah wax mighti  and marri fourteen wive  and begat twenti and two son  and sixteen daughter  13  22 and the rest of the act of abijah  and his way  and his say  are written in the stori of the prophet iddo  14  1 so abijah slept with his father  and they buri him in the citi of david  and asa his son reign in his stead  in his day the land was quiet ten year  14  2 and asa did that which was good and right in the eye of the lord his god  14  3 for he took away the altar of the strang god  and the high place  and brake down the imag  and cut down the grove  14  4 and command judah to seek the lord god of their father  and to do the law and the command  14  5 also he took away out of all the citi of judah the high place and the imag  and the kingdom was quiet befor him  14  6 and he built fenc citi in judah  for the land had rest  and he had no war in those year  becaus the lord had given him rest  14  7 therefor he said unto judah  let us build these citi  and make about them wall  and tower  gate  and bar  while the land is yet befor us  becaus we have sought the lord our god  we have sought him  and he hath given us rest on everi side  so they built and prosper  14  8 and asa had an armi of men that bare target and spear  out of judah three hundr thousand  and out of benjamin  that bare shield and drew bow  two hundr and fourscor thousand  all these were mighti men of valour  14  9 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand  and three hundr chariot  and came unto mareshah  14  10 then asa went out against him  and they set the battl in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah  14  11 and asa cri unto the lord his god  and said  lord  it is noth with thee to help  whether with mani  or with them that have no power  help us  o lord our god  for we rest on thee  and in thi name we go against this multitud  o lord  thou art our god  let no man prevail against thee  14  12 so the lord smote the ethiopian befor asa  and befor judah  and the ethiopian fled  14  13 and asa and the peopl that were with him pursu them unto gerar  and the ethiopian were overthrown  that they could not recov themselv  for they were destroy befor the lord  and befor his host  and they carri away veri much spoil  14  14 and they smote all the citi round about gerar  for the fear of the lord came upon them  and they spoil all the citi  for there was exceed much spoil in them  14  15 they smote

said  go up  for god will deliv it into the king  s hand  18  6 but jehoshaphat said  is there not here a prophet of the lord besid  that we might enquir of him  18  7 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  there is yet one man  by whom we may enquir of the lord  but i hate him  for he never prophesi good unto me  but alway evil  the same is micaiah the son of imla  and jehoshaphat said  let not the king say so  18  8 and the king of israel call for one of his offic  and said  fetch quick micaiah the son of imla  18  9 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne  cloth in their robe  and they sat in a void place at the enter in of the gate of samaria  and all the prophet prophesi befor them  18  10 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made

shall deliv it into the hand of the king  18  12 and the messeng that went to call micaiah spake to him  say  behold  the word of the prophet declar good to the king with one assent  let thi word therefor  i pray thee  be like one of their  s  and speak thou good  18  13 and micaiah said  as the lord liveth  even what my god saith  that will i speak  18  14 and when he was come to the king  the king said unto him  micaiah  shall we go to ramothgilead to battl  or shall i forbear  and he said  go ye up  and prosper  and they shall be deliv into your hand  18  15 and the king said to him  how mani time shall i adjur thee that thou say noth but the truth to me in the name of the lord  18  16 then he said  i did see all israel scatter upon the mountain  as sheep that have no shepherd  and the lord said  these have no master  let them return therefor everi man to his hous in peac  18  17 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat  did i not tell thee that he would not prophesi good unto me  but evil  18  18 again he said  therefor hear the word of the lord  i saw the lord sit upon his throne  and all the host of heaven stand on his right hand and on his left  18  19 and the lord said  who shall entic ahab king of israel  that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead  and one spake say after this manner  and anoth say after that manner  18  20 then there came out a spirit  and stood befor the lord  and said  i will entic him  and the lord said unto him  wherewith  18  21 and he said  i will go out  and be a lie spirit in the mouth of all his prophet  and the lord said  thou

against thee  18  23 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near  and smote micaiah upon the cheek  and said  which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee  18  24 and micaiah said  behold  thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself  18  25 then the king of israel said  take ye micaiah  and carri him back to amon the governor of the citi  and to joash the king  s son  18  26 and say  thus saith the king  put this fellow in the prison  and feed him with bread of afflict and with water of afflict  until i return in peac  18  27 and micaiah said  if thou certain return in peac  then hath not the lord spoken by me  and he said  hearken  all ye peopl  18  28 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead  18  29 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat  i will disguis myself  and i will go to the battl  but put thou on thi robe  so the king of israel disguis himself  and they went to the battl  18  30 now the king of syria had command the captain of the chariot that were with him  say  fight ye not with small or great  save onli with the king of israel  18  31 and it came to pass  when the captain of the chariot saw jehoshaphat  that they said  it is the king of israel  therefor they compass about him to fight  but jehoshaphat cri out  and the lord help him  and god move them

bow at a ventur  and smote the king of israel between the joint of the har  therefor he said to his chariot man  turn thine hand  that thou mayest carri me out of the host  for i am wound  18  34 and the battl increas that day  howbeit the king of israel stay himself up in his chariot against the syrian until the even  and about the time of the sun go down he die  19  1 and jehoshaphat the king of judah return to his hous in peac to jerusalem  19  2 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him  and said to king jehoshaphat  shouldest thou help the ungod  and love them that hate the lord  therefor is wrath upon thee from befor the lord  19  3 nevertheless there are good thing found in thee  in that thou hast taken away the grove out of the land  and hast prepar thine heart to seek god  19  4 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem  and he went out again through the peopl from beersheba to mount ephraim  and brought them back unto the lord god of their father  19  5 and he set judg in the land throughout all the fenc citi of judah  citi by citi  19  6 and said to the judg  take heed what ye do  for ye judg not for man  but for the lord  who is with you in the judgment  19  7 wherefor now let the fear of the lord be upon you  take heed and do it  for there is no iniqu with the lord our god  nor respect of person  nor take of gift  19  8 moreov in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levit  and of the priest  and of the chief of the father of israel  for the judgment of the lord  and for controversi  when they return to jerusalem  19  9 and he charg them  say  thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord  faith  and with a perfect heart  19  10 and what caus soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your citi  between blood and blood  between

befor you  deal courag  and the lord shall be with the good  20  1 it came to pass after this also  that the children of moab  and the children of ammon  and with them other besid the ammonit  came against jehoshaphat to battl  20  2 then there came some that told jehoshaphat  say  there cometh a great multitud against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria  and  behold  they be in hazazontamar  which is engedi  20  3 and jehoshaphat fear  and set himself to seek the lord  and proclaim a fast throughout all judah  20  4 and judah gather themselv togeth  to ask help of the lord  even out of all the citi of judah they came to seek the lord  20  5 and jehoshaphat stood in the congreg of judah and jerusalem  in the hous of the lord  befor the new court  20  6 and said  o lord god of our father  art not thou god in heaven  and rulest not thou over all the kingdom of the heathen  and in thine hand is there not power and might  so that none is abl to withstand thee  20  7 art

sanctuari therein for thi name  say  20  9 if  when evil cometh upon us  as the sword  judgment  or pestil  or famin  we stand befor this hous  and in thi presenc   for thi name is in this hous  and cri unto thee in our afflict  then thou wilt hear and help  20  10 and now  behold  the children of ammon and moab and mount seir  whom thou wouldest not let israel invad  when they came out of the land of egypt  but they turn from them  and destroy them not  20  11 behold  i say  how they reward us  to come to cast us out of thi possess  which thou hast given us to inherit  20  12 o our god  wilt thou not judg them  for we have no might against this great compani that cometh against us  neither know we what to do  but our eye are upon thee  20  13 and all judah stood befor the lord  with their littl one  their wive  and their children  20  14 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah  the son of benaiah  the son of jeiel  the son of mattaniah  a levit of the son of asaph  came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congreg  20  15 and he said  hearken ye  all judah  and ye inhabit of jerusalem  and thou king jehoshaphat  thus saith the lord unto you  be not afraid nor dismay by reason of this great multitud  for the battl is not your  but god  s  20  16 to morrow go ye down against them  behold  they come up by the cliff of ziz  and ye shall find them at the end of the brook  befor the wilder of jeruel  20  17 ye shall not need to fight in this battl  set yourselv  stand ye still  and see the salvat of the lord with you  o judah and jerusalem  fear not  nor be dismay  to morrow go out against them  for the lord will be with you  20  18 and jehoshaphat bow his head with his face to the ground  and all judah and the inhabit of jerusalem fell befor the lord  worship the lord  20  19 and the levit  of the children of the kohathit  and of the children of the korhit  stood up to prais the lord god of israel with a loud voic on high  20  20 and they rose earli in the morn  and went forth into the wilder of tekoa  and as they went forth  jehoshaphat stood and said  hear me  o judah  and ye inhabit of jerusalem  believ in the lord your god  so shall ye be establish  believ his prophet  so shall ye prosper  20  21 and when he had consult with the peopl  he appoint singer unto the lord  and that should prais the beauti of holi  as they went out befor the armi  and to say  prais the lord  for his merci endureth for ever  20  22 and when they began to sing and to prais  the lord set ambush against the children of ammon  moab  and mount seir  which were come against judah  and they were smitten  20  23 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabit of mount seir  utter to slay and destroy them  and when they had made an end of the inhabit of seir  everi one help to destroy anoth  20  24 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilder  they look unto the multitud  and  behold  they were dead bodi fallen to the earth  and none escap  20  25 and when jehoshaphat and his peopl came to take away the spoil of them  they found among them in abund both rich with the dead bodi  and precious jewel  which they strip off for themselv  more than they could carri away  and they were three day in gather of the spoil  it was so much  20  26 and on the fourth day they assembl themselv in the valley of berachah  for there they bless the lord  therefor the name of the same place was call  the valley of berachah  unto this day  20  27 then they return  everi man of judah and jerusalem  and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them  to go again to jerusalem with joy  for the lord had made them to rejoic over their enemi  20  28 and they came to jerusalem with psalteri and harp and trumpet unto the hous of the lord  20  29 and the fear of god was on all the kingdom of those countri  when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemi of israel  20  30 so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet  for his god gave him rest round about  20  31 and jehoshaphat reign over judah  he was thirti and five year old when he began to reign  and he reign twenti and five year in jerusalem  and his mother  s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi  20  32 and he walk in the way of asa his father  and depart not from it  do that which was right in the sight of the lord  20  33 howbeit the high place were not taken away  for as yet the peopl had not prepar their heart unto the god of their father  20  34 now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat  first and last  behold  they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani  who is mention in the book of the king of israel  20  35 and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel  who did veri wick  20  36 and he join himself with him to make ship to go to tarshish  and they made the ship in eziongab  20  37 then eliez the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesi against jehoshaphat  say  becaus thou hast join thyself with ahaziah  the lord hath broken thi work  and the ship were broken  that they were not abl to go to tarshish  21  1 now jehoshaphat slept with his father  and was buri with his father in the citi of david  and jehoram his son reign in his stead  21  2 and he had brethren the son of jehoshaphat  azariah  and jehiel  and zechariah  and azariah  and michael  and shephatiah  all these were the son of jehoshaphat king of israel  21  3 and their father gave them great gift of silver  and of gold  and of precious thing  with fenc citi in judah  but the kingdom gave he to jehoram  becaus he was the firstborn  21  4 now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father  he strengthen himself  and slew all his brethren with the sword  and diver also of the princ of israel  21  5 jehoram was thirti and two year old when he began to reign  and he reign eight year in jerusalem  21  6 and he walk in the way of the king of israel  like as did the hous of ahab  for he had the daughter of ahab to wife  and he wrought that which was evil in the eye of the lord  21  7 howbeit the lord would not destroy the hous of david  becaus of the coven that he had made with david  and as he promis to give a light to him and to his son for ever  21  8 in his day the edomit revolt from under the dominion of judah  and made themselv a king  21  9 then jehoram went forth with his princ  and all his chariot with him  and he rose up by night  and smote the edomit which compass him in  and the captain of the chariot  21  10 so the edomit revolt from under the hand of judah unto this day  the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand  becaus he had forsaken the lord god of his father  21  11 moreov he made high place in the mountain of judah and caus the inhabit of jerusalem to commit fornic  and compel judah thereto  21  12 and there came a write to him from elijah the prophet  say  thus saith the lord god of david thi father  becaus thou hast not walk in the way of jehoshaphat thi father  nor in the way of asa king of judah  21  13 but hast walk in the way of the king of israel  and hast made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to go a whore  like to the whoredom of the hous of ahab  and also hast slain thi brethren of thi father  s hous  which were better than thyself  21  14 behold  with a great plagu will the lord smite thi peopl  and thi children  and thi wive  and all thi good  21  15 and thou shalt have great sick by diseas of thi bowel  until thi bowel fall out by reason of the sick day by day  21  16 moreov the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the philistin  and of the arabian  that were near the ethiopian  21  17 and they came up into judah  and brake into it  and carri away all the substanc that was found in the king  s hous  and his son also  and his wive  so that there was never a son left him  save jehoahaz  the youngest of his son  21  18 and after all this the lord smote him in his bowel with an incur diseas  21  19 and it came to pass  that in process of time  after the end of two year  his bowel fell out by reason of his sick  so he die of sore diseas  and his peopl made no burn for him  like the burn of his father  21  20 thirti and two year old was he when he began to reign  and he reign in jerusalem eight year  and depart without be desir  howbeit they buri him in the citi of david  but not in the sepulchr of the king  22  1 and the inhabit of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead  for the band of men that came with the arabian to the camp had slain all the eldest  so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reign  22  2 forti and two year old was ahaziah when he began to reign  and he reign one year in jerusalem  his mother  s name also was athaliah the daughter of omri  22  3 he also walk in the way of the hous of ahab  for his mother was his counsellor to do wick  22  4 wherefor he did evil in the sight of the lord like the hous of ahab  for they were his counsellor after the death of his father to his destruct  22  5 he walk also after their counsel  and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead  and the syrian smote joram  22  6 and he return to be heal in jezreel becaus of the wound which were given him at ramah  when he fought with hazael king of syria  and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel  becaus he was sick  22  7 and the destruct of ahaziah was of god by come to joram  for when he was come  he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi  whom the lord had anoint to cut off the hous of ahab  22  8 and it came to pass  that  when jehu was execut judgment upon the hous of ahab  and found the princ of judah  and the son of the brethren of ahaziah  that minist to ahaziah  he slew them  22  9 and he sought ahaziah  and they caught him   for he was hid in samaria  and brought him to jehu  and when they had slain him  they buri him  becaus  said they  he is the son of jehoshaphat  who sought the lord with all his heart  so the hous of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom  22  10 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead  she aros and destroy all the seed royal of the hous of judah  22  11 but jehoshabeath  the daughter of the king  took joash the son of ahaziah  and stole him from among the king  s son that were slain  and put him and his nurs in a bedchamb  so jehoshabeath  the daughter of king jehoram  the wife of jehoiada the priest   for she was the sister of ahaziah  hid him from athaliah  so that she slew him not  22  12 and he was with them hid in the hous of god six year  and athaliah reign over the land  23  1 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself  and took the captain of hundr  azariah the son of jeroham  and ishmael the son of jehohanan  and azariah the son of obe  and maaseiah the son of adaiah  and elishaphat the

hous  he shall be put to death  but be ye with the king when he cometh in  and when he goeth out  23  8 so the levit and all judah did accord to all thing that jehoiada the priest had command  and took everi man his men that were to come in on the sabbath  with them that were to go out on the sabbath  for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the cours  23  9 moreov jehoiada the priest deliv to the

of the templ to the left side of the templ  along by the altar and the templ  by the king round about  23  11 then they brought out the king  s son  and put upon him the crown  and gave him the testimoni  and made him king  and jehoiada and his son anoint him  and said  god save the king  23  12 now when athaliah heard the nois of the peopl run and prais the king  she came to the peopl into

lord  23  15 so they laid hand on her  and when she was come to the enter of the hors gate by the king  s hous  they slew her there  23  16 and jehoiada made a coven between him  and between all the peopl  and between the king  that they should be the lord  s peopl  23  17 then all the peopl went to the hous of baal  and brake it down  and brake his altar and his imag in piec  and slew mattan the priest of baal befor the altar  23  18 also jehoiada appoint the offic of the hous of the lord by the hand of the priest the levit  whom david had distribut in the hous of the lord  to offer the burnt offer of the lord  as it is written in the law of mose  with rejoic and with sing  as it was ordain by david  23  19 and he set the porter at the gate of the hous of the lord  that none which was unclean in ani thing should enter in  23  20 and he took the captain of hundr  and the nobl  and the governor of the peopl  and all the peopl of the land  and brought down the king from the hous of the lord  and they came through the high gate into the king  s hous  and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom  23  21 and all the peopl of the land rejoic  and the citi was quiet  after that they had slain athaliah with the sword  24  1 joash was seven year old when he began to reign  and he reign forti year in jerusalem  his mother  s name also was zibiah of beersheba  24  2 and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the day of jehoiada the priest  24  3 and jehoiada took for him two wive  and he begat son and daughter  24  4 and it came to pass after this  that joash was mind to repair the hous of the lord  24  5 and he gather togeth the priest and the levit  and said to them  go out unto the citi of judah  and gather of all israel money to repair the hous of your god from year to year  and see that ye hasten the matter  howbeit the levit hasten it not  24  6 and the king call for jehoiada the chief  and said unto him  whi hast thou not requir of the levit to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collect  accord to the command of mose the servant of the lord  and of the congreg of israel  for the tabernacl of wit  24  7 for the son of athaliah  that wick woman  had broken up the hous of god  and also all the dedic thing of the hous of the lord did they bestow upon baalim  24  8 and at the king  s command they made a chest  and set it without at the gate of the hous of the lord  24  9 and they made a proclam through judah and jerusalem  to bring in to the lord the collect that mose the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilder  24  10 and all the princ and all the peopl rejoic  and brought in  and cast into the chest  until they had made an end  24  11 now it came to pass  that at what time the chest was brought unto the king  s offic by the hand of the levit  and when they saw that there was much money  the king  s scribe and the high priest  s offic came and empti the chest  and took it  and carri it to his place again  thus they did day by day  and gather money in abund  24  12 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the servic of the hous of the lord  and hire mason and carpent to repair the hous of the lord  and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the hous of the lord  24  13 so the workmen wrought  and the work was perfect by them  and they set the hous of god in his state  and strengthen it  24  14 and when they had finish it  they brought the rest of the money befor the king and jehoiada  whereof were made vessel for the hous of the lord  even vessel to minist  and to offer withal  and spoon  and vessel of gold and silver  and they offer burnt offer in the hous of the lord continu all the day of jehoiada  24  15 but jehoiada wax old  and was full of day when he die  an hundr and thirti year old was he when he die  24  16 and they buri him in the citi of david among the king  becaus he had done good in israel  both toward god  and toward his hous  24  17 now after the death of jehoiada came the princ of judah  and made obeis to the king  then the king hearken unto them  24  18 and they left the hous of the lord god of their father  and serv grove and idol  and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass  24  19 yet he sent prophet to them  to bring them again unto the lord  and they testifi against them  but they would not give ear  24  20 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest  which stood abov the peopl  and said unto them  thus saith god  whi transgress ye the command of the lord  that ye cannot prosper  becaus ye have forsaken the lord  he hath also forsaken you  24  21 and they conspir against him  and stone him with stone at the command of the king in the court of the hous of the lord  24  22 thus joash the king rememb not the kind which jehoiada his father had done to him  but slew his son  and when he die  he said  the lord look upon it  and requir it  24  23 and it came to pass at the end of the year  that the host of syria came up against him  and they came to judah and jerusalem  and destroy all the princ of the peopl from among the peopl  and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus  24  24 for the armi of the syrian came with a small compani of men  and the lord deliv a veri great host into their hand  becaus they had forsaken the lord god of their father  so they execut judgment against joash  24  25 and when they were depart from him   for they left him in great diseas  his own servant conspir against him for the blood of the son of jehoiada the priest  and slew him on his bed  and he die  and they buri him in the citi of david  but they buri him not in the sepulchr of the king  24  26 and these are they that conspir against him  zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess  and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess  24  27 now concern his son  and the great of the burden laid upon him  and the repair of the hous of god  behold  they are written in the stori of the book of the king  and amaziah his son reign in his stead  25  1 amaziah was twenti and five year old when he began to reign  and he reign twenti and nine year in jerusalem  and his mother  s name was jehoaddan of jerusalem  25  2 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord  but not with a perfect heart  25  3 now it came to pass  when the kingdom was establish to him  that he slew his servant that had kill the king his father  25  4 but he slew not their children  but did as it is written in the law in the book of mose  where the lord command  say  the father shall not die for the children  neither shall the children die for the father  but everi man shall die for his own sin  25  5 moreov amaziah gather judah togeth  and made them captain over thousand  and captain over hundr  accord to the hous of their father  throughout all judah and benjamin  and he number them from twenti year old and abov  and found them three hundr thousand choic men  abl to go forth to war  that could handl spear and shield  25  6 he hire also an hundr thousand mighti men of valour out of israel for an hundr talent of silver  25  7 but there came a man of god to him  say  o king  let not the armi of israel go with thee  for the lord is not with israel  to wit  with all the children of ephraim  25  8 but if thou wilt go  do it  be strong for the battl  god shall make thee fall befor the enemi  for god hath power to help  and to cast down  25  9 and amaziah said to the man of god  but what shall we do for the hundr talent which i have given to the armi of israel  and the man of god answer  the lord is abl to give thee much more than this  25  10 then amaziah separ them  to wit  the armi that was come to him out of ephraim  to go home again  wherefor their anger was great kindl against judah  and they return home in great anger  25  11 and amaziah strengthen himself  and led forth his peopl  and went to the valley of salt  and smote of the children of seir ten thousand  25  12 and other ten thousand left aliv did the children of judah carri away captiv  and brought them unto the top of the rock  and cast them down from the top of the rock  that they all were broken in piec  25  13 but the soldier of the armi which amaziah sent back  that they should not go with him to battl  fell upon the citi of judah  from samaria even unto bethhoron  and smote three thousand of them  and took much spoil  25  14 now it came to pass  after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomit  that he brought the god of the children of seir  and set them up to be his god  and bow down himself befor them  and burn incens unto them  25  15 wherefor the anger of the lord was kindl against amaziah  and he sent unto him a prophet  which said unto him  whi hast thou sought after the god of the peopl  which could not deliv their own peopl out of thine hand  25  16 and it came to pass  as he talk with him  that the king said unto him  art thou made of the king  s counsel  forbear  whi shouldest thou be smitten  then the prophet forbar  and said  i know that god hath determin to destroy thee  becaus thou hast done this  and hast not hearken unto my counsel  25  17 then amaziah king of judah took advic  and sent to joash  the son of jehoahaz  the son of jehu  king of israel  say  come  let us see one anoth in the face  25  18 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah  say  the thistl that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon  say  give thi daughter to my son to wife  and there pass by a wild beast that was in lebanon  and trode down the thistl  25  19 thou sayest  lo  thou hast smitten the edomit  and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast  abid now at home  whi shouldest thou meddl to thine hurt  that thou shouldest fall  even thou  and judah with thee  25  20 but amaziah would not hear  for it came of god  that he might deliv them into the hand of their enemi  becaus they sought after the god of edom  25  21 so joash the king of israel went up  and they saw one anoth in the face  both he and amaziah king of judah  at bethshemesh  which belongeth to judah  25  22 and judah was put to the wors befor israel  and they fled everi man to his tent  25  23 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah  the son of joash  the son of jehoahaz  at bethshemesh  and brought him to jerusalem  and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate  four hundr cubit  25  24 and he took all the gold and the silver  and all the vessel that were found in the

king of israel fifteen year  25  26 now the rest of the act of amaziah  first and last  behold  are they not written in the book of the king of judah and israel  25  27 now after the time that amaziah did turn away from follow the lord they made a conspiraci against him in jerusalem  and he fled to lachish  but they sent to lachish after him  and slew him there  25  28 and they brought him upon hors  and buri him with his father in the citi of judah  26  1 then all the peopl of judah took uzziah  who was sixteen year old  and made him king in the room of his father amaziah  26  2 he built

were two thousand and six hundr  26  13 and under their hand was an armi  three hundr thousand and seven thousand and five hundr  that made war with mighti power  to help the king against the enemi  26  14 and uzziah prepar for them throughout all the host shield  and spear  and helmet  and habergeon  and bow  and sling to cast stone  26  15 and he made in jerusalem engin  invent by cun men  to

the priest the son of aaron  that are consecr to burn incens  go out of the sanctuari  for thou hast trespass  neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god  26  19 then uzziah was wroth  and had a censer in his hand to burn incens  and while he was wroth with the priest  the leprosi even rose up in his forehead befor the priest in the hous of the lord  from besid the incens altar  26  20 and azariah the chief priest  and all the priest  look upon him  and  behold  he was leprous in his forehead  and they thrust him out from thenc  yea  himself hast also to go out  becaus the lord had

after the abomin of the heathen whom the lord had cast out befor the children of israel  28  4 he sacrif also and burnt incens in the high place  and on the hill  and under everi green tree  28  5 wherefor the lord his god deliv him into the hand of the king of syria  and they smote him  and carri away a great multitud of them captiv  and brought them to damascus  and he was also deliv into the hand of the king of israel  who smote him with a great slaughter  28  6 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundr and twenti thousand in one day  which were all valiant men  becaus they had forsaken the lord god of their father  28  7 and zichri  a mighti man of ephraim  slew maaseiah the king  s son  and azrikam the governor of the hous  and elkanah that was next to the king  28  8 and the children of israel carri away captiv of their brethren two hundr thousand  women  son  and daughter  and took also away much spoil from them  and brought the spoil to samaria  28  9 but a prophet of the lord was there  whose name was ode  and he went out befor the host that came to samaria  and said unto them  behold  becaus the lord god of your father was wroth with judah  he hath deliv them into your hand  and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven  28  10 and now ye purpos to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you  but are there not with you  even with you  sin against the lord your god  28  11 now hear me therefor  and deliv the captiv again  which ye have taken captiv of your brethren  for the fierc wrath of the lord is upon you  28  12 then certain of the head of the children of ephraim  azariah the son of johanan  berechiah the son of meshillemoth  and jehizkiah the son of shallum  and amasa the son of hadlai  stood up against them that came from the war  28  13 and said unto them  ye shall not bring in the captiv hither  for wherea we have offend against the lord alreadi  ye intend to add more to our sin and to our trespass  for our trespass is great  and there is fierc wrath against israel  28  14 so the arm men left the captiv and the spoil befor the princ and all the congreg  28  15 and the men which were express by name rose up  and took the captiv  and with the spoil cloth all that were nake among them  and array them  and shod them  and gave them to eat and to drink  and anoint them  and carri all the feebl of them upon ass  and brought them to jericho  the citi of palm tree  to their brethren  then they return to samaria  28  16 at that time did king ahaz send unto the king of

taken bethshemesh  and ajalon  and gederoth  and shocho with the villag thereof  and timnah with the villag thereof  gimzo also and the villag thereof  and they dwelt there  28  19 for the lord brought judah low becaus of ahaz king of israel  for he made judah nake  and transgress sore against the lord  28  20 and tilgathpilnes king of assyria came unto him  and distress him  but strengthen him not  28  21 for ahaz took away a portion out of the hous of the lord  and out of the hous of the king  and of the princ  and gave it unto the king of assyria  but he help him not  28  22 and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord  this is that king ahaz  28  23 for he sacrif unto the god of damascus  which smote him  and he said  becaus the god of the king of syria help them  therefor will i sacrific to them  that they may help me  but they were the ruin of him  and of all israel  28  24 and ahaz gather togeth the vessel of the hous of god  and cut in piec the vessel of the hous of god  and shut up the door of the hous of the lord  and he made him altar in everi corner of jerusalem  28  25 and in everi sever citi of judah he made high place to burn incens unto other god  and provok to anger the lord god of his father  28  26 now the rest of his act and of all his way  first and last  behold  they are written in the book of the king of judah and israel  28  27 and ahaz slept with his father  and they buri him in the citi  even in jerusalem  but they brought him not into the sepulchr of the king of israel  and hezekiah his son reign in his stead  29  1 hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenti year old  and he reign nine and twenti year in jerusalem  and his mother  s name was abijah  the daughter of zechariah  29  2 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord  accord to all that david his father had done  29  3 he in the first year of his reign  in the first month  open the door of the hous of the lord  and repair them  29  4 and he brought in the priest and the levit  and gather them togeth into the east street  29  5 and said unto them  hear me  ye levit  sanctifi now yourselv  and sanctifi the hous of the lord god of your father  and carri forth the filthi out of the holi place  29  6 for our father have trespass  and done that which was evil in the eye of the lord our god  and have forsaken him  and have turn away their face from the habit of the lord  and turn their back  29  7 also they have shut up the door of the porch  and put out the lamp  and have not burn incens nor offer burnt offer in the holi place unto the god of israel  29  8 wherefor the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem  and he hath deliv them to troubl  to astonish  and to hiss  as ye see with your eye  29  9 for  lo  our father have fallen by the sword  and our son and our daughter and our wive are in captiv for this  29  10 now it is in mine heart to make a coven with the lord god of israel  that his fierc wrath may turn away from us  29  11 my son  be not now neglig  for the lord hath chosen you to stand befor him  to serv him  and that ye should minist unto him  and burn incens  29  12 then the levit aros  mahath the son of amasai  and joel the son of azariah  of the son of the kohathit  and of the son of merari  kish the son of abdi  and azariah the son of jehalelel  and of the gershonit  joah the son of zimmah  and eden the son of joah  29  13 and of the son of elizaphan  shimri  and jeiel  and of the son of asaph  zechariah  and mattaniah  29  14 and of the son of heman  jehiel  and shimei  and of the son of jeduthun  shemaiah  and uzziel  29  15 and they gather their brethren  and sanctifi themselv  and came  accord to the command of the king  by the word of the lord  to cleans

that the burnt offer and the sin offer should be made for all israel  29  25 and he set the levit in the hous of the lord with cymbal  with psalteri  and with harp  accord to the command of david  and of gad the king  s seer  and nathan the prophet  for so was the command of the lord by his prophet  29  26 and the levit stood with the instrument of david  and the priest with the trumpet  29  27 and hezekiah command to offer the burnt offer upon the altar  and when the burnt offer began  the song of the lord began also with the trumpet  and with the instrument ordain by david king of israel  29  28 and all the congreg worship  and the singer sang  and the trumpet sound  and all this continu until the burnt offer was finish  29  29 and when they had made an end of offer  the king and all that

too few  so that they could not flay all the burnt offer  wherefor their brethren the levit did help them  till the work was end  and until the other priest had sanctifi themselv  for the levit were more upright in heart to sanctifi themselv than the priest  29  35 and also the burnt offer were in abund  with the fat of the peac offer  and the drink offer for everi burnt offer  so the servic of the hous of the lord was set in order  29  36 and hezekiah rejoic  and all the peopl  that god had prepar the peopl  for the thing was done sudden  30  1 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah  and wrote letter also to ephraim and manasseh  that they should come to the hous of the lord at jerusalem  to keep the passov unto the lord god of israel  30  2 for the king had taken counsel  and his princ  and all the congreg in jerusalem  to keep the passov in the second month  30  3 for they could not keep it at that time  becaus the priest had not sanctifi themselv suffici  neither had the peopl gather themselv togeth to jerusalem  30  4 and the thing pleas the king and all the congreg  30  5 so they establish a decre to make proclam throughout all israel  from beersheba even to dan  that they should come to keep the passov unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem  for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written  30  6 so the post went with the letter from the king and his princ throughout all israel and judah  and accord to the command of the king  say  ye children of israel  turn again unto the lord god of abraham  isaac  and israel  and he will return to the remnant of you  that are escap out of the hand of the king of assyria  30  7 and be not ye like your father  and like your brethren  which trespass against the lord god of their father

 18 for a multitud of the peopl  even mani of ephraim  and manasseh  issachar  and zebulun  had not cleans themselv  yet did they eat the passov otherwis than it was written  but hezekiah pray for

hezekiah king of judah did give to the congreg a thousand bullock and seven thousand sheep  and the princ gave to the congreg a thousand bullock and ten thousand sheep  and a great number of priest

and in everi work that he began in the servic of the hous of god  and in the law  and in the command  to seek his god  he did it with all his heart  and prosper  32  1 after these thing  and the establish thereof  sennacherib king of assyria came  and enter into judah  and encamp against the fenc citi  and thought to win them for himself  32  2 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come  and that he was purpos to fight against jerusalem  32  3 he took counsel with his princ and his mighti men to stop the water of the fountain which were without the citi  and they did help him  32  4 so there was gather much peopl togeth  who stop all the fountain  and the brook that ran through the midst of the land  say  whi should the king of assyria come  and find much water  32  5 also he strengthen himself  and built up all the wall that was broken  and rais it up to the tower  and anoth wall without  and repair millo in the citi of david  and made dart and shield in abund  32  6 and he set captain of war over the peopl  and gather them togeth to him in the street of the gate of the citi  and spake comfort to them  say  32  7 be strong and courag  be not afraid nor dismay for the king of assyria  nor for all the multitud that is with him  for there be more with us than with him  32  8 with him is an arm of flesh  but with us is the lord our god to help us  and to fight our battl  and the peopl rest themselv upon the word of hezekiah king of judah  32  9 after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servant to jerusalem   but he himself laid sieg against lachish  and all his power with him  unto hezekiah king of judah  and unto all judah that were at jerusalem  say  32  10 thus saith sennacherib king of assyria  whereon do ye trust  that ye abid in the sieg in jerusalem  32  11 doth not hezekiah persuad you to give over yourselv to die by famin and by thirst  say  the lord our god shall deliv us out of the hand of the king of assyria  32  12 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high place and his altar  and command judah and jerusalem  say  ye shall worship befor one altar  and burn incens upon it  32  13 know ye not what i and my father have done unto all the peopl of other land  were the god of the nation of those land ani way abl to deliv their land out of mine hand  32  14 who was there among all the god of those nation that my father utter destroy  that could deliv his peopl out of mine hand  that your god should be abl to deliv you out of mine hand  32  15 now therefor let not hezekiah deceiv you  nor persuad you on this manner  neither yet believ him  for no god of ani nation or kingdom was abl to deliv his peopl out of mine hand  and out of the hand of my father  how much less shall your god deliv you out of mine hand  32  16 and his servant spake yet more against the lord god  and against his servant hezekiah  32  17 he wrote also letter to rail on the lord god of israel  and to speak against him  say  as the god of the nation of other land have not deliv their peopl out of mine hand  so shall not the god of hezekiah deliv his peopl out of mine hand  32  18 then they cri with a loud voic in the jew  speech unto the peopl of jerusalem that were on the wall  to affright them  and to troubl them  that they might take the citi  32  19 and they spake against the god of jerusalem  as against the god of the peopl of the earth  which were the work of the hand of man  32  20 and for this caus hezekiah the king  and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz  pray and cri to heaven  32  21 and the lord sent an angel  which cut off all the mighti men of valour  and the leader and captain in the camp of the king of assyria  so he return with shame of face to his own land  and when he was come into the hous of his god  they that came forth of his own bowel slew him there with the sword  32  22 thus the lord save hezekiah and the inhabit of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria  and from the hand of all other  and guid them on everi side  32  23 and mani brought gift unto the lord to jerusalem  and present to hezekiah king of judah  so that he was magnifi in the sight of all nation from thenceforth  32  24 in those day hezekiah was sick to the death  and pray unto the lord  and he spake unto him  and he gave him a sign  32  25 but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit done unto him  for his heart was lift up  therefor there was wrath upon him  and upon judah and jerusalem  32  26 notwithstand hezekiah humbl himself for the pride of his heart  both he and the inhabit of jerusalem  so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the day of hezekiah  32  27 and hezekiah had exceed much rich and honour  and he made himself treasuri for silver  and for gold  and for precious stone  and for spice  and for shield  and for all manner of pleasant jewel  32  28 storehous also for the increas of corn  and wine  and oil  and stall for all manner of beast  and cote for flock  32  29 moreov he provid him citi  and possess of flock and herd in abund  for god had given him substanc veri much  32  30 this same hezekiah also stop the upper watercours of gihon  and brought it straight down to the west side of the citi of david  and hezekiah prosper in all his work  32  31 howbeit in the busi of the ambassador of the princ of babylon  who sent unto him to enquir of the wonder that was done in the land  god left him  to tri him  that he might know all that was in his heart  32  32 now the rest of the act of hezekiah  and his good  behold  they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet  the son of amoz  and in the book of the king of judah and israel  32  33 and hezekiah slept with his father  and they buri him in the chiefest of the sepulchr of the son of david  and all judah and the inhabit of jerusalem did him honour at his death  and manasseh his son reign in his stead  33  1 manasseh was twelv year old when he began to reign  and he reign fifti and five year in jerusalem  33  2 but did that which was evil in the sight of the lord  like unto the abomin of the heathen  whom the lord had cast out befor the children of israel  33  3 for he built again the high place which hezekiah his father had broken down  and he rear up altar for baalim  and made grove  and worship all the host of heaven  and serv them  33  4 also he built altar in the hous of the lord  whereof the lord had said  in jerusalem shall my name be for ever  33  5 and he built altar for all the host of heaven in the two court of the hous of the lord  33  6 and he caus his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom  also he observ time  and use enchant  and use witchcraft  and dealt with a familiar spirit  and with wizard  he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord  to provok him to anger  33  7 and he set a carv imag  the idol which he had made  in the hous of god  of which god had said to david and to solomon his son  in this hous  and in jerusalem  which i have chosen befor all the tribe of israel  will i put my name for ever  33  8 neither will i ani more remov the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appoint for your father  so that they will take heed to do all that i have command them  accord to the whole law and the statut and the ordin by the hand of mose  33  9 so manasseh made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to err  and to do wors than the heathen  whom the lord had destroy befor the children of israel  33  10 and the lord spake to manasseh  and to his peopl  but they would not hearken  33  11 wherefor the lord brought upon them the captain of the host of the king of assyria  which took manasseh among the thorn  and bound him with fetter  and carri him to babylon  33  12 and when he was in afflict  he besought the lord his god  and humbl himself great befor the god of his father  33  13 and pray unto him  and he was intreat of him  and heard his supplic  and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom  then manasseh knew that the lord he was god  33  14 now after this he built a wall without the citi of david  on the west side of gihon  in the valley  even to the enter in at the fish gate  and compass about ophel  and rais it up a veri great height  and put captain of war in all the fenc citi of judah  33  15 and he took away the strang god  and the idol out of the hous of the lord  and all the altar that he had built in the mount of the hous of the lord  and in jerusalem  and cast them out of the citi  33  16 and he repair the altar of the lord  and sacrif thereon peac offer and thank offer  and command judah to serv the lord god of israel  33  17 nevertheless the peopl did sacrific still in the high place  yet unto the lord their god onli  33  18 now the rest of the act of manasseh  and his prayer unto his god  and the word of the seer that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel  behold  they are written in the book of the king of israel  33  19 his prayer also  and how god was intreat of him  and all his sin  and his trespass  and the place wherein he built high place  and set up grove and graven imag  befor he was humbl  behold  they are written among the say of the seer  33  20 so manasseh slept with his father  and they buri him in his own hous  and amon his son reign in his stead  33  21 amon was two and twenti year old when he began to reign  and reign two year in jerusalem  33  22 but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord  as did manasseh his father  for amon sacrif unto all the carv imag which manasseh his father had made  and serv them  33  23 and humbl not himself befor the lord  as manasseh his father had humbl himself  but amon trespass more and more  33  24 and his servant conspir against him  and slew him in his own hous  33  25 but the peopl of the land slew all them that had conspir against king amon  and the peopl of the land made josiah his son king in his stead  34  1 josiah was eight year old when he began to reign  and he reign in jerusalem one and thirti year  34  2 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord  and walk in the way of david his father  and declin neither to the right hand  nor to the left  34  3 for in the eighth year of his reign  while he was yet young  he began to seek after the god of david his father  and in the twelfth year he began to purg judah and jerusalem from the high place  and the grove  and the carv imag  and the molten imag  34  4 and they brake down the altar of baalim in his presenc  and the imag  that were on high abov them  he cut down  and the grove  and the carv imag  and the molten imag  he brake in piec  and made dust of them  and strow it upon the grave of them that had sacrif unto them  34  5 and he burnt the bone of the priest upon their altar  and cleans judah and jerusalem  34  6 and so did he in the citi of manasseh  and ephraim  and simeon  even unto naphtali  with their mattock round about  34  7 and when he had broken down the altar and the grove  and had beaten the graven imag into powder  and cut down all the idol throughout all the land of israel  he return to jerusalem  34  8 now in the eighteenth year of his reign  when he had purg the land  and the hous  he sent shaphan the son of azaliah  and maaseiah the governor of the citi  and joah the son of joahaz the record  to repair the hous of the lord his god  34  9 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest  they deliv the money that was brought into the hous of god  which the levit that kept the door had gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim  and of all the remnant of israel  and of all judah and benjamin  and they return to jerusalem  34  10 and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the hous of the lord  and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the hous of the lord  to repair and amend the hous  34  11 even to the artific and builder gave they it  to buy hewn stone  and timber for coupl  and to floor the hous which the king of judah had destroy  34  12 and the men did the work faith  and the overs of them were jahath and obadiah  the levit  of the son of merari  and zechariah and meshullam  of the son of the kohathit  to set it forward  and other of the levit  all that could skill of instrument of musick  34  13 also they were over the bearer of burden  and were overs of all that wrought the work in ani manner of servic  and of the levit there were scribe  and offic  and porter  34  14 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the hous of the lord  hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by mose  34  15 and hilkiah answer and said to shaphan the scribe  i have found the book of the law in the hous of the lord  and hilkiah deliv the book to shaphan  34  16 and shaphan carri the book to the king  and brought the king word back again  say  all that was commit to thi servant  they do it  34  17 and they have gather togeth the money that was found in the hous of the lord  and have deliv it into the hand of the overs  and to the hand of the workmen  34  18 then shaphan the scribe told the king  say  hilkiah the priest hath given me a book  and shaphan read it befor the king  34  19 and it came to pass  when the king had heard the word of the law  that he rent his cloth  34  20 and the king command hilkiah  and ahikam the son of shaphan  and abdon the son of micah  and shaphan the scribe  and asaiah a servant of the king  s  say  34  21 go  enquir of the lord for me  and for them that

after all that is written in this book  34  22 and hilkiah  and they that the king had appoint  went to huldah the prophetess  the wife of shallum the son of tikvath  the son of hasrah  keeper of the wardrob   now she dwelt in jerusalem in the colleg  and they spake to her to that effect  34  23 and she answer them  thus saith the lord god of israel  tell ye the man that sent you to me  34  24 thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring evil upon this place  and upon the inhabit thereof  even all the curs that are written in the book which they have read befor the king of judah  34  25 becaus they have forsaken me  and have burn incens unto other god  that they might provok me to anger with all the work of their hand  therefor my wrath shall be pour out upon this place  and shall not be

word of the book of the coven that was found in the hous of the lord  34  31 and the king stood in his place  and made a coven befor the lord  to walk after the lord  and to keep his command  and his

brethren and the armi of samaria  and said  what do these feebl jew  will they fortifi themselv  will they sacrific  will they make an end in a day  will they reviv the stone out of the heap of the rubbish which are burn  4  3 now tobiah the ammonit was by him  and he said  even that which they build  if a fox go up  he shall even break down their stone wall  4  4 hear  o our god  for we are despis  and turn their reproach upon their own head  and give them for a prey in the land of captiv  4  5 and cover not their iniqu  and let not their sin be blot out from befor thee  for they have provok thee to anger befor the builder  4  6 so built we the wall  and all the wall was join togeth unto the half thereof  for the peopl had a mind to work  4  7 but it came to pass  that when sanballat  and tobiah  and the arabian  and the ammonit  and the ashdodit  heard that the wall of jerusalem were made up  and that the breach began to be stop  then they were veri wroth  4  8 and conspir all of them togeth to come and to fight against jerusalem  and to hinder it  4  9 nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god  and set a watch against them day and night  becaus of them  4  10 and judah said  the strength of the bearer of burden is decay  and there is much rubbish  so that we are not abl to build the wall  4  11 and our adversari said  they shall not know  neither see  till we come in the midst among them  and slay them  and caus the work to ceas  4  12 and it came to pass  that when the jew which dwelt by them came  they said unto us ten time  from all place whenc ye shall return unto us they will be upon you  4  13 therefor set i in the lower place behind the wall  and on the higher place  i even set the peopl after their famili with their sword  their spear  and their bow  4  14 and i look  and rose up  and said unto the nobl  and to the ruler  and to the rest of the peopl  be not ye afraid of them  rememb the lord  which is great and terribl  and fight for your brethren  your son  and your daughter  your wive  and your hous  4  15 and it came to pass  when our enemi heard that it was known unto us  and god had brought their counsel to nought  that we return all of us to the wall  everi one unto his work  4  16 and it came to pass from that time forth  that the half of my servant wrought in the work  and the other half of them held both the spear  the shield  and the bow  and the habergeon  and the ruler were behind all the hous of judah  4  17 they which build on the wall  and they that bare burden  with those that lade  everi one with one of his hand wrought in the work  and with the other hand held a weapon  4  18 for the builder  everi one had his sword gird by his side  and so build  and he that sound the trumpet was by me  4  19 and i said unto the nobl  and to the ruler  and to the rest of the peopl  the work is great and larg  and we are separ upon the wall  one far from anoth  4  20 in what place therefor ye hear the sound of the trumpet  resort ye thither unto us  our god shall fight for us  4  21 so we labour in the work  and half of them held the spear from the rise of the morn till the star appear  4  22 likewis at the same time said i unto the peopl  let everi one with his servant lodg within jerusalem  that in the night they may be a guard to us  and labour on the day  4  23 so neither i  nor my brethren  nor my servant  nor the men of the guard which follow me  none of us put off our cloth  save that everi one put them off for wash  5  1 and there was a great cri of the peopl and of their wive against their brethren the jew  5  2 for there were that said  we  our son  and our daughter  are mani  therefor we take up corn for them  that we may eat  and live  5  3 some also there were that said  we have mortgag our land  vineyard  and hous  that we might buy corn  becaus of the dearth  5  4 there were also that said  we have borrow money for the king  s tribut  and that upon our land and vineyard  5  5 yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren  our children as their children  and  lo  we bring into bondag our son and our daughter to be servant  and some of our daughter are brought unto bondag alreadi  neither is it in our power to redeem them  for other men have our land and vineyard  5  6 and i was veri angri when i heard their cri and these word  5  7 then i consult with myself  and i rebuk the nobl  and the ruler  and said unto them  ye exact usuri  everi one of his brother  and i set a great assembl against them  5  8 and i said unto them  we after our abil have redeem our brethren the jew  which were sold unto the heathen  and will ye even sell your brethren  or shall they be sold unto us  then held they their peac  and found noth to answer  5  9 also i said  it is not good that ye do  ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god becaus of the reproach of the heathen our enemi  5  10 i likewis  and my brethren  and my servant  might exact of them money and corn  i pray you  let us leav off this usuri  5  11 restor  i pray you  to them  even this day  their land  their vineyard  their oliveyard  and their hous  also the hundredth part of the money  and of the corn  the wine  and the oil  that ye exact of them  5  12 then said they  we will restor them  and will requir noth of them  so will we do as thou sayest  then i call the priest  and took an oath of them  that they should do accord to this promis  5  13 also i shook my lap  and said  so god shake out everi man from his hous  and from his labour  that performeth not this promis  even thus be he shaken out  and empti  and all the congreg said  amen  and prais the lord  and the peopl did accord to this promis  5  14 moreov from the time that i was appoint to be their governor in the land of judah  from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerx the king  that is  twelv year  i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor  5  15 but the former governor that had been befor me were chargeabl unto the peopl  and had taken of them bread and wine  besid forti shekel of silver  yea  even their servant bare rule over the peopl  but so did not i  becaus of the fear of god  5  16 yea  also i continu in the work of this wall  neither bought we ani land  and all my servant were gather thither unto the work  5  17 moreov there were at my tabl an hundr and fifti of the jew and ruler  besid those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us  5  18 now that which was prepar for me daili was one ox and six choic sheep  also fowl were prepar for me  and onc in ten day store of all sort of wine  yet for all this requir not i the bread of the governor  becaus the bondag was heavi upon this peopl  5  19 think upon me  my god  for good  accord to all that i have done for this peopl  6  1 now it came to pass when sanballat  and tobiah  and geshem the arabian  and the rest of our enemi  heard that i had build the wall  and that there was no breach left therein   though at that time i had not set up the door upon the gate  6  2 that sanballat and geshem sent unto me  say  come  let us meet togeth in some one of the villag in the plain of ono  but they thought to do me mischief  6  3 and i sent messeng unto them  say  i am do a great work  so that i cannot come down  whi should the work ceas  whilst i leav it  and come down to you  6  4 yet they sent unto me four time after this sort  and i answer them after the same manner  6  5 then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand  6  6 wherein was written  it is report among the heathen  and gashmu saith it  that thou and the jew think to rebel  for which caus thou buildest the wall  that thou mayest be their king  accord to these word  6  7 and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at jerusalem  say  there is a king in judah  and now shall it be report to the king accord to these word  come now therefor  and let us take counsel togeth  6  8 then i sent unto him  say  there are no such thing done as thou sayest  but thou feignest them out of thine own heart  6  9 for they all made us afraid  say  their hand shall be weaken from the work  that it be not done  now therefor  o god  strengthen my hand  6  10 afterward i came unto the hous of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel  who was shut up  and he said  let us meet togeth in the hous of god  within the templ  and let us shut the door of the templ  for they will come to slay thee  yea  in the night will they come to slay thee  6  11 and i said  should such a man as i flee  and who is there  that  be as i am  would go into the templ to save his life  i will not go in  6  12 and  lo  i perceiv that god had not sent him  but that he pronounc this propheci against me  for tobiah and sanballat had hire him  6  13 therefor was he hire  that i should be afraid  and do so  and sin  and that they might have matter for an evil report  that they might reproach me  6  14 my god  think thou upon tobiah and sanballat accord to these their work  and on the prophetess noadiah  and the rest of the prophet  that would have put me in fear  6  15 so the wall was finish in the twenti and fifth day of the month elul  in fifti and two day  6  16 and it came to pass  that when all our enemi heard thereof  and all the heathen that were about us saw these thing  they were much cast down in their own eye  for they perceiv that this work was wrought of our god  6  17 moreov in those day the nobl of judah sent mani letter unto tobiah  and the letter of tobiah came unto them  6  18 for there were mani in judah sworn unto him  becaus he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah  and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah  6  19 also they report his good deed befor me  and utter my word to him  and tobiah sent letter to put me in fear  7  1 now it came to pass  when the wall was built  and i had set up the door  and the porter and the singer and the levit were appoint  7  2 that i gave my brother hanani  and hananiah the ruler of the palac  charg over jerusalem  for he was a faith man  and fear god abov mani  7  3 and i said unto them  let not the gate of jerusalem be open until the sun be hot  and while they stand by  let them shut the door  and bar them  and appoint watch of the inhabit of jerusalem  everi one in his watch  and everi one to be over against his hous  7  4 now the citi was larg and great  but the peopl were few therein  and the hous were not build  7  5 and my god put into mine heart to gather togeth the nobl  and the ruler  and the peopl  that they might be reckon by genealog  and i found a regist of the

thou hadst sworn to give them  9  16 but they and our father dealt proud  and harden their neck  and hearken not to thi command  9  17 and refus to obey  neither were mind of thi wonder that thou didst among them  but harden their neck  and in their rebellion appoint a captain to return to their bondag  but thou art a god readi to pardon  gracious and merci  slow to anger  and of great kind  and forsookest them not  9  18 yea  when they had made them a molten calf  and said  this is thi god that brought thee up out of egypt  and had wrought great provoc  9  19 yet thou in thi manifold merci forsookest them not in the wilder  the pillar of the cloud depart not from them by day  to lead them in the way  neither the pillar of fire by night  to shew them light  and the way wherein they should go  9  20 thou gavest also thi good spirit to instruct them  and withheldest not thi manna from their mouth  and gavest them water for their thirst  9  21 yea  forti year didst thou sustain

land of sihon  and the land of the king of heshbon  and the land of og king of bashan  9  23 their children also multipliedst thou as the star of heaven  and broughtest them into the land  concern which thou hadst promis to their father  that they should go in to possess it  9  24 so the children went in and possess the land  and thou subduedst befor them the inhabit of the land  the canaanit  and gavest them into their hand  with their king  and the peopl of the land  that they might do with them as they would  9  25 and they took strong citi  and a fat land  and possess hous full of all good  well dig  vineyard  and oliveyard  and fruit tree in abund  so they did eat  and were fill  and becam fat  and delight themselv in thi great good  9  26 nevertheless they were disobedi  and rebel against thee  and cast thi law behind their back  and slew thi prophet which testifi against them to turn them to thee  and they wrought great provoc  9  27 therefor thou deliveredst them into

them out of the hand of their enemi  9  28 but after they had rest  they did evil again befor thee  therefor leftest thou them in the land of their enemi  so that they had the dominion over them  yet when they return  and cri unto thee  thou heardest them from heaven  and mani time didst thou deliv them accord to thi merci  9  29 and testifiedst against them  that thou mightest bring them again unto thi law  yet they dealt proud  and hearken not unto thi command  but sin against thi judgment   which if a man do  he shall live in them  and withdrew the shoulder  and harden their neck  and would not hear  9  30 yet mani year didst thou forbear them  and testifiedst against them by thi spirit in thi prophet  yet would they not give ear  therefor gavest thou them into the hand of the peopl of the land  9  31 nevertheless for thi great merci  sake thou didst not utter consum them  nor forsak them  for thou art a gracious and merci god  9  32 now therefor  our god  the great  the

neither have our king  our princ  our priest  nor our father  kept thi law  nor hearken unto thi command and thi testimoni  wherewith thou didst testifi against them  9  35 for they have not serv thee

not give up the ghost when i came out of the belli  3  12 whi did the knee prevent me  or whi the breast that i should suck  3  13 for now should i have lain still and been quiet  i should have slept  then had i been at rest  3  14 with king and counsellor of the earth  which build desol place for themselv  3  15 or with princ that had gold  who fill their hous with silver  3  16 or as an hidden

day also like the day of an hirel  7  2 as a servant earnest desireth the shadow  and as an hirel looketh for the reward of his work  7  3 so am i made to possess month of vaniti  and wearisom night are appoint to me  7  4 when i lie down  i say  when shall i aris  and the night be gone  and i am full of toss to and fro unto the dawn of the day  7  5 my flesh is cloth with worm and clod of dust  my skin is broken  and becom loathsom  7  6 my day are swifter than a weaver  s shuttl  and are spent without hope  7  7 o rememb that my life is wind  mine eye shall no more see good  7  8 the eye of

let me alon till i swallow down my spittl  7  20 i have sin  what shall i do unto thee  o thou preserv of men  whi hast thou set me as a mark against thee  so that i am a burden to myself  7  21 and whi dost thou not pardon my transgress  and take away my iniqu  for now shall i sleep in the dust  and thou shalt seek me in the morn  but i shall not be  8  1 then answer bildad the shuhit  and said  8  2 how long wilt thou speak these thing  and how long shall the word of thi mouth be like a strong wind  8  3 doth god pervert judgment  or doth the almighti pervert justic  8  4 if thi children have sin against him  and he have cast them away for their transgress  8  5 if thou wouldest seek unto god betim  and make thi supplic to the almighti  8  6 if thou wert pure and upright  sure now he would awak for thee  and make the habit of thi righteous prosper  8  7 though thi begin was small  yet thi latter end should great increas  8  8 for enquir  i pray thee  of the former age  and prepar thyself to the search of their father  8  9  for we are but of yesterday  and know noth  becaus our day upon earth are a shadow  8  10 shall not they teach thee  and tell thee  and utter word out of their heart  8  11 can the rush grow up without mire  can the flag grow without water  8  12 whilst it is yet in his green  and not cut down  it withereth befor ani other herb  8  13 so are the path of all that forget god  and the hypocrit  s hope shall perish  8  14 whose hope shall be cut off  and whose trust shall be a spider  s web  8  15 he shall lean upon his hous  but it shall not stand  he shall hold it fast  but it shall not endur  8  16 he is green befor the sun  and his branch shooteth forth in his garden  8  17 his root are wrap about the heap  and seeth the place of stone  8  18 if he destroy him from his place  then it shall deni him  say  i have not seen thee  8  19 behold  this is the joy of his way  and out of the earth shall other grow  8  20 behold  god will not cast away a perfect man  neither will he help the evil doer  8  21 till he fill thi mouth with laugh  and thi lip with rejoic  8  22 they that hate thee shall be cloth with shame  and the dwell place of the wick shall come to nought  9  1 then job answer and said  9  2 i know it is so of a truth  but how should man be just with god  9  3 if he will contend with him  he cannot answer him one of a thousand  9  4 he is wise in heart  and mighti in strength  who hath harden himself against him  and hath prosper  9  5 which removeth the mountain  and they know not  which overturneth them in his anger  9  6 which shaketh the earth out of her place  and the pillar thereof trembl  9  7 which commandeth the sun  and it riseth not  and sealeth up the star  9  8 which alon spreadeth out the heaven  and treadeth upon the wave of the sea  9  9 which maketh arcturus  orion  and pleiad  and the chamber of the south  9  10 which doeth great thing past find out  yea  and wonder without number  9  11 lo  he goeth by me  and i see him not  he passeth on also  but i perceiv him not  9  12 behold  he taketh away  who can hinder him  who will say unto him  what doest thou  9  13 if god will not withdraw his anger  the proud helper do stoop under him  9  14 how much less shall i answer him  and choos out my word to reason with him  9  15 whom  though i were righteous  yet would i not answer  but i would make supplic to my judg  9  16 if i had call  and he had answer me  yet would i not believ that he had hearken unto my voic  9  17 for he breaketh me with a tempest  and multiplieth my wound without caus  9  18 he will not suffer me to take my breath  but filleth me with bitter  9  19 if i speak of strength  lo  he is strong  and if of judgment  who shall set me a time to plead  9  20 if i justifi myself  mine own mouth shall condemn me  if i say  i am perfect  it shall also prove me pervers  9  21 though i were perfect  yet would i not know my soul  i would despis my life  9  22 this is one thing  therefor i said it  he destroyeth the perfect and the wick  9  23 if the scourg slay sudden  he will laugh at the trial of the innoc  9  24 the earth is given into the hand of the wick  he covereth the face of the judg thereof  if not  where  and who is he  9  25 now my day are swifter than a post  they flee away  they see no good  9  26 they are pass away as the swift ship  as the eagl that hasteth to the prey  9  27 if i say  i will forget my complaint  i will leav off my heavi  and comfort myself  9  28 i am afraid of all my sorrow  i know that thou wilt not hold me innoc  9  29 if i be wick  whi then labour i in vain  9  30 if i wash myself with snow water  and make my hand never so clean  9  31 yet shalt thou plung me in the ditch  and mine own cloth shall abhor me  9  32 for he is not a man  as i am  that i should answer him  and we should come togeth in judgment  9  33 neither is there ani daysman betwixt us  that might lay his hand upon us both  9  34 let him take his rod away from me  and let not his fear terrifi me  9  35 then would i speak  and not fear him  but it is not so with me  10  1 my soul is weari of my life  i will leav my complaint upon myself  i will speak in the bitter of my soul  10  2 i will say unto god  do not condemn me  shew me wherefor thou contendest with me  10  3 is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress  that thou shouldest despis the work of thine hand  and shine upon the counsel of the wick  10  4 hast thou eye of flesh  or seest thou as man seeth  10  5 are thi day as the day of man  are thi year as man  s day  10  6 that thou enquirest after mine iniqu  and searchest after my sin  10  7 thou knowest that i am not wick  and there is none that can deliv out of thine hand  10  8 thine hand have made me and fashion me togeth round about  yet thou dost destroy me  10  9 rememb  i beseech thee  that thou hast made me as the clay  and wilt thou bring me into dust again  10  10 hast thou not pour me out as milk  and curdl me like chees  10  11 thou hast cloth me with skin and flesh  and hast fenc me with bone and sinew  10  12 thou hast grant me life and favour  and thi visit hath preserv my spirit  10  13 and these thing hast thou hid in thine heart  i know that this is with thee  10  14 if i sin  then thou markest me  and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniqu  10  15 if i be wick  woe unto me  and if i be righteous  yet will i not lift up my head  i am full of confus  therefor see thou mine afflict  10  16 for it increaseth  thou huntest me as a fierc lion  and again thou shewest thyself marvel upon me  10  17 thou renewest thi wit against me  and increasest thine indign upon me  chang and war are against me  10  18 wherefor then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb  oh that i had given up the ghost  and no eye had seen me  10  19 i should have been as though i had not been  i should have been carri from the womb to the grave  10  20 are not my day few  ceas then  and let me alon  that i may take comfort a littl  10  21 befor i go whenc i shall not return  even to the land of dark and the shadow of death  10  22 a land of dark  as dark itself  and of the shadow of death  without ani order  and where the light is as dark  11  1 then answer zophar the naamathit  and said  11  2 should not the multitud of word be answer  and should a man full of talk be justifi  11  3 should thi lie make men hold their peac  and when thou mockest  shall no man make thee asham  11  4 for thou hast said  my doctrin is pure  and i am clean in thine eye  11  5 but oh that god would speak  and open his lip against thee  11  6 and that he would shew thee the secret of wisdom  that they are doubl to that which is  know therefor that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniqu deserveth  11  7 canst thou by search find out god  canst thou find out the almighti unto perfect  11  8 it is as high as heaven  what canst thou do  deeper than hell  what canst thou know  11  9 the measur thereof is longer than the earth  and broader than the sea  11  10 if he cut off  and shut up  or gather togeth  then who can hinder him  11  11 for he knoweth vain men  he seeth wicked also  will he not then consid it  11  12 for vain men would be wise  though man be born like a wild ass  s colt  11  13 if thou prepar thine heart  and stretch out thine hand toward him  11  14 if iniqu be in thine hand  put it far away  and let not wicked dwell in thi tabernacl  11  15 for then shalt thou lift up thi face without spot  yea  thou shalt be stedfast  and shalt not fear  11  16 becaus thou shalt forget thi miseri  and rememb it as water that pass away  11  17 and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday  thou shalt shine forth  thou shalt be as the morn  11  18 and thou shalt be secur  becaus there is hope  yea  thou shalt dig about thee  and thou shalt take thi rest in safeti  11  19 also thou shalt lie down  and none shall make thee afraid  yea  mani shall make suit unto thee  11  20 but the eye of the wick shall fail  and they shall not escap  and their hope shall be as the give up of the ghost  12  1 and job answer and said  12  2 no doubt but ye are the peopl  and wisdom shall die with you  12  3 but i have understand as well as you  i am not inferior to you  yea  who knoweth not such thing as these  12  4 i am as one mock of his neighbour  who calleth upon god  and he answereth him  the just upright man is laugh to scorn  12  5 he that is readi to slip with his feet is as a lamp despis in the thought of him that is at eas  12  6 the tabernacl of robber prosper  and they that provok god are secur  into whose hand god bringeth abund  12  7 but ask now the beast  and they shall teach thee  and the fowl of the air  and they shall tell thee  12  8 or speak to the earth  and it shall teach thee  and the fish of the sea shall declar unto thee  12  9 who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this  12  10 in whose hand is the soul of everi live thing  and the breath of all mankind  12  11 doth not the ear tri word  and the mouth tast his meat  12  12 with the ancient is wisdom  and in length of day understand  12  13 with him is wisdom and strength  he hath counsel and understand  12  14 behold  he breaketh down  and it cannot be built again  he shutteth up a man  and there can be no open  12  15 behold  he withholdeth the water  and they dri up  also he sendeth them out  and they overturn the earth  12  16 with him is strength and wisdom  the deceiv and the deceiv are his  12  17 he leadeth counsellor away spoil  and maketh the judg fool  12  18 he looseth the bond of king  and girdeth their loin with a girdl  12  19 he leadeth princ away spoil  and overthroweth the mighti  12  20 he removeth away the speech

13  7 will ye speak wick for god  and talk deceit for him  13  8 will ye accept his person  will ye contend for god  13  9 is it good that he should search you out  or as one man mocketh anoth  do ye

thing unto me  then will i not hide myself from thee  13  21 withdraw thine hand far from me  and let not thi dread make me afraid  13  22 then call thou  and i will answer  or let me speak  and answer thou me  13  23 how mani are mine iniqu and sin  make me to know my transgress and my sin  13  24 wherefor hidest thou thi face  and holdest me for thine enemi  13  25 wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro  and wilt thou pursu the dri stubbl  13  26 for thou writest bitter thing against me  and makest me to possess the iniqu of my youth  13  27 thou puttest my feet also in the stock  and lookest narrowli unto all my path  thou settest a print upon the heel of my feet  13  28 and he  as a rotten thing  consumeth  as a garment that is moth eaten  14  1 man that is born of a woman is of few day and full of troubl  14  2 he cometh forth like a flower  and is cut down  he fleeth also as a shadow  and continueth not  14  3 and doth thou open thine eye upon such an one  and bringest me into judgment with thee  14  4 who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean  not one  14  5 see his day are determin  the number of his month are with thee  thou hast appoint his bound that he cannot pass  14  6 turn from him  that he may rest  till he shall accomplish  as an hirel  his day  14  7 for there is hope of a tree  if it be cut down  that it will sprout again  and that the tender branch thereof will not ceas  14  8 though the root thereof wax old in the earth  and the stock thereof die in the ground  14  9 yet through the scent of water it will bud  and bring forth bough like a plant  14  10 but man dieth  and wasteth away  yea  man giveth up the ghost  and where is he  14  11 as the water fail from the sea  and the flood decayeth and drieth up  14  12 so man lieth down  and riseth not  till the heaven be no more  they shall not awak  nor be rais out of their sleep  14  13 o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave  that thou wouldest keep me secret  until thi wrath be past  that thou wouldest appoint me a set time  and rememb me  14  14 if a man die  shall he live again  all the day of my appoint time will i wait  till my chang come  14  15 thou shalt call  and i

mine iniqu  14  18 and sure the mountain fall cometh to nought  and the rock is remov out of his place  14  19 the water wear the stone  thou washest away the thing which grow out of the dust of the earth  and thou destroyest the hope of man  14  20 thou prevailest for ever against him  and he passeth  thou changest his counten  and sendest him away  14  21 his son come to honour  and he knoweth it not  and they are brought low  but he perceiveth it not of them  14  22 but his flesh upon him shall have pain  and his soul within him shall mourn  15  1 then answer eliphaz the temanit  and said  15  2 should a wise man utter vain knowledg  and fill his belli with the east wind  15  3 should he reason with unprofit talk  or with speech wherewith he can do no good  15  4 yea  thou castest off fear  and restrainest prayer befor god  15  5 for thi mouth uttereth thine iniqu  and thou choosest the tongu of the crafti  15  6 thine own mouth condemneth thee  and not i  yea  thine own lip testifi against thee  15  7 art thou the first man that was born  or wast thou made befor the hill  15  8 hast thou heard the secret of god  and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself  15  9 what knowest thou  that we know not  what understandest thou  which is not in us  15  10 with us are both the grayhead and veri age men  much elder than thi father  15  11 are the consol of god small with thee  is there ani secret thing with thee  15  12 whi doth thine heart carri thee away  and what do thi eye wink at  15  13 that thou turnest thi spirit against god  and lettest such word go out of thi mouth  15  14 what is man  that he should be clean  and he which is born of a woman  that he should be righteous  15  15 behold  he putteth no trust in his saint  yea  the heaven are not clean in his sight  15  16 how much more abomin and filthi is man  which drinketh iniqu like water  15  17 i will shew thee  hear me  and that which i have seen i will declar  15  18 which wise men have told from their father  and have not hid it  15  19 unto whom alon the earth was given  and no stranger pass among them  15  20 the wick man travaileth with pain all his day  and the number of year is hidden to the oppressor  15  21 a dread sound is in his ear  in prosper the destroy shall come upon him  15  22 he believeth not that he shall return out of dark  and he is wait for of the sword  15  23 he wandereth abroad for bread  say  where is it  he knoweth that the day of dark is readi at his hand  15  24 troubl and anguish shall make him afraid  they shall prevail against him  as a king readi to the battl  15  25 for he stretcheth out his hand against god  and strengtheneth himself against the almighti  15  26 he runneth upon him  even on his neck  upon the thick boss of his buckler  15  27 becaus he covereth his face with his fat  and maketh collop of fat on his flank  15  28 and he dwelleth in desol citi  and in hous which no man inhabiteth  which are readi to becom heap  15  29 he shall not be rich  neither shall his substanc continu  neither shall he prolong the perfect thereof upon the earth  15  30 he shall not depart out of dark  the flame shall dri up his branch  and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away  15  31 let not him that is deceiv trust in vaniti  for vaniti shall be his recomp  15  32 it shall be accomplish befor his time  and his branch shall not be green  15  33 he shall shake off his unrip grape as the vine  and shall cast off his flower as the oliv  15  34 for the congreg of hypocrit shall be desol  and fire shall consum the tabernacl of briberi  15  35 they conceiv mischief  and bring forth vaniti  and their belli prepareth deceit  16  1 then job answer and said  16  2 i have heard mani such thing  miser comfort are ye all  16  3 shall vain word have an end  or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest  16  4 i also could speak as ye do  if your soul were in my soul  s stead  i could heap up word against you  and shake mine

reproach  they have gather themselv togeth against me  16  11 god hath deliv me to the ungod  and turn me over into the hand of the wick  16  12 i was at eas  but he hath broken me asund  he hath also taken me by my neck  and shaken me to piec  and set me up for his mark  16  13 his archer compass me round about  he cleaveth my rein asund  and doth not spare  he poureth out my gall upon the ground  16  14 he breaketh me with breach upon breach  he runneth upon me like a giant  16  15 i have sew sackcloth upon my skin  and defil my horn in the dust  16  16 my face is foul with weep  and on my eyelid is the shadow of death  16  17 not for ani injustic in mine hand  also my prayer is pure  16  18 o earth  cover not thou my blood  and let my cri have no place  16  19 also now  behold  my wit is in heaven  and my record is on high  16  20 my friend scorn me  but mine eye poureth out tear unto god  16  21 o that one might plead for a man with god  as a man pleadeth for his neighbour  16  22 when a few year are come  then i shall go the way whenc i shall not return  17  1 my breath is corrupt  my day are extinct  the grave are readi for me  17  2 are there not mocker with me  and doth not

also is dim by reason of sorrow  and all my member are as a shadow  17  8 upright men shall be astoni at this  and the innoc shall stir up himself against the hypocrit  17  9 the righteous also shall hold on his way  and he that hath clean hand shall be stronger and stronger  17  10 but as for you all  do ye return  and come now  for i cannot find one wise man among you  17  11 my day are past  my purpos are broken off  even the thought of my heart  17  12 they chang the night into day  the light is short becaus of dark  17  13 if i wait  the grave is mine hous  i have made my bed in the dark  17  14 i have said to corrupt  thou art my father  to the worm  thou art my mother  and my sister  17  15 and where is now my hope  as for my hope  who shall see it  17  16 they shall go down to the bar of the pit  when our rest togeth is in the dust  18  1 then answer bildad the shuhit  and said  18  2 how long will it be ere ye make an end of word  mark  and afterward we will speak  18  3 wherefor are we count as beast  and reput vile in your sight  18  4 he teareth himself in his anger  shall the earth be forsaken for thee  and shall the rock be remov out of his place  18  5 yea  the light of the wick shall be put out  and the spark of his fire shall not shine  18  6 the light shall be dark in his tabernacl  and his candl shall be put out with him  18  7 the step of his strength shall be straiten  and his own counsel shall cast him down  18  8 for he is cast into a net by his own feet  and he walketh upon a snare  18  9 the gin shall take him by the heel  and the robber shall prevail against him  18  10 the snare is laid for him in the ground  and a trap for him in the way  18  11 terror shall make him afraid on everi side  and shall drive him to his feet  18  12 his strength shall be hungerbitten  and destruct shall be readi at his side  18  13 it shall devour the strength of his skin  even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength  18  14 his confid shall

and chase out of the world  18  19 he shall neither have son nor nephew among his peopl  nor ani remain in his dwell  18  20 they that come after him shall be astoni at his day  as they that went befor were affright  18  21 sure such are the dwell of the wick  and this is the place of him that knoweth not god  19  1 then job answer and said  19  2 how long will ye vex my soul  and break me in piec with word  19  3 these ten time have ye reproach me  ye are not asham that ye make yourselv strang to me  19  4 and be it inde that i have er  mine error remaineth with myself  19  5 if inde ye

hath destroy me on everi side  and i am gone  and mine hope hath he remov like a tree  19  11 he hath also kindl his wrath against me  and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemi  19  12 his troop come togeth  and rais up their way against me  and encamp round about my tabernacl  19  13 he hath put my brethren far from me  and mine acquaint are verili estrang from me  19  14 my kinsfolk have fail  and my familiar friend have forgotten me  19  15 they that dwell in mine hous  and my maid  count me for a stranger  i am an alien in their sight  19  16 i call my servant  and he gave me no

that they were print in a book  19  24 that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever  19  25 for i know that my redeem liveth  and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth  19  26 and though after my skin worm destroy this bodi  yet in my flesh shall i see god  19  27 whom i shall see for myself  and mine eye shall behold  and not anoth  though my rein be consum within me  19  28 but ye should say  whi persecut we him  see the root of the matter is found in me  19  29 be ye afraid of the sword  for wrath bringeth the punish of the sword  that ye may know there is a judgment  20  1 then answer zophar the naamathit  and said  20  2 therefor do my thought caus me to answer  and for this i make hast  20  3 i have heard the check of my reproach  and the spirit of my understand causeth me to answer  20  4 knowest thou not this of old  sinc man was place upon earth  20  5 that the triumph of the wick is short  and the joy of the hypocrit but for a moment  20  6 though his excel mount up to the heaven  and his head reach unto the cloud  20  7 yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung  they which have seen him shall say  where is he  20  8 he shall fli away as a dream  and shall not be found  yea  he shall be chase away as a vision of the night  20  9 the eye also which saw him shall see him no more  neither shall his place ani more behold him  20  10 his children shall seek to pleas the poor  and his hand shall restor their good  20  11 his bone are full of the sin of his youth  which shall lie down with him in the dust  20  12 though wicked be sweet in his mouth  though he hide it under his tongu  20  13 though he spare it  and forsak it not  but keep it still within his mouth  20  14 yet his meat in his bowel is turn  it is the gall of asp within him  20  15 he hath swallow down rich  and he shall vomit them up again  god shall cast them out of his belli  20  16 he shall suck the poison of asp  the viper  s tongu shall slay him  20  17 he shall not see the river  the flood  the brook of honey and butter  20  18 that which he labour for shall he restor  and shall not swallow it down  accord to his substanc shall the restitut be  and he shall not rejoic therein  20  19 becaus he hath oppress and hath forsaken the poor  becaus he hath violent taken away an hous which he build not  20  20 sure he shall not feel quiet in his belli  he shall not save of that which he desir  20  21 there shall none of his meat be left  therefor shall no man look for his good  20  22 in the ful of his suffici he shall be in strait  everi hand of the wick shall come upon him  20  23 when he is about to fill his belli  god shall cast the furi of his wrath upon him  and shall rain it upon him while he is eat  20  24 he shall flee from the iron weapon  and the bow of steel shall strike him through  20  25 it is drawn  and cometh out of the bodi  yea  the glitter sword cometh out of his gall  terror are upon him  20  26 all dark shall be hid in his secret place  a fire not blown shall consum him  it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacl  20  27 the heaven shall reveal his iniqu  and the earth shall rise up against him  20  28 the increas of his hous shall depart  and his good shall flow away in the day of his wrath  20  29 this is the portion of a wick man from god  and the heritag appoint unto him by god  21  1 but job answer and said  21  2 hear dilig my speech  and let this be your consol  21  3 suffer me that i may speak  and after that i have spoken  mock on  21  4 as for me  is my complaint to man  and if it were so  whi should not my spirit be troubl  21  5 mark me  and be astonish  and lay your hand upon your mouth  21  6 even when i rememb i am afraid  and trembl taketh hold on my flesh  21  7 wherefor do the wick live  becom old  yea  are mighti in power  21  8 their seed is establish in their sight with them  and their offspr befor their eye  21  9 their hous are safe from fear  neither is the rod of god upon them  21  10 their bull gendereth  and faileth not  their cow calveth  and casteth not her calf  21  11 they send forth their littl one like a flock  and their children danc  21  12 they take the timbrel and harp  and rejoic at the sound of the organ  21  13 they spend their day in wealth  and in a moment go down to the grave  21  14 therefor they say unto god  depart from us  for we desir not the knowledg of thi way  21  15 what is the almighti  that we should serv him  and what profit should we have  if we pray unto him  21  16 lo  their good is not in their hand  the counsel of the wick is far from me  21  17 how oft is the candl of the wick put out  and how oft cometh their destruct upon them  god distributeth sorrow in his anger  21  18 they are as stubbl befor the wind  and as chaff that the storm carrieth away  21  19 god layeth up his iniqu for his children  he rewardeth him  and he shall know it  21  20 his eye shall see his destruct  and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighti  21  21 for what pleasur hath he in his hous after him  when the number of his month is cut off in the midst  21  22 shall ani teach god knowledg  see he judgeth those that are high  21  23 one dieth in his full strength  be wholli at eas and quiet  21  24 his breast are full of milk  and his bone are moisten with marrow  21  25 and anoth dieth in the bitter of his soul  and never eateth with pleasur  21  26 they shall lie down alik in the dust  and the worm shall cover them  21  27 behold  i know your thought  and the devic which ye wrong imagin against me  21  28 for ye say  where is the hous of the princ  and where are the dwell place of the wick  21  29 have ye not ask them that go by the way  and do ye not know their token  21  30 that the wick is reserv to the day of destruct  they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath  21  31 who shall declar his way to his face  and who shall repay him what he hath done  21  32 yet shall he be brought to the grave  and shall remain in the tomb  21  33 the clod of the valley shall be sweet unto him  and everi man shall draw after him  as there are innumer befor him  21  34 how then comfort ye me in vain  see in your answer there remaineth falsehood  22  1 then eliphaz the temanit answer and said  22  2 can a man be profit unto god  as he that is wise may be profit unto himself  22  3 is it ani pleasur to the almighti  that thou art righteous  or is it gain to him  that thou makest thi way perfect  22  4 will he reprov thee for fear of thee  will he enter with thee into judgment  22  5 is not thi wicked great  and thine iniqu infinit  22  6 for thou hast taken a pledg from thi brother for nought  and strip the nake of their cloth  22  7 thou hast not given water to the weari to drink  and thou hast withholden bread from the hungri  22  8 but as for the mighti man  he had the earth  and the honour man dwelt in it  22  9 thou hast sent widow away empti  and the arm of the fatherless have been broken  22  10 therefor snare are round about thee  and sudden fear troubleth thee  22  11 or dark  that thou canst not see  and abund of water cover thee  22  12 is not god in the height of heaven  and behold the height of the star  how high they are  22  13 and thou sayest  how doth god know  can he judg through the dark cloud  22  14 thick cloud are a cover to him  that he seeth not  and he walketh in the circuit of heaven  22  15 hast thou mark the old way which wick men have trodden  22  16 which were cut down out of time  whose foundat was overflown with a flood  22  17 which said unto god  depart from us  and what can the almighti do for them  22  18 yet he fill their hous with good thing  but the counsel of the wick is far from me  22  19 the righteous see it  and are glad  and the innoc laugh them to scorn  22  20 wherea our substanc is not cut down  but the remnant of them the fire consumeth  22  21 acquaint now thyself with him  and be at peac  therebi good shall come unto thee  22  22 receiv  i pray thee  the law from his mouth  and lay up his word in thine heart  22  23 if thou return to the almighti  thou shalt be built up  thou shalt put away iniqu far from thi tabernacl  22  24 then shalt thou lay up gold as dust  and the gold of ophir as the stone of the brook  22  25 yea  the almighti shall be thi defenc  and thou shalt have plenti of silver  22  26 for then shalt thou have thi delight in the almighti  and shalt lift up thi face unto god  22  27 thou shalt make thi prayer unto him  and he shall hear thee  and thou shalt pay thi vow  22  28 thou shalt also decre a thing  and it shall be establish unto thee  and the light shall shine upon thi way  22  29 when men are cast down  then thou shalt say  there is lift up  and he shall save the humbl person  22  30 he shall deliv the island of the innoc  and it is deliv by the pure of thine hand  23  1 then job answer and said  23  2 even to day is my complaint bitter  my stroke is heavier than my groan  23  3 oh that i knew where i might find him  that i might come even to his seat  23  4 i would order my caus befor him  and fill my mouth with argument  23  5 i would know the word which he would answer me  and understand what he would say unto me  23  6 will he plead against me with his great power  no  but he would put strength in me  23  7 there the righteous might disput with him  so should i be deliv for ever from my judg  23  8 behold  i go forward  but he is not there  and backward  but i cannot perceiv him  23  9 on the left hand  where he doth work  but i cannot behold him  he hideth himself on the right hand  that i cannot see him  23  10 but he knoweth the way that i take  when he hath tri me  i shall come forth as gold  23  11 my foot hath held his step  his way have i kept  and not declin  23  12 neither have i gone back from the command of his lip  i have esteem the word of his mouth more than my necessari food  23  13 but he is in one mind  and who can turn him  and what his soul desireth  even that he doeth  23  14 for he performeth the thing that is appoint for me  and mani such thing are with him  23  15 therefor am i troubl at his presenc  when i consid  i am afraid of him  23  16 for god maketh my heart soft  and the almighti troubleth me  23  17 becaus i was not cut off befor the dark  neither hath he cover

when his candl shine upon my head  and when by his light i walk through dark  29  4 as i was in the day of my youth  when the secret of god was upon my tabernacl  29  5 when the almighti was yet with me  when my children were about me  29  6 when i wash my step with butter  and the rock pour me out river of oil  29  7 when i went out to the gate through the citi  when i prepar my seat in the street  29  8 the young men saw me  and hid themselv  and the age aros  and stood up  29  9 the princ refrain talk  and laid their hand on their mouth  29  10 the nobl held their peac  and their tongu cleav to the roof of their mouth  29  11 when the ear heard me  then it bless me  and when the eye saw me  it gave wit to me  29  12 becaus i deliv the poor that cri  and the fatherless  and him that had none to help him  29  13 the bless of him that was readi to perish came upon me  and i caus the widow  s heart to sing for joy  29  14 i put on righteous  and it cloth me  my judgment was as a robe and a diadem  29  15 i was eye to the blind  and feet was i to the lame  29  16 i was a father to the poor  and the caus which i knew not i search out  29  17 and i brake the jaw of the wick  and pluck the spoil out of his teeth  29  18 then i said  i shall die in my nest  and i shall multipli my day as the sand  29  19 my root was spread out by the water  and the dew lay all night upon my branch  29  20 my glori was fresh in me  and my bow was renew in my hand  29  21 unto me men gave ear  and wait  and kept silenc at my counsel  29  22 after my word they spake not again  and my speech drop upon them  29  23 and they wait for me as for the rain  and they open their mouth wide as for the latter rain  29  24 if i laugh on them  they believ it not  and the light of my counten they cast not down  29  25 i chose out their way  and sat chief  and dwelt as a king in the armi  as one that comforteth the mourner  30  1 but now they that are younger than i have me in deris  whose father i would have disdain to have set with the dog of my flock  30  2 yea  whereto might the strength of their hand profit me  in whom old age was perish  30  3 for want and famin they were solitari  flee into the wilder in former time desol and wast  30  4 who cut up mallow by the bush  and junip root for their meat  30  5 they were driven forth from among men   they cri after them as after a thief  30  6 to dwell in the cliff of the valley  in cave of the earth  and in the rock  30  7 among the bush they bray  under the nettl they were gather togeth  30  8 they were children of fool  yea  children of base men  they were viler than the earth  30  9 and now am i their song  yea  i am their byword  30  10 they abhor me  they flee far from me  and spare not to spit in my face  30  11 becaus he hath loos my cord  and afflict me  they have also let loos the bridl befor me  30  12 upon my right hand rise the youth  they push away my feet  and they rais up against me the way of their destruct  30  13 they mar my path  they set forward my calam  they have no helper  30  14 they came upon me as a wide break in of water  in the desol they roll themselv upon me  30  15 terror are turn upon me  they pursu my soul as the wind  and my welfar passeth away as a cloud  30  16 and now my soul is pour out upon me  the day of afflict have taken hold upon me  30  17 my bone are pierc in me in the night season  and my sinew take no rest  30  18 by the great forc of my diseas is my garment chang  it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat  30  19 he hath cast me into the mire  and i am

me  30  22 thou liftest me up to the wind  thou causest me to ride upon it  and dissolvest my substanc  30  23 for i know that thou wilt bring me to death  and to the hous appoint for all live  30  24 howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave  though they cri in his destruct  30  25 did not i weep for him that was in troubl  was not my soul griev for the poor  30  26 when i look for good  then evil came unto me  and when i wait for light  there came dark  30  27 my bowel boil  and rest not  the day of afflict prevent me  30  28 i went mourn without the sun  i stood up  and i cri in the congreg  30  29 i am a brother to dragon  and a companion to owl  30  30 my skin is black upon me  and my bone are burn with heat  30  31 my harp also is turn to mourn  and my organ into the voic of them that weep  31  1 i made a coven with mine eye  whi then should i think upon a maid  31  2 for what portion of god is there from abov  and what inherit of the almighti from on high  31  3 is not destruct to the wick  and a strang punish to the worker of iniqu  31  4 doth not he see my way  and count all my step  31  5 if i have walk with vaniti  or if my foot hath hast to deceit  31  6 let me be weigh in an even balanc that god may know mine integr  31  7 if my step hath turn out of the way  and mine heart walk after mine eye  and if ani blot hath cleav to mine hand  31  8 then let me sow  and let anoth eat  yea  let my offspr be root out  31  9 if mine heart have been deceiv by a woman  or if i have laid wait at my neighbour  s door  31  10 then let my wife grind unto anoth  and let other bow down upon her  31  11 for this is an heinous crime  yea  it is an iniqu to be punish by the judg  31  12 for it is a fire that consumeth to destruct  and would root out all mine increas  31  13 if i did despis the caus of my manserv or of my maidserv  when they contend with me  31  14 what then shall i do when god riseth up  and when he visiteth  what shall i answer him  31  15 did not he that made me in the womb make him  and did not one fashion us in the womb  31  16 if i have withheld the poor from their desir  or have caus the eye of the widow to fail  31  17 or have eaten my morsel myself alon  and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof  31  18  for from my youth he was brought up with me  as with a father  and i have guid her from my mother  s womb  31  19 if i have seen ani perish for want of cloth  or ani poor without cover  31  20 if his loin have not bless me  and if he were not warm with the fleec of my sheep  31  21 if i have lift up my hand against the fatherless  when i saw my help in the gate  31  22 then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade  and mine arm be broken from the bone  31  23 for destruct from god was a terror to me  and by reason of his high i could not endur  31  24 if i have made gold my hope  or have said to the fine gold  thou art my confid  31  25 if i rejoic becaus my wealth was great  and becaus mine hand had gotten much  31  26 if i beheld the sun when it shine  or the moon walk in bright  31  27 and my heart hath been secret entic  or my mouth hath kiss my hand  31  28 this also were an iniqu to be punish by the judg  for i should have deni the god that is abov  31  29 if i rejoic at the destruct of him that hate me  or lift up myself when evil found him  31  30 neither have i suffer my mouth to sin by wish a curs to his soul  31  31 if the men of my tabernacl said not  oh that we had of his flesh  we cannot be satisfi  31  32 the stranger did not lodg in the street  but i open my door to the travel  31  33 if i cover my transgress as adam  by hide mine iniqu in my bosom  31  34 did i fear a great multitud  or did the contempt of famili terrifi me  that i kept silenc  and went not out of the door  31  35 oh that one would hear me  behold  my desir is  that the almighti would answer me  and that mine adversari had written a book  31  36 sure i would take it upon my shoulder  and bind it as a crown to me  31  37 i would declar unto him the number of my step  as a princ would i go near unto him  31  38 if my land cri against me  or that the furrow likewis thereof complain  31  39 if i have eaten the fruit thereof without money  or have caus the owner thereof to lose their life  31  40 let thistl grow instead of wheat  and cockl instead of barley  the word of job are end  32  1 so these three men ceas to answer job  becaus he was righteous in his own eye  32  2 then was kindl the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzit  of the kindr of ram  against job was his wrath kindl  becaus he justifi himself rather than god  32  3 also against his three friend was his wrath kindl  becaus they had found no answer  and yet had condemn job  32  4 now elihu had wait till job had spoken  becaus they were elder than he  32  5 when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men  then his wrath was kindl  32  6 and elihu the son of barachel the buzit answer and said  i am young  and ye are veri old  wherefor i was afraid  and durst not shew you mine opinion  32  7 i said  day should speak  and multitud of year should teach wisdom  32  8 but there is a spirit in man  and the inspir of the almighti giveth them understand  32  9 great men are not alway wise  neither do the age understand judgment  32  10 therefor i said  hearken to me  i also will shew mine opinion  32  11 behold  i wait for your word  i gave ear to your reason  whilst ye search out what to say  32  12 yea  i attend unto you  and  behold  there was none of you that convinc job  or that answer his word  32  13 lest ye should say  we have found out wisdom  god thrusteth him down  not man  32  14 now he hath not direct his word against me  neither will i answer him with your speech  32  15 they were amaz  they answer no more  they left off speak  32  16 when i had wait   for they spake not  but stood still  and answer no more  32  17 i said  i will answer also my part  i also will shew mine opinion  32  18 for i am full of matter  the spirit within me constraineth me  32  19 behold  my belli is as wine which hath no vent  it is readi to burst like new bottl  32  20 i will speak  that i may be refresh  i will open my lip and answer  32  21 let me not  i pray you  accept ani man  s person  neither let me give flatter titl unto man  32  22 for i know not to give flatter titl  in so do my maker would soon take me away  33  1 wherefor  job  i pray thee  hear my speech  and hearken to all my word  33  2 behold  now i have open my mouth  my tongu hath spoken in my mouth  33  3 my word shall be of the upright of my heart  and my lip shall utter knowledg clear  33  4 the spirit of god hath made me  and the breath of the almighti hath given me life  33  5 if thou canst answer me  set thi word in order befor me  stand up  33  6 behold  i am accord to thi wish in god  s stead  i also am form out of the clay  33  7 behold  my terror shall not make thee afraid  neither shall my hand be heavi upon thee  33  8 sure thou hast spoken in mine hear  and i have heard the voic of thi word  say  33  9 i am clean without transgress  i am innoc  neither is there iniqu in me  33  10 behold  he findeth occas against me  he counteth me for his enemi  33  11 he putteth my feet in the stock  he marketh all my path  33  12 behold  in this thou art not just  i will answer thee  that god is greater than man  33  13 whi dost thou strive against him  for he giveth not account of ani of his matter  33  14 for god speaketh onc  yea twice  yet man perceiveth it not  33  15 in a dream  in a vision of the night  when deep sleep falleth upon men  in slumber upon the bed  33  16 then he openeth the ear of men  and sealeth their instruct  33  17 that he may withdraw man from his purpos  and hide pride from man  33  18 he keepeth back his soul from the pit  and his life from perish by the sword  33  19 he is chasten also with pain upon his bed  and the multitud of his bone with strong pain  33  20 so that his life abhorreth bread  and his soul dainti meat  33  21 his flesh is consum away  that it cannot be seen  and his bone that were not seen stick out  33  22 yea  his soul draweth near unto the grave  and his life to the destroy  33  23 if there be a messeng with him  an interpret  one among a thousand  to shew unto man his upright  33  24 then he is gracious unto him  and saith  deliv him from go down to the pit  i have found a ransom  33  25 his flesh shall be fresher than a child  s  he shall return to the day of his youth  33  26 he shall pray unto god  and he will be favour unto him  and he shall see his face with joy  for he will render unto man his righteous  33  27 he looketh upon men  and if ani say  i have sin  and pervert that which was right  and it profit me not  33  28 he will deliv his soul from go into the pit  and his life shall see the light  33  29 lo  all these thing worketh god oftentim with man  33  30 to bring back his soul from the pit  to be enlighten with the light of the live  33  31 mark well  o job  hearken unto me  hold thi peac  and i will speak  33  32 if thou hast anyth to say  answer me  speak  for i desir to justifi thee  33  33 if not  hearken unto me  hold thi peac  and i shall teach thee wisdom  34  1 furthermor elihu answer and said  34  2 hear my word  o ye wise men  and give ear unto me  ye that have knowledg  34  3 for the ear trieth word  as the mouth tasteth meat  34  4 let us choos to us judgment  let us know among ourselv what is good  34  5 for job hath said  i am righteous  and god hath taken away my judgment  34  6 should i lie against my right  my wound is incur without transgress  34  7 what man is like job  who drinketh up scorn like water  34  8 which goeth in compani with the worker of iniqu  and walketh with wick men  34  9 for he hath said  it profiteth a man noth that he should delight himself with god  34  10 therefor hearken unto me ye men of understand  far be it from god  that he should do wicked  and from the almighti  that he should commit iniqu  34  11 for the work of a man shall he render unto him  and caus everi man to find accord to his way  34  12 yea  sure god will not do wick  neither will the almighti pervert judgment  34  13 who hath given him a charg over the earth  or who hath dispos the whole world  34  14 if he set his heart upon man  if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath  34  15 all flesh shall perish togeth  and man shall turn again unto dust  34  16 if now thou hast understand  hear this  hearken to the voic of my word  34  17 shall even he that hateth right govern  and wilt thou condemn him that is most just  34  18 is it fit to say to a king  thou art wick  and to princ  ye are ungod  34  19 how much less to him that accepteth not the person of princ  nor regardeth the rich more than the poor  for they all are the work of his hand  34  20 in a moment shall they die  and the peopl shall be troubl at midnight  and pass away  and the mighti shall be taken away without hand  34  21 for his eye are upon the way of man  and he seeth all his go  34  22 there is no dark  nor shadow of death  where the worker of iniqu may hide themselv  34  23 for he will not lay upon man more than right  that he should enter into judgment with god  34  24 he shall break in piec mighti men without number  and set other in their stead  34  25 therefor he knoweth their work  and he overturneth them in the night  so that they are destroy  34  26 he striketh them as wick men in the open sight of other  34  27 becaus they turn back from him  and would not consid ani of his way  34  28 so that they caus the cri of the poor to come unto him  and he heareth the cri of the afflict  34  29 when he giveth quiet  who then can make troubl  and when he hideth his face  who then can behold him  whether it be done against a nation  or against a man onli  34  30 that the hypocrit reign not  lest the peopl be ensnar  34  31 sure it is meet to be said unto god  i have born chastis  i will not offend ani more  34  32 that which i see not teach thou me  if i have done iniqu  i will do no more  34  33 should it be accord to thi mind  he will recompens it  whether thou refus  or whether thou choos  and not i  therefor speak what thou knowest  34  34 let men of understand tell me  and let a wise man hearken unto me  34  35 job hath spoken without knowledg  and his word were without wisdom  34  36 my desir is that job may be tri unto the end becaus of his answer for wick men  34  37 for he addeth rebellion unto his sin  he clappeth his hand among us  and multiplieth his word against god  35  1 elihu spake moreov  and said  35  2 thinkest thou this to be right  that thou saidst  my righteous is more than god  s  35  3 for thou saidst  what advantag will it be unto thee  and  what profit shall i have  if i be cleans from my sin  35  4 i will answer thee  and thi companion with thee  35  5 look unto the heaven  and see  and behold the cloud which are higher than thou  35  6 if thou sinnest  what doest thou against him  or if thi transgress be multipli  what doest thou unto him  35  7 if thou be righteous  what givest thou him  or what receiveth he of thine hand  35  8 thi wicked may hurt a man as thou art  and thi righteous may profit the son of man  35  9 by reason of the multitud of oppress they make the oppress to cri  they cri out by reason of the arm of the mighti  35  10 but none saith  where is god my maker  who giveth song in the night  35  11 who teacheth us more than the beast of the earth  and maketh us wiser than the fowl of heaven  35  12 there they cri  but none giveth answer  becaus of the pride of evil men  35  13 sure god will not hear vaniti  neither will the almighti regard it  35  14 although thou sayest thou shalt not see him  yet judgment is befor him  therefor trust thou in him  35  15 but now  becaus it is not so  he hath visit in his anger  yet he knoweth it not in great extrem  35  16 therefor doth job open his mouth in vain  he multiplieth word without knowledg  36  1 elihu also proceed  and said  36  2 suffer me a littl  and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god  s behalf  36  3 i will fetch my knowledg from afar  and will ascrib righteous to my maker  36  4 for truli my word shall not be fals  he that is perfect in knowledg is with thee  36  5 behold  god is mighti  and despiseth not ani  he is mighti in strength and wisdom  36  6 he preserveth not the life of the wick  but giveth right to the poor  36  7 he withdraweth not his eye from the righteous  but with king are they on the throne  yea  he doth establish them for ever  and they are exalt  36  8 and if they be bound in fetter  and be holden in cord of afflict  36  9 then he sheweth them their work  and their transgress that they have exceed  36  10 he openeth also their ear to disciplin  and commandeth that they return from iniqu  36  11 if they obey and serv him  they shall spend their day in prosper  and their year in pleasur  36  12 but if they obey not  they shall perish by the sword  and they shall die without knowledg  36  13 but the hypocrit in heart heap up wrath  they cri not when he bindeth them  36  14 they die in youth  and their life is among the unclean  36  15 he delivereth the poor in his afflict  and openeth their ear in oppress  36  16 even so would he have remov thee out of the strait into a broad place  where there is no strait  and that which should be set on thi tabl should be full of fat  36  17 but thou hast fulfil the judgment of the wick  judgment and justic take hold on thee  36  18 becaus there is wrath  bewar lest he take thee away with his stroke  then a great ransom cannot deliv thee  36  19 will he esteem thi rich  no  not gold  nor all the forc of strength  36  20 desir not the night  when peopl are cut off in their place  36  21 take heed  regard not iniqu  for this hast thou chosen rather than afflict  36  22 behold  god exalteth by his power  who teacheth like him  36  23 who hath enjoin him his way  or who can say  thou hast wrought iniqu  36  24 rememb that thou magnifi his work  which men behold  36  25 everi man may see it  man may behold it afar off  36  26 behold  god is great  and we know him not  neither can the number of his year be search out  36  27 for he maketh small the drop of water  they pour down rain accord to the vapour thereof  36  28 which the cloud do drop and distil upon man abund  36  29 also can ani understand the spread of the cloud  or the nois of his tabernacl  36  30 behold  he spreadeth his light upon it  and covereth the bottom of the sea  36  31 for by them judgeth he the peopl  he giveth meat in abund  36  32 with cloud he covereth the light  and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt  36  33 the nois thereof sheweth concern it  the cattl also concern the vapour  37  1 at this also my heart trembleth  and is move out of his place  37  2 hear attent the nois of his voic  and the sound that goeth out of his mouth  37  3 he directeth it under the whole heaven  and his lightn unto the end of the earth  37  4 after it a voic roareth  he thundereth with the voic of his excel  and he will not stay them when his voic is heard  37  5 god thundereth marvel with his voic  great thing doeth he  which we cannot comprehend  37  6 for he saith to the snow  be thou on the earth  likewis to the small rain  and to the great rain of his strength  37  7 he sealeth up the hand of everi man  that all men may know his work  37  8 then the beast go into den  and remain in their place  37  9 out of the south cometh the whirlwind  and cold out of the north  37  10 by the breath of god frost is given  and the breadth of the water is straiten  37  11 also by water he wearieth the thick cloud  he scattereth his bright cloud  37  12 and it is turn round about by his counsel  that they may do whatsoev he commandeth

answer the lord  and said  42  2 i know that thou canst do everi thing  and that no thought can be withholden from thee  42  3 who is he that hideth counsel without knowledg  therefor have i utter that i understood not  thing too wonder for me  which i knew not  42  4 hear  i beseech thee  and i will speak  i will demand of thee  and declar thou unto me  42  5 i have heard of thee by the hear of the ear  but now mine eye seeth thee  42  6 wherefor i abhor myself  and repent in dust and ash  42  7 and it was so  that after the lord had spoken these word unto job  the lord said to eliphaz the temanit  my wrath is kindl against thee  and against thi two friend  for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right  as my servant job hath  42  8 therefor take unto you now seven bullock and seven ram  and go to my servant job  and offer up for yourselv a burnt offer  and my servant job shall pray for you  for him will i accept  lest i deal with you after your folli  in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right  like my servant job  42  9 so eliphaz the temanit and bildad the shuhit and zophar the naamathit went  and did accord as the lord command them  the lord also accept job  42  10 and the lord turn the captiv of job  when he pray for his friend  also the lord gave job twice as much as he had befor  42  11 then came there unto him all his brethren  and all his

also gave him a piec of money  and everi one an earring of gold  42  12 so the lord bless the latter end of job more than his begin  for he had fourteen thousand sheep  and six thousand camel  and a

wind driveth away  1  5 therefor the ungod shall not stand in the judgment  nor sinner in the congreg of the righteous  1  6 for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous  but the way of the ungod shall perish  2  1 whi do the heathen rage  and the peopl imagin a vain thing  2  2 the king of the earth set themselv  and the ruler take counsel togeth  against the lord  and against his anoint  say  2  3 let us break their band asund  and cast away their cord from us  2  4 he that sitteth in the heaven shall laugh  the lord shall have them in deris  2  5 then shall he speak unto them in his

are not known  77  20 thou leddest thi peopl like a flock by the hand of mose and aaron  78  1 give ear  o my peopl  to my law  inclin your ear to the word of my mouth  78  2 i will open my mouth in a parabl  i will utter dark say of old  78  3 which we have heard and known  and our father have told us  78  4 we will not hide them from their children  shew to the generat to come the prais of the lord  and his strength  and his wonder work that he hath done  78  5 for he establish a testimoni in jacob  and appoint a law in israel  which he command our father  that they should make them known to their children  78  6 that the generat to come might know them  even the children which should be born  who should aris and declar them to their children  78  7 that they might set their hope in god  and not forget the work of god  but keep his command  78  8 and might not be as their father  a stubborn and rebelli generat  a generat that set not their heart aright  and whose spirit was not stedfast with god  78  9 the children of ephraim  be arm  and carri bow  turn back in the day of battl  78  10 they kept not the coven of god  and refus to walk in his law  78  11 and forgat his work  and his wonder that he had shew them  78  12 marvel thing did he in the sight of their father  in the land of egypt  in the field of zoan  78  13 he divid the sea  and caus them to pass through  and he made the water to stand as an heap  78  14 in the daytim also he led them with a cloud  and all the night with a light of fire  78  15 he clave the rock in the wilder  and gave them drink as out of the great depth  78  16 he brought stream also out of the rock  and caus water to run down like river  78  17 and they sin yet more against him by provok the most high in the wilder  78  18 and they tempt god in their heart by ask meat for their lust  78  19 yea  they spake against god  they said  can god furnish a tabl in the wilder  78  20 behold  he smote the rock  that the water gush out  and the stream overflow  can he give bread also  can he provid flesh for his peopl  78  21 therefor the lord heard this  and was wroth  so a fire was kindl against jacob  and anger also came up against israel  78  22 becaus they believ not in god  and trust not in his salvat  78  23 though he had command the cloud from abov  and open the door of heaven  78  24 and had rain down manna upon them to eat  and had given them of the corn of heaven  78  25 man did eat angel  food  he sent them meat to the full  78  26 he caus an east wind to blow in the heaven  and by his power he brought in the south wind  78  27 he rain flesh also upon them as dust  and feather fowl like as the sand of the sea  78  28 and he let it fall in the midst of their camp  round about their habit  78  29 so they did eat  and were well fill  for he gave them their own desir  78  30 they were not estrang from their lust  but while their meat was yet in their mouth  78  31 the wrath of god came upon them  and slew the fattest of them  and smote down the chosen men of israel  78  32 for all this they sin still  and believ not for his wondrous work  78  33 therefor their day did he consum in vaniti  and their year in troubl  78  34 when he slew them  then they sought him  and they return and enquir earli after god  78  35 and they rememb that god was their rock  and the high god their redeem  78  36 nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth  and they lie unto him with their tongu  78  37 for their heart was not right with him  neither were they stedfast in his coven  78  38 but he  be full of compass  forgav their iniqu  and destroy them not  yea  mani a time turn he his anger away  and did not stir up all his wrath  78  39 for he rememb that they were but flesh  a wind that passeth away  and cometh not again  78  40 how oft did they provok him in the wilder  and griev him in the desert  78  41 yea  they turn back and tempt god  and limit the holi one of israel  78  42 they rememb not his hand  nor the day when he deliv them from the enemi  78  43 how he had wrought his sign in egypt  and his wonder in the field of zoan  78  44 and had turn their river into blood  and their flood  that they could not drink  78  45 he sent diver sort of fli among them  which devour them  and frog  which destroy them  78  46 he gave also their increas unto the caterpil  and their labour unto the locust  78  47 he destroy their vine with hail  and their sycomor tree with frost  78  48 he gave up their cattl also to the hail  and their flock to hot thunderbolt  78  49 he cast upon them the fierc of his anger  wrath  and indign  and troubl  by send evil angel among them  78  50 he made a way to his anger  he spare not their soul from death  but gave their life over to the pestil  78  51 and smote all the firstborn in egypt  the chief of their strength in the tabernacl of ham  78  52 but made his own peopl to go forth like sheep  and guid them in the wilder like a flock  78  53 and he led them on safe  so that they fear not  but the sea overwhelm their enemi  78  54 and he brought them to the border of his sanctuari  even to this mountain  which his right hand had purchas  78  55 he cast out the heathen also befor them  and divid them an inherit by line  and made the tribe of israel to dwell in their tent  78  56 yet they tempt and provok the most high god  and kept not his testimoni  78  57 but turn back  and dealt unfaith like their father  they were turn asid like a deceit bow  78  58 for they provok him to anger with their high place  and move him to jealousi with their graven imag  78  59 when god heard this  he was wroth  and great abhor israel  78  60 so that he forsook the tabernacl of shiloh  the tent which he place among men  78  61 and deliv his strength into captiv  and his glori into the enemi  s hand  78  62 he gave his peopl over also unto the sword  and was wroth with his inherit  78  63 the fire consum their young men  and their maiden were not given to marriag  78  64 their priest fell by the sword  and their widow made no lament  78  65 then the lord awak as one out of sleep  and like a mighti man that shouteth by reason of wine  78  66 and he smote his enemi in the hinder part  he put them to a perpetu reproach  78  67 moreov he refus the tabernacl of joseph  and chose not the tribe of ephraim  78  68 but chose the tribe of judah  the mount zion which he love  78  69 and he built his sanctuari like high palac  like the earth which he hath establish for ever  78  70 he chose david also his servant  and took him from the sheepfold  78  71 from follow the ewe great with young he brought him to feed jacob his peopl  and israel his inherit  78  72 so he fed them accord to the integr of his heart  and guid them by the skil of his hand  79  1 o god  the heathen are come into thine inherit  thi holi templ have they defil  they have laid jerusalem on heap  79  2 the dead bodi of thi servant have they given to be meat unto the fowl of the heaven  the flesh of thi saint unto the beast of the earth  79  3 their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem  and there was none to buri them  79  4 we are becom a reproach to our neighbour  a scorn and deris to them that are round about us  79  5 how long  lord  wilt thou be angri for ever  shall thi jealousi burn like fire  79  6 pour out thi wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee  and upon the kingdom that have not call upon thi name  79  7 for they have devour jacob  and laid wast his dwell place  79  8 o rememb not against us

106  7 our father understood not thi wonder in egypt  they rememb not the multitud of thi merci  but provok him at the sea  even at the red sea  106  8 nevertheless he save them for his name  s sake  that he might make his mighti power to be known  106  9 he rebuk the red sea also  and it was dri up  so he led them through the depth  as through the wilder  106  10 and he save them from the hand of him that hate them  and redeem them from the hand of the enemi  106  11 and the water cover their enemi  there was not one of them left  106  12 then believ they his word  they sang his prais  106  13 they soon forgat his work  they wait not for his counsel  106  14 but lust exceed in the wilder  and tempt god in the desert  106  15 and he gave them their request  but sent lean into their soul  106  16 they envi mose also in the camp  and aaron the saint of the lord  106  17 the earth open and swallow up dathan and cover the compani of abiram  106  18 and a fire was kindl in their compani  the

the bosom of a stranger  5  21 for the way of man are befor the eye of the lord  and he pondereth all his go  5  22 his own iniqu shall take the wick himself  and he shall be holden with the cord of his sin  5  23 he shall die without instruct  and in the great of his folli he shall go astray  6  1 my son  if thou be sureti for thi friend  if thou hast stricken thi hand with a stranger  6  2 thou art snare with the word of thi mouth  thou art taken with the word of thi mouth  6  3 do this now  my son  and deliv thyself  when thou art come into the hand of thi friend  go  humbl thyself  and make sure thi friend  6  4 give not sleep to thine eye  nor slumber to thine eyelid  6  5 deliv thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter  and as a bird from the hand of the fowler  6  6 go to the ant  thou sluggard  consid her way  and be wise  6  7 which have no guid  overs  or ruler  6  8 provideth her meat in the summer  and gathereth her food in the harvest  6  9 how long wilt thou sleep  o sluggard  when wilt thou aris out of thi sleep  6  10 yet a littl sleep  a littl slumber  a littl fold of the hand to sleep  6  11 so shall thi poverti come as one that travelleth  and thi want as an arm man  6  12 a naughti person  a wick man  walketh with a froward mouth  6  13 he winketh with his eye  he speaketh with his feet  he teacheth with his finger  6  14 froward is in his heart  he deviseth mischief continu  he soweth discord  6  15 therefor shall his calam come sudden  sudden shall he be broken without remedi  6  16 these six thing doth the lord hate  yea  seven are an abomin unto him  6  17 a proud look  a lie tongu  and hand that shed innoc blood  6  18 an heart that deviseth wick imagin  feet that be swift in run to mischief  6  19 a fals wit that speaketh lie  and he that soweth discord among brethren  6  20 my son  keep thi father  s command  and forsak not the law of thi mother  6  21 bind them continu upon thine heart  and tie them about thi neck  6  22 when thou goest  it shall lead thee  when thou sleepest  it shall keep thee  and when thou awakest  it shall talk with thee  6  23 for the command is a lamp  and the law is light  and reproof of instruct are the way of life  6  24 to keep thee from the evil woman  from the flatteri of the tongu of a strang woman  6  25 lust not after her beauti in thine heart  neither let her take thee with her eyelid  6  26 for by mean of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piec of bread  and the adultress will hunt for the precious life  6  27 can a man take fire in his bosom  and his cloth not be burn  6  28 can one go upon hot coal  and his feet not be burn  6  29 so he that goeth in to his neighbour  s wife  whosoev toucheth her shall not be innoc  6  30 men do not despis a thief  if he steal to satisfi his soul when he is hungri  6  31 but if he be found  he shall restor sevenfold  he shall give all the substanc of his hous  6  32 but whoso committeth adulteri with a woman lacketh understand  he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul  6  33 a wound and dishonour shall he get  and his reproach shall not be wipe away  6  34 for jealousi is the rage of a man  therefor he will not spare in the day of vengeanc  6  35 he will not regard ani ransom  neither will he rest content  though thou givest mani gift  7  1 my son  keep my word  and lay up my command with thee  7  2 keep my command  and live

to the slaughter  or as a fool to the correct of the stock  7  23 till a dart strike through his liver  as a bird hasteth to the snare  and knoweth not that it is for his life  7  24 hearken unto me now therefor  o ye children  and attend to the word of my mouth  7  25 let not thine heart declin to her way  go not astray in her path  7  26 for she hath cast down mani wound  yea  mani strong men have been slain by her  7  27 her hous is the way to hell  go down to the chamber of death  8  1 doth not wisdom cri  and understand put forth her voic  8  2 she standeth in the top of high place  by

knoweth not that the dead are there  and that her guest are in the depth of hell  10  1 the proverb of solomon  a wise son maketh a glad father  but a foolish son is the heavi of his mother  10  2 treasur of wicked profit noth  but righteous delivereth from death  10  3 the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish  but he casteth away the substanc of the wick  10  4 he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand  but the hand of the dilig maketh rich  10  5 he that gathereth in summer is a wise son  but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame  10  6 bless are upon the head of the just  but violenc covereth the mouth of the wick  10  7 the memori of the just is bless  but the name of the wick shall rot  10  8 the wise in heart will receiv command  but a

11 the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life  but violenc covereth the mouth of the wick  10  12 hatr stirreth up strife  but love covereth all sin  10  13 in the lip of him that hath understand wisdom is found  but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understand  10  14 wise men lay up knowledg  but the mouth of the foolish is near destruct  10  15 the rich man  s wealth is his strong citi  the destruct of the poor is their poverti  10  16 the labour of the righteous tendeth to life  the fruit of the wick to sin  10  17 he is in the way of life that keepeth instruct  but he that refuseth reproof erreth  10  18 he that hideth hatr with lie lip  and he that uttereth a slander  is a fool  10  19 in the multitud of word there wanteth not sin  but he that refraineth his lip is wise  10  20 the tongu of the just is as choic silver  the heart of the wick is littl worth  10  21 the lip of the righteous feed mani  but fool die for want of wisdom  10  22 the bless of the lord  it maketh rich  and he addeth no sorrow with it  10  23 it is as sport to a fool to do mischief  but a man of understand hath wisdom  10  24 the fear of the wick  it shall come upon him  but the desir of the righteous shall be grant  10  25 as the whirlwind passeth  so is the wick no more  but the righteous is an everlast foundat  10  26 as vinegar to the teeth  and as smoke to the eye  so is the sluggard to them that send him  10  27 the fear of the lord prolongeth day  but the year of the wick shall be shorten  10  28 the hope of the righteous shall be glad  but the expect of the wick shall perish  10  29 the way of the lord is strength to the upright  but destruct shall be to the worker of iniqu  10  30 the righteous shall never be remov  but the wick shall not inhabit the earth  10  31 the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom  but the froward tongu shall be cut out  10  32 the lip of the righteous know what is accept  but the mouth of the wick speaketh froward  11  1 a fals balanc is abomin to the lord  but a just weight is his delight  11  2 when pride cometh  then cometh shame  but with the lowli is wisdom  11  3 the integr of the upright shall guid them  but the pervers of transgressor shall destroy them  11  4 rich profit not in the day of wrath  but righteous delivereth from death  11  5 the righteous of the perfect shall direct his way  but the wick shall fall by his own wicked  11  6 the righteous of the upright shall deliv them  but transgressor shall be taken in their own naughti  11  7 when a wick man dieth  his expect shall perish  and the hope of unjust men perisheth  11  8 the righteous is deliv out of troubl  and the wick cometh in his stead  11  9 an hypocrit with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour  but through knowledg shall the just be deliv  11  10 when it goeth well with the righteous  the citi rejoiceth  and when the wick perish  there is shout  11  11 by the bless of the upright the citi is exalt  but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wick  11  12 he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour  but a man of understand holdeth his peac  11  13 a talebear revealeth secret  but he that is of a faith spirit concealeth the matter  11  14 where no counsel is  the peopl fall  but in the multitud of counsellor there is safeti  11  15 he that is sureti for a stranger shall smart for it  and he that hateth suretiship is sure  11  16 a gracious woman retaineth honour  and strong men retain rich  11  17 the merci man doeth good to his own soul  but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh  11  18 the wick worketh a deceit work  but to him that soweth righteous shall be a sure reward  11  19 as righteous tendeth to life  so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death  11  20 they that are of a froward heart are abomin to the lord  but such as are upright in their way are his delight  11  21 though hand join in hand  the wick shall not be unpunish  but the seed of the righteous shall be deliv  11  22 as a jewel of gold in a swine  s snout  so is a fair woman which is without discret  11  23 the desir of the righteous is onli good  but the expect of the wick is wrath  11  24 there is that scattereth  and yet increaseth  and there is that withholdeth more than is meet  but it tendeth to poverti  11  25 the liber soul shall be made fat  and he that watereth shall be water also himself  11  26 he that withholdeth corn  the peopl shall curs him  but bless shall be upon the head of him that selleth it  11  27 he that dilig seeketh good procureth favour  but he that seeketh mischief  it shall come unto him  11  28 he that trusteth in his rich shall fall  but the righteous shall flourish as a branch  11  29 he that troubleth his own hous shall inherit the wind  and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart  11  30 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life  and he that winneth soul is wise  11  31 behold  the righteous shall be recompens in the earth  much more the wick and the sinner  12  1 whoso loveth instruct loveth knowledg  but he that hateth reproof is brutish  12  2 a good man obtaineth favour of the lord  but a man of wick devic will he condemn  12  3 a man shall not be establish by wicked  but the root of the righteous shall not be move  12  4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband  but she that maketh asham is as rotten in his bone  12  5 the thought of the righteous are right  but the counsel of the wick are deceit  12  6 the word of the wick are to lie in wait for blood  but the mouth of the upright shall deliv them  12  7 the wick are overthrown  and are not  but the hous of the righteous shall stand  12  8 a man shall be commend accord to his wisdom  but he that is of a pervers heart shall be despis  12  9 he that is despis  and hath a servant  is better than he that honoureth himself  and lacketh bread  12  10 a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast  but the tender merci of the wick are cruel  12  11 he that tilleth his land shall be satisfi with bread  but he that followeth vain person is void of understand  12  12 the wick desireth the net of evil men  but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit  12  13 the wick is snare by the transgress of his lip  but the just shall come out of troubl  12  14 a man shall be satisfi with good by the fruit of his mouth  and the recomp of a man  s hand shall be render unto him  12  15 the way of a fool is right in his own eye  but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise  12  16 a fool  s wrath is present known  but a prudent man covereth shame  12  17 he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteous  but a fals wit deceit  12  18 there is that speaketh like the pierc of a sword  but the tongu of the wise is health  12  19 the lip of truth shall be establish for ever  but a lie tongu is but for a moment  12  20 deceit is in the heart of them that imagin evil  but to the counsellor of peac is joy  12  21 there shall no evil happen to the just  but the wick shall be fill with mischief  12  22 lie lip are abomin to the lord  but they that deal truli are his delight  12  23 a prudent man concealeth knowledg  but the heart of fool proclaimeth foolish  12  24 the hand of the dilig shall bear rule  but the sloth shall be under tribut  12  25 heavi in the heart of man maketh it stoop  but a good word maketh it glad  12  26 the righteous is more excel than his neighbour  but the way of the wick seduceth them  12  27 the sloth man roasteth not that which he took in hunt  but the substanc of a dilig man is precious  12  28 in the way of righteous is life  and in the pathway thereof there is no death  13  1 a wise son heareth his father  s instruct  but a scorner heareth not rebuk  13  2 a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth  but the soul of the transgressor shall eat violenc  13  3 he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life  but he that openeth wide his lip shall have destruct  13  4 the soul of the sluggard desireth  and hath noth  but

caus seemeth just  but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him  18  18 the lot causeth content to ceas  and parteth between the mighti  18  19 a brother offend is harder to be won than a strong citi  and their content are like the bar of a castl  18  20 a man  s belli shall be satisfi with the fruit of his mouth  and with the increas of his lip shall he be fill  18  21 death and life are in the power of the tongu  and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof  18  22 whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing  and obtaineth favour of the lord  18  23 the poor useth intreati  but the rich answereth rough  18  24 a man that hath friend must shew himself friend  and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother  19  1 better is the poor that walketh in his integr  than he that is pervers in his lip  and is a fool  19  2 also  that the soul be without knowledg  it is not good  and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth  19  3 the foolish of man perverteth his way  and his heart fretteth against the lord  19  4 wealth maketh mani friend  but the poor is separ from his neighbour  19  5 a fals wit shall not be unpunish  and he that speaketh lie shall not escap  19  6 mani will

perish  19  10 delight is not seem for a fool  much less for a servant to have rule over princ  19  11 the discret of a man deferreth his anger  and it is his glori to pass over a transgress  19  12 the king  s wrath is as the roar of a lion  but his favour is as dew upon the grass  19  13 a foolish son is the calam of his father  and the content of a wife are a continu drop  19  14 hous and rich

liar  19  23 the fear of the lord tendeth to life  and he that hath it shall abid satisfi  he shall not be visit with evil  19  24 a sloth man hideth his hand in his bosom  and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again  19  25 smite a scorner  and the simpl will bewar  and reprov one that hath understand  and he will understand knowledg  19  26 he that wasteth his father  and chaseth away his mother  is a son that causeth shame  and bringeth reproach  19  27 ceas  my son  to hear the instruct that causeth to err from the word of knowledg  19  28 an ungod wit scorneth judgment  and the

rich certain make themselv wing  they fli away as an eagl toward heaven  23  6 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye  neither desir thou his dainti meat  23  7 for as he thinketh in his heart  so is he  eat and drink  saith he to thee  but his heart is not with thee  23  8 the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up  and lose thi sweet word  23  9 speak not in the ear of a fool  for he will despis the wisdom of thi word  23  10 remov not the old landmark  and enter not into the field of the fatherless  23  11 for their redeem is mighti  he shall plead their caus with

me thine heart  and let thine eye observ my way  23  27 for a whore is a deep ditch  and a strang woman is a narrow pit  23  28 she also lieth in wait as for a prey  and increaseth the transgressor among men  23  29 who hath woe  who hath sorrow  who hath content  who hath babbl  who hath wound without caus  who hath red of eye  23  30 they that tarri long at the wine  they that go to seek mix wine  23  31 look not thou upon the wine when it is red  when it giveth his colour in the cup  when it moveth itself aright  23  32 at the last it biteth like a serpent  and stingeth like an adder  23  33 thine eye shall behold strang women  and thine heart shall utter pervers thing  23  34 yea  thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea  or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast  23  35 they have stricken me  shalt thou say  and i was not sick  they have beaten me  and i felt it not  when shall i awak  i will seek it yet again  24  1 be not thou envious against evil men  neither desir to be with them  24  2 for their heart studieth destruct  and their lip talk of mischief  24  3 through wisdom is an hous build  and by understand it is establish  24  4 and by knowledg shall the chamber be fill with all precious and pleasant rich  24  5 a wise man is strong  yea  a man of knowledg increaseth strength  24  6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thi war  and in multitud of counsellor there is safeti  24  7 wisdom is too high for a fool  he openeth not his mouth in the gate  24  8 he that deviseth to do evil shall be call a mischiev person  24  9 the thought of foolish is sin  and the scorner is an abomin to men  24  10 if thou faint in the day of advers  thi strength is small  24  11 if thou forbear to deliv them that are drawn unto death  and those that are readi to be slain  24  12 if thou sayest  behold  we knew it not  doth not he that pondereth the heart consid it  and he that keepeth thi soul  doth not he know it  and shall not he render to everi man accord to his work  24  13 my son  eat thou honey  becaus it is good  and the honeycomb  which is sweet to thi tast  24  14 so shall the knowledg of wisdom be unto thi soul  when thou hast found it  then there shall be a reward  and thi expect shall not be cut off  24  15 lay not wait  o wick man  against the dwell of the righteous  spoil not his rest place  24  16 for a just man falleth seven time  and riseth up again  but the wick shall fall into mischief  24  17 rejoic not when thine enemi falleth  and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth  24  18 lest the lord see it  and it displeas him  and he turn away his wrath from him  24  19 fret not thyself becaus of evil men  neither be thou envious at the wick  24  20 for there shall be no reward to the evil man  the candl of the wick shall be put out  24  21 my son  fear thou the lord and the king  and meddl not with them that are given to chang  24  22 for their calam shall rise sudden  and who knoweth the ruin of them both  24  23 these thing also belong to the wise  it is not good to have respect of person in judgment  24  24 he that saith unto the wick  thou are righteous  him shall the peopl curs  nation shall abhor him  24  25 but to them that rebuk him shall be delight  and a good bless shall come upon them  24  26 everi man shall kiss his lip that giveth a right answer  24  27 prepar thi work without  and make it fit for thyself in the field  and afterward build thine hous  24  28 be not a wit against thi neighbour without caus  and deceiv not with thi lip  24  29 say not  i will do so to him as he hath done to me  i will render to the man accord to his work  24  30 i went by the field of the sloth  and by the vineyard of the man void of understand  24  31 and  lo  it was all grown over with thorn  and nettl had cover the face thereof  and the stone wall thereof was broken down  24  32 then i saw  and consid it well  i look upon it  and receiv instruct  24  33 yet a littl sleep  a littl slumber  a littl fold of the hand to sleep  24  34 so shall thi poverti come as one that travelleth  and thi want as an arm man  25  1 these are also proverb of solomon  which the men of hezekiah king of judah copi out  25  2 it is the glori of god to conceal a thing  but the honour of king is to search out a matter  25  3 the heaven for height  and the earth for depth  and the heart of king is unsearch  25  4 take away the dross from the silver  and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer  25  5 take away the wick from befor the king  and his throne shall be establish in righteous  25  6 put not forth thyself in the presenc of the king  and stand not in the place of great men  25  7 for better it is that it be said unto thee  come up hither  than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presenc of the princ whom thine eye have seen  25  8 go not forth hastili to strive  lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof  when thi neighbour hath put thee to shame  25  9 debat thi caus with thi neighbour himself  and discov not a secret to anoth  25  10 lest he that heareth it put thee to shame  and thine infami turn not away  25  11 a word fit spoken is like appl of gold in pictur of silver  25  12 as an earring of gold  and an ornament of fine gold  so is a wise reprov upon an obedi ear  25  13 as the cold of snow in the time of harvest  so is a faith messeng to them that send him  for he refresheth the soul of his master  25  14 whoso boasteth himself of a fals gift is like cloud and wind without rain  25  15 by long forbear is a princ persuad  and a soft tongu breaketh the bone  25  16 hast thou found honey  eat so much as is suffici for thee  lest thou be fill therewith  and vomit it  25  17 withdraw thi foot from thi neighbour  s hous  lest he be weari of thee  and so hate thee  25  18 a man that beareth fals wit against his neighbour is a maul  and a sword  and a sharp arrow  25  19 confid in an unfaith man in time of troubl is like a broken tooth  and a foot out of joint  25  20 as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather  and as vinegar upon nitr  so is he that singeth song to an heavi heart  25  21 if thine enemi be hungri  give him bread to eat  and if he be thirsti  give him water to drink  25  22 for thou shalt heap coal of fire upon his head  and the lord shall reward thee  25  23 the north wind driveth away rain  so doth an angri counten a backbit tongu  25  24 it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop  than with a brawl woman and in a wide hous  25  25 as cold water to a thirsti soul  so is good news from a far countri  25  26 a righteous man fall down befor the wick is as a troubl fountain  and a corrupt spring  25  27 it is not good to eat much honey  so for men to search their own glori is not glori  25  28 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a citi that is broken down  and without wall  26  1 as snow in summer  and as rain in harvest  so honour is not seem for a fool  26  2 as the bird by wander  as the swallow by fli  so the curs causeless shall not come  26  3 a whip for the hors  a bridl for the ass  and a rod for the fool  s back  26  4 answer not a fool accord to his folli  lest thou also be like unto him  26  5 answer a fool accord to his folli  lest he be wise in his own conceit  26  6 he that sendeth a messag by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet  and drinketh damag  26  7 the leg of the lame are not equal  so is a parabl in the mouth of fool  26  8 as he that bindeth a stone in a sling  so is he that giveth honour to a fool  26  9 as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard  so is a parabl in the mouth of fool  26  10 the great god that form all thing both rewardeth the fool  and rewardeth transgressor  26  11 as a dog returneth to his vomit  so a fool returneth to his folli  26  12 seest thou a man wise in his own conceit  there is more hope of a fool than of him  26  13 the sloth man saith  there is a lion in the way  a lion is in the street  26  14 as the door turneth upon his hing  so doth the sloth upon his bed  26  15 the sloth hideth his hand in his bosom  it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth  26  16 the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason  26  17 he that passeth by  and meddleth with strife belong not to him  is like one that taketh a dog by the ear  26  18 as a mad man who casteth firebrand  arrow  and death  26  19 so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour  and saith  am not i in sport  26  20 where no wood is  there the fire goeth out  so where there is no talebear  the strife ceaseth  26  21 as coal are to burn coal  and wood to fire  so is a contenti man to kindl strife  26  22 the word of a talebear are as wound  and they go down into the innermost part of the belli  26  23 burn lip and a wick heart are like a potsherd cover with silver dross  26  24 he that hateth dissembleth with his lip  and layeth up deceit within him  26  25 when he speaketh fair  believ him not  for there are seven abomin in his heart  26  26 whose hatr is cover by deceit  his wicked shall be shew befor the whole congreg  26  27 whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein  and he that rolleth a stone  it will return upon him  26  28 a lie tongu hateth those that are afflict by it  and a flatter mouth worketh ruin  27  1 boast not thyself of to morrow  for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth  27  2 let anoth man prais thee  and not thine own mouth  a stranger  and not thine own lip  27  3 a stone is heavi  and the sand weighti  but a fool  s wrath is heavier than them both  27  4 wrath is cruel  and anger is outrag  but who is abl to stand befor envi  27  5 open rebuk is better than secret love  27  6 faith are the wound of a friend  but the kiss of an enemi are deceit  27  7 the full soul loatheth an honeycomb  but to the hungri soul everi bitter thing is sweet  27  8 as a bird that wandereth from her nest  so is a man that wandereth from his place  27  9 ointment and perfum rejoic the heart  so doth the sweet of a man  s friend by hearti counsel  27  10 thine own friend  and thi father  s friend  forsak not  neither go into thi brother  s hous in the day of thi calam  for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off  27  11 my son  be wise  and make my heart glad  that i may answer him that reproacheth me  27  12 a prudent man foreseeth the evil  and hideth himself  but the simpl pass on  and are punish  27  13 take his garment that is sureti for a stranger  and take a pledg of him for a strang woman  27  14 he that blesseth his friend with a loud voic  rise earli in the morn  it shall be count a curs to him  27  15 a continu drop in a veri raini day and a contenti woman are alik  27  16 whosoev hideth her hideth the wind  and the ointment of his right hand  which bewrayeth itself  27  17 iron sharpeneth iron  so a man sharpeneth the counten of his friend  27  18 whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof  so he that waiteth on his master shall be honour  27  19 as in water face answereth to face  so the heart of man to man  27  20 hell and destruct are never full  so the eye of man are never satisfi  27  21 as the fine pot for silver  and the furnac for gold  so is a man to his prais  27  22 though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestl  yet will not his foolish depart from him  27  23 be thou dilig to know the state of thi flock  and look well to thi herd  27  24 for rich are not for ever  and doth the crown endur to everi generat  27  25 the hay appeareth  and the tender grass sheweth itself  and herb of the mountain are gather  27  26 the lamb are for thi cloth  and the goat are the price of the field  27  27 and thou shalt have goat  milk enough for thi food  for the food of thi household  and for the mainten for thi maiden  28  1 the wick flee when no man pursueth  but the righteous are bold as a lion  28  2 for the transgress of a land mani are the princ thereof  but by a man of understand and knowledg the state thereof shall be prolong  28  3 a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweep rain which leaveth no food  28  4 they that forsak the law prais the wick  but such as keep the law contend with them  28  5 evil men understand not judgment  but they that seek the lord understand all thing  28  6 better is the poor that walketh in his upright  than he that is pervers in his way  though he be rich  28  7 whoso keepeth the law is a wise son  but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father  28  8 he that by usuri and unjust gain increaseth his substanc  he shall gather it for him that will piti the poor  28  9 he that turneth away his ear from hear the law  even his prayer shall be abomin  28  10 whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way  he shall fall himself into his own pit  but the upright shall have good thing in possess  28  11 the rich man is wise in his own conceit  but the poor that hath understand searcheth him out  28  12 when righteous men do rejoic  there is great glori  but when the wick rise  a man is hidden  28  13 he that covereth his sin shall not prosper  but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have merci  28  14 happi is the man that feareth alway  but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief  28  15 as a roar lion  and a rang bear  so is a wick ruler over the poor peopl  28  16 the princ that wanteth understand is also a great oppressor  but he that hateth covet shall prolong his day  28  17 a man that doeth violenc to the blood of ani person shall flee to the pit  let no man stay him  28  18 whoso walketh upright shall be save  but he that is pervers in his way shall fall at onc  28  19 he that tilleth his land shall have plenti of bread  but he that followeth after vain person shall have poverti enough  28  20 a faith man shall abound with bless  but he that maketh hast to be rich shall not be innoc  28  21 to have respect of person is not good  for for a piec of bread that man will transgress  28  22 he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye  and considereth not that poverti shall come upon him  28  23 he that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongu  28  24 whoso robbeth his father or his mother  and saith  it is no transgress  the same is the companion of a destroy  28  25 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife  but he that putteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat  28  26 he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool  but whoso walketh wise  he shall be deliv  28  27 he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack  but he that hideth his eye shall have mani a curs  28  28 when the wick rise  men hide themselv  but when they perish  the righteous increas  29  1 he  that be often reprov hardeneth his neck  shall sudden be destroy  and that without remedi  29  2 when the righteous are in author  the peopl rejoic  but when the wick beareth rule  the peopl mourn  29  3 whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father  but he that keepeth compani with harlot spendeth his substanc  29  4 the king by judgment establisheth the land  but he that receiveth gift overthroweth it  29  5 a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet  29  6 in the transgress of an evil man there is a snare  but the righteous doth sing and rejoic  29  7 the righteous considereth the caus of the poor  but the wick regardeth not to know it  29  8 scorn men bring a citi into a snare  but wise men turn away wrath  29  9 if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man  whether he rage or laugh  there is no rest  29  10 the bloodthirsti hate the upright  but the just seek his soul  29  11 a fool uttereth all his mind  but a wise man keepeth it in till afterward  29  12 if a ruler hearken to lie  all his servant are wick  29  13 the poor and the deceit man meet togeth  the lord lighteneth both their eye  29  14 the king that faith judgeth the poor  his throne shall be establish for ever  29  15 the rod and reproof give wisdom  but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame  29  16 when the wick are multipli  transgress increaseth  but the righteous shall see their fall  29  17 correct thi son  and he shall give thee rest  yea  he shall give delight unto thi soul  29  18 where there is no vision  the peopl perish  but he that keepeth the law  happi is he  29  19 a servant will not be correct by word  for though he understand he will not answer  29  20 seest thou a man that is hasti in his word  there is more hope of a fool than of him  29  21 he that delic bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him becom his son at the length  29  22 an angri man stirreth up strife  and a furious man aboundeth in transgress  29  23 a man  s pride shall bring him low  but honour shall uphold the humbl in spirit  29  24 whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul  he heareth curs  and bewrayeth it not  29  25 the fear of man bringeth a snare  but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe  29  26 mani seek the ruler  s favour  but everi man  s judgment cometh from the lord  29  27 an unjust man is an abomin to the just  and he that is upright in the way is abomin to the wick  30  1 the word of agur the son of jakeh  even the propheci  the man spake unto ithiel  even unto

26 she openeth her mouth with wisdom  and in her tongu is the law of kind  31  27 she looketh well to the way of her household  and eateth not the bread of idl  31  28 her children aris up  and call her bless  her husband also  and he praiseth her  31  29 mani daughter have done virtuous  but thou excellest them all  31  30 favour is deceit  and beauti is vain  but a woman that feareth the lord  she shall be prais  31  31 give her of the fruit of her hand  and let her own work prais her in the gate  ecclesiast or the preacher 1  1 the word of the preacher  the son of david  king in jerusalem  1  2 vaniti of vaniti  saith the preacher  vaniti of vaniti  all is vaniti  1  3 what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun  1  4 one generat passeth away  and anoth generat cometh  but the earth abideth for ever  1  5 the sun also ariseth  and the sun goeth down  and hasteth to his place where he aros  1  6 the wind goeth toward the south  and turneth about unto the north  it whirleth about continu  and the wind returneth again accord to his circuit  1  7 all the river run into the sea  yet the sea is not full  unto the place from whenc the river come  thither they return again  1  8 all thing are full of labour  man cannot utter it  the eye is not satisfi with see  nor the ear fill with hear  1  9 the thing that hath been  it is that which shall be  and that which is done is that which shall be done  and there is no new thing under the sun  1  10 is there ani thing whereof it may be said  see  this is new  it hath been alreadi of old time  which was befor us  1  11 there is no remembr of former thing  neither shall there be ani remembr of thing that are to come with those that shall come after  1  12 i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem  1  13 and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern all thing that are done under heaven  this sore travail hath god given to the son of man to be exercis therewith  1  14 i have seen all the work that are done under the sun  and  behold  all is vaniti and vexat of spirit  1  15 that which is crook cannot be made straight  and that which is want cannot be number  1  16 i commune with mine own heart  say  lo  i am come to great estat  and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been befor me in jerusalem  yea  my heart had great experi of wisdom and knowledg  1  17 and i gave my heart to know wisdom  and to know mad and folli  i perceiv that this also is vexat of spirit  1  18 for in much wisdom is much grief  and he that increaseth knowledg increaseth sorrow  2  1 i said in mine heart  go to now  i will prove thee with mirth  therefor enjoy pleasur  and  behold  this also is vaniti  2  2 i said of laughter  it is mad  and of mirth  what doeth it  2  3 i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine  yet acquaint mine heart with wisdom  and to lay hold on folli  till i might see what was that good for the son of men  which they should do under the heaven all the day of their life  2  4 i made me great work  i build me hous  i plant me vineyard  2  5 i made me garden and orchard  and i plant tree in them of all kind of fruit  2  6 i made me pool of water  to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth tree  2  7 i got me servant and maiden  and had servant born in my hous  also i had great possess of great and small cattl abov all that were in jerusalem befor me  2  8 i gather me also silver and gold  and the peculiar treasur of king and of the provinc  i gat me men singer and women singer  and the delight of the son of men  as music instrument  and that of all sort  2  9 so i was great  and increas more than all that were befor me in jerusalem  also my wisdom remain with me  2  10 and whatsoev mine eye desir i kept not from them  i withheld not my heart from ani joy  for my heart rejoic in all my labour  and this was my portion of all my labour  2  11 then i look on all the work that my hand had wrought  and on the labour that i had labour to do  and  behold  all was vaniti and vexat of spirit  and there was no profit under the sun  2  12 and i turn myself to behold wisdom  and mad  and folli  for what can the man do that cometh after the king  even that which hath been alreadi done  2  13 then i saw that wisdom excelleth folli  as far as light excelleth dark  2  14 the wise man  s eye are in his head  but the fool walketh in dark  and i myself perceiv also that one event happeneth to them all  2  15 then said i in my heart  as it happeneth to the fool  so it happeneth even to me  and whi was i then more wise  then i said in my heart  that this also is vaniti  2  16 for there is no remembr of the wise more than of the fool for ever  see that which now is in the day to come shall all be forgotten  and how dieth the wise man  as the fool  2  17 therefor i hate life  becaus the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me  for all is vaniti and vexat of spirit  2  18 yea  i hate all my labour which i had taken under the sun  becaus i should leav it unto the man that shall be after me  2  19 and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool  yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have labour  and wherein i have shew myself wise under the sun  this is also vaniti  2  20 therefor i went about to caus my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun  2  21 for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom  and in knowledg  and in equiti  yet to a man that hath not labour therein shall he leav it for his portion  this also is vaniti and a great evil  2  22 for what hath man of all his labour  and of the vexat of his heart  wherein he hath labour under the sun  2  23 for all his day are sorrow  and his travail grief  yea  his heart taketh not rest in the night  this is also vaniti  2  24 there is noth better for a man  than that he should eat and drink  and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour  this also i saw  that it was from the hand of god  2  25 for who can eat  or who els can hasten hereunto  more than i  2  26 for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom  and knowledg  and joy  but to the sinner he giveth travail  to gather and to heap up  that he may give to him that is good befor god  this also is vaniti and vexat of spirit  3  1 to everi thing there is a season  and a time to everi purpos under the heaven  3  2 a time to be born  and a time to die  a time to plant  and a time to pluck up that which is plant  3  3 a time to kill  and a time to heal  a time to break down  and a time to build up  3  4 a time to weep  and a time to laugh  a time to mourn  and a time to danc  3  5 a time to cast away stone  and a time to gather stone togeth  a time to embrac  and a time to refrain from embrac  3  6 a time to get  and a time to lose  a time to keep  and a time to cast away  3  7 a time to rend  and a time to sew  a time to keep silenc  and a time to speak  3  8 a time to love  and a time to hate  a time of war  and a time of peac  3  9 what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth  3  10 i have seen the travail  which god hath given to the son of men to be exercis in it  3  11 he hath made everi thing beauti in his time  also he hath set the world in their heart  so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the begin to the end  3  12 i know that there is no good in them  but for a man to rejoic  and to do good in his life  3  13 and also that everi man should eat and drink  and enjoy the good of all his labour  it is the gift of god  3  14 i know that  whatsoev god doeth  it shall be for ever  noth can be put to it  nor ani thing taken from it  and god doeth it  that men should fear befor him  3  15 that which hath been is now  and that which is to be hath alreadi been  and god requireth that which is past  3  16 and moreov i saw under the sun the place of judgment  that wicked was there  and the place of righteous  that iniqu was there  3  17 i said in mine heart  god shall judg the righteous and the wick  for there is a time there for everi purpos and for everi work  3  18 i said in mine heart concern the estat of the son of men  that god might manifest them  and that they might see that they themselv are beast  3  19 for that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beast  even one thing befalleth them  as the one dieth  so dieth the other  yea  they have all one breath  so that a man hath no preemin abov a beast  for all is vaniti  3  20 all go unto one place  all are of the dust  and all turn to dust again  3  21 who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward  and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth  3  22 wherefor i perceiv that there is noth better  than that a man should rejoic in his own work  for that is his portion  for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him  4  1 so i return  and consid all the oppress that are done under the sun  and behold the tear of such as were oppress  and they had no comfort  and on the side of their oppressor there was power  but they had no comfort  4  2 wherefor i prais the dead which are alreadi dead more than the live which are yet aliv  4  3 yea  better is he than both they  which hath not yet been  who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun  4  4 again  i consid all travail  and everi right work  that for this a man is envi of his neighbour  this is also vaniti and vexat of spirit  4  5 the fool foldeth his hand togeth  and eateth his own flesh  4  6 better is an hand with quiet  than both the hand full with travail and vexat of spirit  4  7 then i return  and i saw vaniti under the sun  4  8 there is one alon  and there is not a second  yea  he hath neither child nor brother  yet is there no end of all his labour  neither is his eye satisfi with rich  neither saith he  for whom do i labour  and bereav my soul of good  this is also vaniti  yea  it is a sore travail  4  9 two are better than one  becaus they have a good reward for their labour  4  10 for if they fall  the one will lift up his fellow  but woe to him that is alon when he falleth  for he hath not anoth to help him up  4  11 again  if two lie togeth  then they have heat  but how can one be warm alon  4  12 and if one prevail against him  two shall withstand him  and a threefold cord is not quick broken  4  13 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king  who will no more be admonish  4  14 for out of prison he cometh to reign  wherea also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor  4  15 i consid all the live which walk under the sun  with the second child that shall stand up in his stead  4  16 there is no end of all the peopl  even of all that have been befor them  they also that come after shall not rejoic in him  sure this also is vaniti and vexat of spirit  5  1 keep thi foot when thou goest to the hous of god  and be more readi to hear  than to give the sacrific of fool  for they consid not that they do evil  5  2 be not rash with thi mouth  and let not thine heart be hasti to utter ani thing befor god  for god is in heaven  and thou upon earth  therefor let thi word be few  5  3 for a dream cometh through the multitud of busi  and a fool  s voic is known by multitud of word  5  4 when thou vowest a vow unto god  defer not to pay it  for he hath no pleasur in fool  pay that which thou hast vow  5  5 better is it that thou shouldest not vow  than that thou shouldest vow and not pay  5  6 suffer not thi mouth to caus thi flesh to sin  neither say thou befor the angel  that it was an error  wherefor should god be angri at thi voic  and destroy the work of thine hand  5  7 for in the multitud of dream and mani word there are also diver vaniti  but fear thou god  5  8 if thou seest the oppress of the poor  and violent pervert of judgment and justic in a provinc  marvel not at the matter  for he that is higher than the highest regardeth  and there be higher than they  5  9 moreov the profit of the earth is for all  the king himself is serv by the field  5  10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfi with silver  nor he that loveth abund with increas  this is also vaniti  5  11 when good increas  they are increas that eat them  and what good is there to the owner thereof  save the behold of them with their eye  5  12 the sleep of a labour man is sweet  whether he eat littl or much  but the abund of the rich will not suffer him to sleep  5  13 there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun  name  rich kept for the owner thereof to their hurt  5  14 but those rich perish by evil travail  and he begetteth a son  and there is noth in his hand  5  15 as he came forth of his mother  s womb  nake shall he return to go as he came  and shall take noth of his labour  which he may carri away in his hand  5  16 and this also is a sore evil  that in all point as he came  so shall he go  and what profit hath he that hath labour for the wind  5  17 all his day also he eateth in dark  and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sick  5  18 behold that which i have seen  it is good and come for one to eat and to drink  and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the day of his life  which god giveth him  for it is his portion  5  19 everi man also to whom god hath given rich and wealth  and hath given him power to eat thereof  and to take his portion  and to rejoic in his labour  this is the gift of god  5  20 for he shall not much rememb the day of his life  becaus god answereth him in the joy of his heart  6  1 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun  and it is common among men  6  2 a man to whom god hath given rich  wealth  and honour  so that he wanteth noth for his soul of all that he desireth  yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof  but a stranger eateth it  this is vaniti  and it is an evil diseas  6  3 if a man beget an hundr children  and live mani year  so that the day of his year be mani  and his soul be not fill with good  and also that he have no burial  i say  that an untim birth is better than he  6  4 for he cometh in with vaniti  and departeth in dark  and his name shall be cover with dark  6  5 moreov he hath not seen the sun  nor known ani thing  this hath more rest than the other  6  6 yea  though he live a thousand year twice told  yet hath he seen no good  do not all go to one place  6  7 all the labour of man is for his mouth  and yet the appetit is not fill  6  8 for what hath the wise more than the fool  what hath the poor  that knoweth to walk befor the live  6  9 better is the sight of the eye than the wander of the desir  this is also vaniti and vexat of spirit  6  10 that which hath been is name alreadi  and it is known that it is man  neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he  6  11 see there be mani thing that increas vaniti  what is man the better  6  12 for who knoweth what is good for man in this life  all the day of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow  for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun  7  1 a good name is better than precious ointment  and the day of death than the day of one  s birth  7  2 it is better to go to the hous of mourn  than to go to the hous of feast  for that is the end of all men  and the live will lay it to his heart  7  3 sorrow is better than laughter  for by the sad of the counten the heart is made better  7  4 the heart of the wise is in the hous of mourn  but the heart of fool is in the hous of mirth  7  5 it is better to hear the rebuk of the wise  than for a man to hear the song of fool  7  6 for as the crackl of thorn under a pot  so is the laughter of the fool  this also is vaniti  7  7 sure oppress maketh a wise man mad  and a gift destroyeth the heart  7  8 better is the end of a thing than the begin thereof  and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit  7  9 be not hasti in thi spirit to be angri  for anger resteth in the bosom of fool  7  10 say not thou  what is the caus that the former day were better than these  for thou dost not enquir wise concern this  7  11 wisdom is good with an inherit  and by it there is profit to them that see the sun  7  12 for wisdom is a defenc  and money is a defenc  but the excel of knowledg is  that wisdom giveth life to them that have it  7  13 consid the work of god  for who can make that straight  which he hath made crook  7  14 in the day of prosper be joy  but in the day of advers consid  god also hath set the one over against the other  to the end that man should find noth after him  7  15 all thing have i seen in the day of my vaniti  there is a just man that perisheth in his righteous  and there is a wick man that prolongeth his life in his wicked  7  16 be not righteous over much  neither make thyself over wise  whi shouldest thou destroy thyself  7  17 be not over much wick  neither be thou foolish  whi shouldest thou die befor thi time  7  18 it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this  yea  also from this withdraw not thine hand  for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all  7  19 wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighti men which are in the citi  7  20 for there is not a just man upon earth  that doeth good  and sinneth not  7  21 also take no heed unto all word that are spoken  lest thou hear thi servant curs thee  7  22 for oftentim also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewis hast curs other  7  23 all this have i prove by wisdom  i said  i will be wise  but it was far from me  7  24 that which is far off  and exceed deep  who can find it out  7  25 i appli mine heart to know  and to search  and to seek out wisdom  and the reason of thing  and to know the wicked of folli  even of foolish and mad  7  26 and i find more bitter than death the woman  whose heart is snare and net  and her hand as band  whoso pleaseth god shall escap from her  but the sinner shall be taken by her  7  27 behold  this have i found  saith the preacher  count one by one  to find out the account  7  28 which yet my soul seeketh  but i find not  one man among a thousand have i found  but a woman among all those have i not found  7  29 lo  this onli have i found  that god hath made man upright  but they have sought out mani invent  8  1 who is as the wise man  and who knoweth the interpret of a thing  a man  s wisdom maketh his face to shine  and the bold of his face shall be chang  8  2 i counsel thee to keep the king  s command  and that in regard of the oath of god  8  3 be not hasti to go out of his sight  stand not in an evil thing  for he doeth whatsoev pleaseth him  8  4 where the word of a king is  there is power  and who may say unto him  what doest thou  8  5 whoso keepeth the command shall feel no evil thing  and a wise man  s heart discerneth both time and judgment  8  6 becaus to everi purpos there is time and judgment  therefor the miseri of man is great upon him  8  7 for he knoweth not that which shall be  for who can tell him when it shall be  8  8 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit  neither hath he power in the day of death  and there is no discharg in that war  neither shall wicked deliv those that are given to it  8  9 all this have i seen  and appli my heart unto everi work that is done under the sun  there is a time wherein one man ruleth over anoth to his own hurt  8  10 and so i saw the wick buri  who had come and gone from the place of the holi  and they were forgotten in the citi where they had so done  this is also vaniti  8  11 becaus sentenc against an evil work is not execut speedili  therefor the heart of the son of men is fulli set in them to do evil  8  12 though a sinner do evil an hundr time  and his day be prolong  yet sure i know that it shall be well with them that fear god  which fear befor him  8  13 but it shall not be well with the wick  neither shall he prolong his day  which are as a shadow  becaus he feareth not befor god  8  14 there is a vaniti which is done upon the earth  that there be just men  unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wick  again  there be wick men  to whom it happeneth accord to the work of the righteous  i said that this also is vaniti  8  15 then i commend mirth  becaus a man hath no better thing under the sun  than to eat  and to drink  and to be merri  for that shall abid with him of his labour the day of his life  which god giveth him under the sun  8  16 when i appli mine heart to know wisdom  and to see the busi that is done upon the earth   for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eye  8  17 then i beheld all the work of god  that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun  becaus though a man labour to seek it out  yet he shall not find it  yea farther  though a wise man think to know it  yet shall he not be abl to find it  9  1 for all this i consid in my heart even to declar all this  that the righteous  and the wise  and their work  are in the hand of god  no man knoweth either love or hatr by all that is befor them  9  2 all thing come alik to all  there is one event to the righteous  and to the wick  to the good and to the clean  and to the unclean  to him that sacrificeth  and to him that sacrificeth not  as is the good  so is the sinner  and he that sweareth  as he that feareth an oath  9  3 this is an evil among all thing that are done under the sun  that there is one event unto all  yea  also the heart of the son of men is full of evil  and mad is in their heart while they live  and after that they go to the dead  9  4 for to him that is join to all the live there is hope  for a live dog is better than a dead lion  9  5 for the live know that they shall die  but the dead know not ani thing  neither have they ani more a reward  for the memori of them is forgotten  9  6 also their love  and their hatr  and their envi  is now perish  neither have they ani more a portion for ever in ani thing that is done under the sun  9  7 go thi way  eat thi bread with joy  and drink thi wine with a merri heart  for god now accepteth thi work  9  8 let thi garment be alway white  and let thi head lack no ointment  9  9 live joy with the wife whom thou lovest all the day of the life of thi vaniti  which he hath given thee under the sun  all the day of thi vaniti  for that is thi portion in this life  and in thi labour which thou takest under the sun  9  10 whatsoev thi hand findeth to do  do it with thi might  for there is no work  nor devic  nor knowledg  nor wisdom  in the grave  whither thou goest  9  11 i return  and saw under the sun  that the race is not to the swift  nor the battl to the strong  neither yet bread to the wise  nor yet rich to men of understand  nor yet favour to men of skill  but time and chanc happeneth to them all  9  12 for man also knoweth not his time  as the fish that are taken in an evil net  and as the bird that are caught in the snare  so are the son of men snare in an evil time  when it falleth sudden upon them  9  13 this wisdom have i seen also under the sun  and it seem great unto me  9  14 there was a littl citi  and few men within it  and there came a great king against it  and besieg it  and built great bulwark against it  9  15 now there was found in it a poor wise man  and he by his wisdom deliv the citi  yet no man rememb that same poor man  9  16 then said i  wisdom is better than strength  nevertheless the poor man  s wisdom is despis  and his word are not heard  9  17 the word of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cri of him that ruleth among fool  9  18 wisdom is better than weapon of war  but one sinner destroyeth much good  10  1 dead fli caus the ointment of the apothecari to send forth a stink savour  so doth a littl folli him that is in reput for wisdom and honour  10  2 a wise man  s heart is at his right hand  but a fool  s heart at his left  10  3 yea also  when he that is a fool walketh by the way  his wisdom faileth him  and he saith to everi one that he is a fool  10  4 if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee  leav not thi place  for yield pacifieth great offenc  10  5 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun  as an error which proceedeth from the ruler  10  6 folli is set in great digniti  and the rich sit in low place  10  7 i have seen servant upon hors  and princ walk as servant upon the earth  10  8 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it  and whoso breaketh an hedg  a serpent shall bite him  10  9 whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith  and he that cleaveth wood shall be endang therebi  10  10 if the iron be blunt  and he do not whet the edg  then must he put to more strength  but wisdom is profit to direct  10  11 sure the serpent will bite without enchant  and a babbler is no better  10  12 the word of a wise man  s mouth are gracious  but the lip of a fool will swallow up himself  10  13 the begin of the word of his mouth is foolish  and the end of his talk is mischiev mad  10  14 a fool also is full of word  a man cannot tell what shall be  and what shall be after him  who can tell him  10  15 the labour of the foolish wearieth everi one of them  becaus he knoweth not how to go to the citi  10  16 woe to thee  o land  when thi king is a child  and thi princ eat in the morn  10  17 bless art thou  o land  when thi king is the son of nobl  and thi princ eat in due season  for strength  and not for drunken  10  18 by much sloth the build decayeth  and through idl of the hand the hous droppeth through  10  19 a feast is made for laughter  and wine maketh merri  but money answereth all thing  10  20 curs not the king  no not in thi thought  and curs not the rich in thi bedchamb  for a bird of the air shall carri the voic  and that which hath wing shall tell the matter  11  1 cast thi bread upon the water  for thou shalt find it after mani day  11  2 give a portion to seven  and also to eight  for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth  11  3 if the cloud be full of rain  they empti themselv upon the earth  and if the tree fall toward the south  or toward the north  in the place where the tree falleth  there it shall be  11  4 he that observeth the wind shall not sow  and he that regardeth the cloud shall not reap  11  5 as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit  nor how the bone do grow in the womb of her that is with child  even so thou knowest not the work of god who maketh all  11  6 in the morn sow thi seed  and in the even withhold not thine hand  for thou knowest not whether shall prosper  either this or that  or whether they both shall be alik good  11  7 truli the light is sweet  and a pleasant thing it is for the eye to behold the sun  11  8 but if a man live mani year  and rejoic in them all  yet let him rememb the day of dark  for they shall be mani  all that cometh is vaniti  11  9 rejoic  o young man  in

made a winepress therein  and he look that it should bring forth grape  and it brought forth wild grape  5  3 and now  o inhabit of jerusalem  and men of judah  judg  i pray you  betwixt me and my vineyard  5  4 what could have been done more to my vineyard  that i have not done in it  wherefor  when i look that it should bring forth grape  brought it forth wild grape  5  5 and now go to  i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard  i will take away the hedg thereof  and it shall be eaten up  and break down the wall thereof  and it shall be trodden down  5  6 and i will lay it wast  it shall not be prune  nor dig  but there shall come up brier and thorn  i will also command the cloud that they rain no rain upon it  5  7 for the vineyard of the lord of host is the hous of israel  and the men of judah his pleasant plant  and he look for judgment  but behold oppress  for righteous  but behold a cri  5  8 woe unto them that join hous to hous  that lay field to field  till there be no place  that they may be place alon in the midst of the earth  5  9 in mine ear said the lord of host  of a truth mani hous shall be desol  even great and fair  without inhabit  5  10 yea  ten acr of vineyard shall yield one bath  and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah  5  11 woe unto them that rise up earli in the morn  that they may follow strong drink  that continu until night  till wine inflam them  5  12 and the harp  and the viol  the tabret  and pipe  and wine  are in their feast  but they regard not the work of the lord  neither consid the oper of his hand  5  13 therefor my peopl are gone into captiv  becaus they have no knowledg  and their honour men are famish  and their multitud dri up with thirst  5  14 therefor hell hath enlarg herself  and open her mouth without measur  and their glori  and their multitud  and their pomp  and he that rejoiceth  shall descend into it  5  15 and the mean man shall be brought down  and the mighti man shall be humbl  and the eye of the lofti shall be humbl  5  16 but the lord of host shall be exalt in judgment  and god that is holi shall be sanctifi in righteous  5  17 then shall the lamb feed after their manner  and the wast place of the fat one shall stranger eat  5  18 woe unto them that draw iniqu with cord of vaniti  and sin as it were with a cart rope  5  19 that say  let him make speed  and hasten his work  that we may see it  and let the counsel of the holi one of israel draw nigh and come  that we may know it  5  20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put dark for light  and light for dark  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter  5  21 woe unto them that are wise in their own eye  and prudent in their own sight  5  22 woe unto them that are mighti to drink wine  and men of strength to mingl strong drink  5  23 which justifi the wick for reward  and take away the righteous of the righteous from him  5  24 therefor as the fire devoureth the stubbl  and the flame consumeth the chaff  so their root shall be as rotten  and their blossom shall go up as dust  becaus they have cast away the law of the lord of host  and despis the word of the holi one of israel  5  25 therefor is the anger of the lord kindl against his peopl  and he hath stretch forth his hand against them  and hath smitten them  and the hill did trembl  and their carcas were torn in the midst of the street  for all this his anger is not turn away  but his hand is stretch out still  5  26 and he will lift up an ensign to the nation from far  and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth  and  behold  they shall come with speed swift  5  27 none shall be weari nor stumbl among them  none shall slumber nor sleep  neither shall the girdl of their loin be loos  nor the latchet of their shoe be broken  5  28 whose arrow are sharp  and all their bow bent  their hors  hoof shall be count like flint  and their wheel like a whirlwind  5  29 their roar shall be like a lion  they shall roar like young lion  yea  they shall roar  and lay hold of the prey  and shall carri it away safe  and none shall deliv it  5  30 and in that day they shall roar against them like the roar of the sea  and if one look unto the land  behold dark and sorrow  and the light is darken in the heaven thereof  6  1 in the year that king uzziah die i saw also the lord sit upon a throne  high and lift up  and his train fill the templ  6  2 abov it stood the seraphim  each one had six wing  with twain he cover his face  and with twain he cover his feet  and with twain he did fli  6  3 and one cri unto anoth  and said  holi  holi  holi  is the lord of host  the whole earth is full of his glori  6  4 and the post of the door move at the voic of him that cri  and the hous was fill with smoke  6  5 then said i  woe is me  for i am undon  becaus i am a man of unclean lip  and i dwell in the midst of a peopl of unclean lip  for mine eye have seen the king  the lord of host  6  6 then flew one of the seraphim unto me  have a live coal in his hand  which he had taken with the tong from off the altar  6  7 and he laid it upon my mouth  and said  lo  this hath touch thi lip  and thine iniqu is taken away  and thi sin purg  6  8 also i heard the voic of the lord  say  whom shall i send  and who will go for us  then said i  here am i  send me  6  9 and he said  go  and tell this peopl  hear ye inde  but understand not  and see ye inde  but perceiv not  6  10 make the heart of this peopl fat  and make their ear heavi  and shut their eye  lest they see with their eye  and hear with their ear  and understand with their heart  and convert  and be heal  6  11 then said i  lord  how long  and he answer  until the citi be wast without inhabit  and the hous without man  and the land be utter desol  6  12 and the lord have remov men far away  and there be a great forsak in the midst of the land  6  13 but yet in it shall be a tenth  and it shall return  and shall be eaten  as a teil tree  and as an oak  whose substanc is in them  when they cast their leav  so the holi seed shall be the substanc thereof  7  1 and it came to pass in the day of ahaz the son of jotham  the son of uzziah  king of judah  that rezin the king of syria  and pekah the son of remaliah  king of israel  went up toward jerusalem to war against it  but could not prevail against it  7  2 and it was told the hous of david  say  syria is confeder with ephraim  and his heart was move  and the heart of his peopl  as the tree of the wood are move with the wind  7  3 then said the lord unto isaiah  go forth now to meet ahaz  thou  and shearjashub thi son  at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller  s field  7  4 and say unto him  take heed  and be quiet  fear not  neither be faintheart for the two tail of these smoke firebrand  for the fierc anger of rezin with syria  and of the son of remaliah  7  5 becaus syria  ephraim  and the son of remaliah  have taken evil counsel against thee  say  7  6 let us go up against judah  and vex it  and let us make a breach therein for us  and set a king in the midst of it  even the son of tabeal  7  7 thus saith the lord god  it shall not stand  neither shall it come to pass  7  8 for the head of syria is damascus  and the head of damascus is rezin  and within threescor and five year shall ephraim be broken  that it be not a peopl  7  9 and the head of ephraim is samaria  and the head of samaria is remaliah  s son  if ye will not believ  sure ye shall not be establish  7  10 moreov the lord spake again unto ahaz  say  7  11 ask thee a sign of the lord thi god  ask it either in the depth  or in the height abov  7  12 but ahaz said  i will not ask  neither will i tempt the lord  7  13 and he said  hear ye now  o hous of david  is it a small thing for you to weari men  but will ye weari my god also  7  14 therefor the lord himself shall give you a sign  behold  a virgin shall conceiv  and bear a son  and shall call his name immanuel  7  15 butter and honey shall he eat  that he may know to refus the evil  and choos the good  7  16 for befor the child shall know to refus the evil  and choos the good  the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her king  7  17 the lord shall bring upon thee  and upon thi peopl  and upon thi father  s hous  day that have not come  from the day that ephraim depart from judah  even the king of assyria  7  18 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the lord shall hiss for the fli that is in the uttermost part of the river of egypt  and for the bee that is in the land of assyria  7  19 and they shall come  and shall rest all of them in the desol valley  and in the hole of the rock  and upon all thorn  and upon all bush  7  20 in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hire  name  by them beyond the river  by the king of assyria  the head  and the hair of the feet  and it shall also consum the beard  7  21 and it shall come to pass in that day  that a man shall nourish a young cow  and two sheep  7  22 and it shall come to pass  for the abund of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter  for butter and honey shall everi one eat that is left in the land  7  23 and it shall come to pass in that day  that everi place shall be  where there were a thousand vine at a thousand silverl  it shall even be for brier and thorn  7  24 with arrow and with bow shall men come thither  becaus all the land shall becom brier and thorn  7  25 and on all hill that shall be dig with the mattock  there shall not come thither the fear of brier and thorn  but it shall be for the send forth of oxen  and for the tread of lesser cattl  8  1 moreov the lord said unto me  take thee a great roll  and write in it with a man  s pen concern mahershalalhashbaz  8  2 and i took unto me faith wit to record  uriah the priest  and zechariah the son of jeberechiah  8  3 and i went unto the prophetess  and she conceiv  and bare a son  then said the lord to me  call his name mahershalalhashbaz  8  4 for befor the child shall have knowledg to cri  my father  and my mother  the rich of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away befor the king of assyria  8  5 the lord spake also unto me again  say  8  6 forasmuch as this peopl refuseth the water of shiloah that go soft  and rejoic in rezin and remaliah  s son  8  7 now therefor  behold  the lord bringeth up upon them the water of the river  strong and mani  even the king of assyria  and all his glori  and he shall come up over all his channel  and go over all his bank  8  8 and he shall pass through judah  he shall overflow and go over  he shall reach even to the neck  and the stretch out of his wing shall fill the breadth of thi land  o immanuel  8  9 associ yourselv  o ye peopl  and ye shall be broken in piec  and give ear  all ye of far countri  gird yourselv  and ye shall be broken in piec  gird yourselv  and ye shall be broken in piec  8  10 take counsel togeth  and it shall come to nought  speak the word  and it shall not stand  for god is with us  8  11 for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand  and instruct me that i should not walk in the way of this peopl  say  8  12 say ye not  a confederaci  to all them to whom this peopl shall say  a confederaci  neither fear ye their fear  nor be afraid  8  13 sanctifi the lord of host himself  and let him be your fear  and let him be your dread  8  14 and he shall be for a sanctuari  but for a stone of stumbl and for a rock of offenc to both the hous of israel  for a gin and for a snare to the inhabit of jerusalem  8  15 and mani among them shall stumbl  and fall  and be broken  and be snare  and be taken  8  16 bind up the testimoni  seal the law among my discipl  8  17 and i will wait upon the lord  that hideth his face from the hous of jacob  and i will look for him  8  18 behold  i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for sign and for wonder in israel from the lord of host  which dwelleth in mount zion  8  19 and when they shall say unto you  seek unto them that have familiar spirit  and unto wizard that peep  and that mutter  should not a peopl seek unto their god  for the live to the dead  8  20 to the law and to the testimoni  if they speak not accord to this word  it is becaus there is no light in them  8  21 and they shall pass through it  hard bestead and hungri  and it shall come to pass  that when they shall be hungri  they shall fret themselv  and curs their king and their god  and look upward  8  22 and they shall look unto the earth  and behold troubl and dark  dim of anguish  and they shall be driven to dark  9  1 nevertheless the dim shall not be such as was in her vexat  when at the first he light afflict the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali  and afterward did more grievous afflict her by the way of the sea  beyond jordan  in galile of the nation  9  2 the peopl that walk in dark have seen a great light  they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death  upon them hath the light shine  9  3 thou hast multipli the nation  and not increas the joy  they joy befor thee accord to the joy in harvest  and as men rejoic when they divid the spoil  9  4 for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden  and the staff of his shoulder  the rod of his oppressor  as in the day of midian  9  5 for everi battl of the warrior is with confus nois  and garment roll in blood  but this shall be with burn and fuel of fire  9  6 for unto us a child is born  unto us a son is given  and the govern shall be upon his shoulder  and his name shall be call wonder  counsellor  the mighti god  the everlast father  the princ of peac  9  7 of the increas of his govern and peac there shall be no end  upon the throne of david  and upon his kingdom  to order it  and to establish it with judgment and with justic from henceforth even for ever  the zeal of the lord of host will perform this  9  8 the lord sent a word into jacob  and it hath light upon israel  9  9 and all the peopl shall know  even ephraim and the inhabit of samaria  that say in the pride and stout of heart  9  10 the brick are fallen down  but we will build with hewn stone  the sycomor are cut down  but we will chang them into cedar  9  11 therefor the lord shall set up the adversari of rezin against him  and join his enemi togeth  9  12 the syrian befor  and the philistin behind  and they shall devour israel with open mouth  for all this his anger is not turn away  but his hand is stretch out still  9  13 for the peopl turneth not unto him that smiteth them  neither do they seek the lord of host  9  14 therefor the lord will cut off from israel head and tail  branch and rush  in one day  9  15 the ancient and honour  he is the head  and the prophet that teacheth lie  he is the tail  9  16 for the leader of this peopl caus them to err  and they that are led of them are destroy  9  17 therefor the lord shall have no joy in their young men  neither shall have merci on their fatherless and widow  for everi one is an hypocrit and an evildo  and everi mouth speaketh folli  for all this his anger is not turn away  but his hand is stretch out still  9  18 for wicked burneth as the fire  it shall devour the brier and thorn  and shall kindl in the thicket of the forest  and they shall mount up like the lift up of smoke  9  19 through the wrath of the lord of host is the land darken  and the peopl shall be as the fuel of the fire  no man shall spare his brother  9  20 and he shall snatch on the right hand  and be hungri  and he shall eat on the left hand  and they shall not be satisfi  they shall eat everi man the flesh of his own arm  9  21 manasseh  ephraim  and ephraim  manasseh  and they togeth shall be against judah  for all this his anger is not turn away  but his hand is stretch out still  10  1 woe unto them that decre unright decre  and that write grievous which they have prescrib  10  2 to turn asid the needi from judgment  and to take away the right from the poor of my peopl  that widow may be their prey  and that they may rob the fatherless  10  3 and what will ye do in the day of visit  and in the desol which shall come from far  to whom will ye flee for help  and where will ye leav your glori  10  4 without me they shall bow down under the prison  and they shall fall under the slain  for all this his anger is not turn away  but his hand is stretch out still  10  5 o assyrian  the rod of mine anger  and the staff in their hand is mine indign  10  6 i will send him against an hypocrit nation  and against the peopl of my wrath will i give him a charg  to take the spoil  and to take the prey  and to tread them down like the mire of the street  10  7 howbeit he meaneth not so  neither doth his heart think so  but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nation not a few  10  8 for he saith  are not my princ altogeth king  10  9 is not calno as carchemish  is not hamath as arpad  is not samaria as damascus  10  10 as my hand hath found the kingdom of the idol  and whose graven imag did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria  10  11 shall i not  as i have done unto samaria and her idol  so do to jerusalem and her idol  10  12 wherefor it shall come to pass  that when the lord hath perform his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem  i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria  and the glori of his high look  10  13 for he saith  by the strength of my hand i have done it  and by my wisdom  for i am prudent  and i have remov the bound of the peopl  and have rob their treasur  and i have put down the inhabit like a valiant man  10  14 and my hand hath found as a nest the rich of the peopl  and as one gathereth egg that are left  have i gather all the earth  and there was none that move the wing  or open the mouth  or peep  10  15 shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith  or shall the saw magnifi itself against him that shaketh it  as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up  or as if the staff should lift up itself  as if it were no wood  10  16 therefor shall the lord  the lord of host  send among his fat one lean  and under his glori he shall kindl a burn like the burn of a fire  10  17 and the light of israel shall be for a fire  and his holi one for a flame  and it shall burn and devour his thorn and his brier in one day  10  18 and shall consum the glori of his forest  and of his fruit field  both soul and bodi  and they shall be as when a standard  bearer fainteth  10  19 and the rest of the tree of his forest shall be few  that a child may write them  10  20 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the remnant of israel  and such as are escap of the hous of jacob  shall no more again stay upon him that smote them  but shall stay upon the lord  the holi one of israel  in truth  10  21 the remnant shall return  even the remnant of jacob  unto the mighti god  10  22 for though thi peopl israel be as the sand of the sea  yet a remnant of them shall return  the consumpt decre shall overflow with righteous  10  23 for the lord god of host shall make a consumpt  even determin  in the midst of all the land  10  24 therefor thus saith the lord god of host  o my peopl that dwellest in zion  be not afraid of the assyrian  he shall smite thee with a rod  and shall lift up his staff against thee  after the manner of egypt  10  25 for yet a veri littl while  and the indign shall ceas  and mine anger in their destruct  10  26 and the lord of host shall stir up a scourg for him accord to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb  and as his rod was upon the sea  so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt  10  27 and it shall come to pass in that day  that his burden shall be taken away from off thi shoulder  and his yoke from off thi neck  and the yoke shall be destroy becaus of the anoint  10  28 he is come to aiath  he is pass to migron  at michmash he hath laid up his carriag  10  29 they are gone over the passag  they have taken up their lodg at geba  ramah is afraid  gibeah of saul is fled  10  30 lift up thi voic  o daughter of gallim  caus it to be heard unto laish  o poor anathoth  10  31 madmenah is remov  the inhabit of gebim gather themselv to flee  10  32 as yet shall he remain at nob that day  he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion  the hill of jerusalem  10  33 behold  the lord  the lord of host  shall lop the bough with terror  and the high one of statur shall be hewn down  and the haughti shall be humbl  10  34 and he shall cut down the thicket of the forest with iron  and lebanon shall fall by a mighti one  11  1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jess  and a branch shall grow out of his root  11  2 and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him  the spirit of wisdom and understand  the spirit of counsel and might  the spirit of knowledg and of the fear of the lord  11  3 and shall make him of quick understand in the fear of the lord  and he shall not judg after the sight of his eye  neither reprov after the hear of his ear  11  4 but with righteous shall he judg the poor  and reprov with equiti for the meek of the earth  and he shall smite the earth  with the rod of his mouth  and with the breath of his lip shall he slay the wick  11  5 and righteous shall be the girdl of his loin  and faith the girdl of his rein  11  6 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb  and the leopard shall lie down with the kid  and the calf and the young lion and the fatl togeth  and a littl child shall lead them  11  7 and the cow and the bear shall feed  their young one shall lie down togeth  and the lion shall eat straw like the ox  11  8 and the suck child shall play on the hole of the asp  and the wean child shall put his hand on the cockatric  den  11  9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holi mountain  for the earth shall be full of the knowledg of the lord  as the water cover the sea  11  10 and in that day there shall be a root of jess  which shall stand for an ensign of the peopl  to it shall the gentil seek  and his rest shall be glorious  11  11 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recov the remnant of his peopl  which shall be left  from assyria  and from egypt  and from pathro  and from cush  and from elam  and from shinar  and from hamath  and from the island of the sea  11  12 and he shall set up an ensign for the nation  and shall assembl the outcast of israel  and gather togeth the dispers of judah from the four corner of the earth  11  13 the envi also of ephraim shall depart  and the adversari of judah shall be cut off  ephraim shall not envi judah  and judah shall not vex ephraim  11  14 but they shall fli upon the shoulder of the philistin toward the west  they shall spoil them of the east togeth  they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab  and the children of ammon shall obey them  11  15 and the lord shall utter destroy the tongu of the egyptian sea  and with his mighti wind shall he shake his hand over the river  and shall smite it in the seven stream  and make men go over dryshod  11  16 and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his peopl  which shall be left  from assyria  like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt  12  1 and in that day thou shalt say  o lord  i will prais thee  though thou wast angri with me  thine anger is turn away  and thou comfortedst me  12  2 behold  god is my salvat  i will trust  and not be afraid  for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song  he also is becom my salvat  12  3 therefor with joy shall ye draw water out of the well of salvat  12  4 and in that day shall ye say  prais the lord  call upon his name  declar his do among the peopl  make mention that his name is exalt  12  5 sing unto the lord  for he hath done excel thing  this is

2 lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain  exalt the voic unto them  shake the hand  that they may go into the gate of the nobl  13  3 i have command my sanctifi one  i have also call my mighti one for mine anger  even them that rejoic in my high  13  4 the nois of a multitud in the mountain  like as of a great peopl  a tumultu nois of the kingdom of nation gather togeth  the lord of host mustereth the host of the battl  13  5 they come from a far countri  from the end of heaven  even the lord  and the weapon of his indign  to destroy the whole land  13  6 howl ye  for the day of the lord is at hand  it shall come as a destruct from the almighti  13  7 therefor shall all hand be faint  and everi man  s heart shall melt  13  8 and they shall be afraid  pang and sorrow shall take

the haughti of the terribl  13  12 i will make a man more precious than fine gold  even a man than the golden wedg of ophir  13  13 therefor i will shake the heaven  and the earth shall remov out of her place  in the wrath of the lord of host  and in the day of his fierc anger  13  14 and it shall be as the chase roe  and as a sheep that no man taketh up  they shall everi man turn to his own

 and satyr shall danc there  13  22 and the wild beast of the island shall cri in their desol hous  and dragon in their pleasant palac  and her time is near to come  and her day shall not be prolong  14  1 for the lord will have merci on jacob  and will yet choos israel  and set them in their own land  and the stranger shall be join with them  and they shall cleav to the hous of jacob  14  2 and

the earth also shall disclos her blood  and shall no more cover her slain  27  1 in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the pierc serpent  even leviathan that crook serpent  and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea  27  2 in that day sing ye unto her  a vineyard of red wine  27  3 i the lord do keep it  i will water it everi moment  lest ani

my strength  that he may make peac with me  and he shall make peac with me  27  6 he shall caus them that come of jacob to take root  israel shall blossom and bud  and fill the face of the world with fruit  27  7 hath he smitten him  as he smote those that smote him  or is he slain accord to the slaughter of them that are slain by him  27  8 in measur  when it shooteth forth  thou wilt debat with it  he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind  27  9 by this therefor shall the iniqu of jacob be purg  and this is all the fruit to take away his sin  when he maketh all the stone of the altar as chalkston that are beaten in sunder  the grove and imag shall not stand up  27  10 yet the defenc citi shall be desol  and the habit forsaken  and left like a wilder  there shall the calf feed  and there shall he lie down  and consum the branch thereof  27  11 when the bough thereof are wither  they shall be broken off  the women come  and set them on fire  for it is a peopl of no understand  therefor he that made them will not have merci on them  and he that form them will shew them no favour  27  12 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt  and ye shall be gather one by one  o ye children of israel  27  13 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the great trumpet shall be blown  and they shall come which were readi to perish in the land of assyria  and the outcast in the land of egypt  and shall worship the lord in the holi mount at jerusalem  28  1 woe to the crown of pride  to the drunkard of ephraim  whose glorious beauti is a fade flower  which are on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcom with wine  28  2 behold  the lord hath a mighti and strong one  which as a tempest of hail and a destroy storm  as a flood of mighti water overflow  shall cast down to the earth with the hand  28  3 the crown of pride  the drunkard of ephraim  shall be trodden under feet  28  4 and the glorious beauti  which is on the head of the fat valley  shall be a fade flower  and as the hasti fruit befor the summer  which when he that looketh upon it seeth  while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up  28  5 in that day shall the lord of host be for a crown of glori  and for a diadem of beauti  unto the residu of his peopl  28  6 and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment  and for strength to them that turn the battl to the gate  28  7 but they also have er through wine  and through strong drink are out of the way  the priest and the prophet have er through strong drink  they are swallow up of wine  they are out of the way through strong drink  they err in vision  they stumbl in judgment  28  8 for all tabl are full of vomit and filthi  so that there is no place clean  28  9 whom shall he teach knowledg  and whom shall he make to understand doctrin  them that are wean from the milk  and drawn from the breast  28  10 for precept must be upon precept  precept upon precept  line upon line  line upon line  here a littl  and there a littl  28  11 for with stammer lip and anoth tongu will he speak to this peopl  28  12 to whom he said  this is the rest wherewith ye may caus the weari to rest  and this is the refresh  yet they would not hear  28  13 but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept  precept upon precept  line upon line  line upon line  here a littl  and there a littl  that they might go  and fall backward  and be broken  and snare  and taken  28  14 wherefor hear the word of the lord  ye scorn men  that rule this peopl which is in jerusalem  28  15 becaus ye have said  we have made a coven with death  and with hell are we at agreement  when the overflow scourg shall pass through  it shall not come unto us  for we have made lie our refug  and under falsehood have we hid ourselv  28  16 therefor thus saith the lord god  behold  i lay in zion for a foundat a stone  a tri stone  a precious corner stone  a sure foundat  he that believeth shall not make hast  28  17 judgment also will i lay to the line  and righteous to the plummet  and the hail shall sweep away the refug of lie  and the water shall overflow the hide place  28  18 and your coven with death shall be disannul  and your agreement with hell shall not stand  when the overflow scourg shall pass through  then ye shall be trodden down by it  28  19 from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you  for morn by morn shall it pass over  by day and by night  and it shall be a vexat onli to understand the report  28  20 for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it  and the cover narrow than that he can wrap himself in it  28  21 for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim  he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon  that he may do his work  his strang work  and bring to pass his act  his strang act  28  22 now therefor be ye not mocker  lest your band be made strong  for i have heard from the lord god of host a consumpt  even determin upon the whole earth  28  23 give ye ear  and hear my voic  hearken  and hear my speech  28  24 doth the plowman plow all day to sow  doth he open and break the clod of his ground  28  25 when he hath made plain the face thereof  doth he not cast abroad the fitch  and scatter the cummin  and cast in the princip wheat and the appoint barley and the rie in their place  28  26 for his god doth instruct him to discret  and doth teach him  28  27 for the fitch are not thresh with a thresh instrument  neither is a cart wheel turn about upon the cummin  but the fitch are beaten out with a staff  and the cummin with a rod  28  28 bread corn is bruis  becaus he will not ever be thresh it  nor break it with the wheel of his cart  nor bruis it with his horsemen  28  29 this also cometh forth from the lord of host  which is wonder in counsel  and excel in work  29  1 woe to ariel  to ariel  the citi where david dwelt  add ye year to year  let them kill sacrific  29  2 yet i will distress ariel  and there shall be heavi and sorrow  and it shall be unto me as ariel  29  3 and i will camp against thee round about  and will lay sieg against thee with a mount  and i will rais fort against thee  29  4 and thou shalt be brought down  and shalt speak out of the ground  and thi speech shall be low out of the dust  and thi voic shall be  as of one that hath a familiar spirit  out of the ground  and thi speech shall whisper out of the dust  29  5 moreov the multitud of thi stranger shall be like small dust  and the multitud of the terribl one shall be as chaff that passeth away  yea  it shall be at an instant sudden  29  6 thou shalt be visit of the lord of host with thunder  and with earthquak  and great nois  with storm and tempest  and the flame of devour fire  29  7 and the multitud of all the nation that fight against ariel  even all that fight against her and her munit  and that distress her  shall be as a dream of a night vision  29  8 it shall even be as when an hungri man dreameth  and  behold  he eateth  but he awaketh  and his soul is empti  or as when a thirsti man dreameth  and  behold  he drinketh  but he awaketh  and  behold  he is faint  and his soul hath appetit  so shall the multitud of all the nation be  that fight against mount zion  29  9 stay yourselv  and wonder  cri ye out  and cri  they are drunken  but not with wine  they stagger  but not with strong drink  29  10 for the lord hath pour out upon you the spirit of deep sleep  and hath close your eye  the prophet and your ruler  the seer hath he cover  29  11 and the vision of all is becom unto you as the word of a book that is seal  which men deliv to one that is learn  say  read this  i pray thee  and he saith  i cannot  for it is seal  29  12 and the book is deliv to him that is not learn  say  read this  i pray thee  and he saith  i am not learn  29  13 wherefor the lord said  forasmuch as this peopl draw near me with their mouth  and with their lip do honour me  but have remov their heart far from me  and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men  29  14 therefor  behold  i will proceed to do a marvel work among this peopl  even a marvel work and a wonder  for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish  and the understand of their prudent men shall be hid  29  15 woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord  and their work are in the dark  and they say  who seeth us  and who knoweth us  29  16 sure your turn of thing upsid down shall be esteem as the potter  s clay  for shall the work say of him that made it  he made me not  or shall the thing frame say of him that frame it  he had no understand  29  17 is it not yet a veri littl while  and lebanon shall be turn into a fruit field  and the fruit field shall be esteem as a forest  29  18 and in that day shall the deaf hear the word of the book  and the eye of the blind shall see out of obscur  and out of dark  29  19 the meek also shall increas their joy in the lord  and the poor among men shall rejoic in the holi one of israel  29  20 for the terribl one is brought to nought  and the scorner is consum  and all that watch for iniqu are cut off  29  21 that make a man an offend for a word  and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate  and turn asid the just for a thing of nought  29  22 therefor thus saith the lord  who redeem abraham  concern the hous of jacob  jacob shall not now be asham  neither shall his face now wax pale  29  23 but when he seeth his children  the work of mine hand  in the midst of him  they shall sanctifi my name  and sanctifi the holi one of jacob  and shall fear the god of israel  29  24 they also that er in spirit shall come to understand  and they that murmur shall learn doctrin  30  1 woe to the rebelli children  saith the lord  that take counsel  but not of me  and that cover with a cover  but not of my spirit  that they may add sin to sin  30  2 that walk to go down into egypt  and have not ask at my mouth  to strengthen themselv in the strength of pharaoh  and to trust in the shadow of egypt  30  3 therefor shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame  and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confus  30  4 for his princ were at zoan  and his ambassador came to hane  30  5 they were all asham of a peopl that could not profit them  nor be an help nor profit  but a shame  and also a reproach  30  6 the burden of the beast of the south  into the land of troubl and anguish  from whenc come the young and old lion  the viper and fieri fli serpent  they will carri their rich upon the shoulder of young ass  and their treasur upon the bunch of camel  to a peopl that shall not profit them  30  7 for the egyptian shall help in vain  and to no purpos  therefor have i cri concern this  their strength is to sit still  30  8 now go  write it befor them in a tabl  and note it in a book  that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever  30  9 that this is a rebelli peopl  lie children  children that will not hear the law of the lord  30  10 which say to the seer  see not  and to the prophet  prophesi not unto us right thing  speak unto us smooth thing  prophesi deceit  30  11 get you out of the way  turn asid out of the path  caus the holi one of israel to ceas from befor us  30  12 wherefor thus saith the holi one of israel  becaus ye despis this word  and trust in oppress and pervers  and stay thereon  30  13 therefor this iniqu shall be to you as a breach readi to fall  swell out in a high wall  whose break cometh sudden at an instant  30  14 and he shall break it as the break of the potter  vessel that is broken in piec  he shall not spare  so that there shall not be found in the burst of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth  or to take water withal out of the pit  30  15 for thus saith the lord god  the holi one of israel  in return and rest shall ye be save  in quiet and in confid shall be your strength  and ye would not  30  16 but ye said  no  for we will flee upon hors  therefor shall ye flee  and  we will ride upon the swift  therefor shall they that pursu you be swift  30  17 one thousand shall flee at the rebuk of one  at the rebuk of five shall ye flee  till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain  and as an ensign on an hill  30  18 and therefor will the lord wait  that he may be gracious unto you  and therefor will he be exalt  that he may have merci upon you  for the lord is a god of judgment  bless are all they that wait for him  30  19 for the peopl shall dwell in zion at jerusalem  thou shalt weep no more  he will be veri gracious unto thee at the voic of thi cri  when he shall hear it  he will answer thee  30  20 and though the lord give you the bread of advers  and the water of afflict  yet shall not thi teacher be remov into a corner ani more  but thine eye shall see thi teacher  30  21 and thine ear shall hear a word behind thee  say  this is the way  walk ye in it  when ye turn to the right hand  and when ye turn to the left  30  22 ye shall defil also the cover of thi graven imag of silver  and the ornament of thi molten imag of gold  thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth  thou shalt say unto it  get thee henc  30  23 then shall he give the rain of thi seed  that thou shalt sow the ground withal  and bread of the increas of the earth  and it shall be fat and plenteous  in that day shall thi cattl feed in larg pastur  30  24 the oxen likewis and the young ass that ear the ground shall eat clean provend  which hath been winnow with the shovel and with the fan  30  25 and there shall be upon everi high mountain  and upon everi high hill  river and stream of water in the day of the great slaughter  when the tower fall  30  26 moreov the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun  and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold  as the light of seven day  in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his peopl  and healeth the stroke of their wound  30  27 behold  the name of the lord cometh from far  burn with his anger  and the burden thereof is heavi  his lip are full of indign  and his tongu as a devour fire  30  28 and his breath  as an overflow stream  shall reach to the midst of the neck  to sift the nation with the siev of vaniti  and there shall be a bridl in the jaw of the peopl  caus them to err  30  29 ye shall have a song  as in the night when a holi solemn is kept  and glad of heart  as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord  to the mighti one of israel  30  30 and the lord shall caus his glorious voic to be heard  and shall shew the light down of his arm  with the indign of his anger  and with the flame of a devour fire  with scatter  and tempest  and hailston  30  31 for through the voic of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down  which smote with a rod  30  32 and in everi place where the ground staff shall pass  which the lord shall lay upon him  it shall be with tabret and harp  and in battl of shake will he fight with it  30  33 for tophet is ordain of old  yea  for the king it is prepar  he hath made it deep and larg  the pile thereof is fire and much wood  the breath of the lord  like a stream of brimston  doth kindl it  31  1 woe to them that go down to egypt for help  and stay on hors  and trust in chariot  becaus they are mani  and in horsemen  becaus they are veri strong  but they look not unto the holi one of israel  neither seek the lord  31  2 yet he also is wise  and will bring evil  and will not call back his word  but will aris against the hous of the evildo  and against the help of them that work iniqu  31  3 now the egyptian are men  and not god  and their hors flesh  and not spirit  when the lord shall stretch out his hand  both he that helpeth shall fall  and he that is holpen shall fall down  and they all shall fail togeth  31  4 for thus hath the lord spoken unto me  like as the lion and the young lion roar on his prey  when a multitud of shepherd is call forth against him  he will not be afraid of their voic  nor abas himself for the nois of them  so shall the lord of host come down to fight for mount zion  and for the hill thereof  31  5 as bird fli  so will the lord of host defend jerusalem  defend also he will deliv it  and pass over he will preserv it  31  6 turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deepli revolt  31  7 for in that day everi man shall cast away his idol of silver  and his idol of gold  which your own hand have made unto you for a sin  31  8 then shall the assyrian fall with the sword  not of a mighti man  and the sword  not of a mean man  shall devour him  but he shall flee from the sword  and his young men shall be discomfit  31  9 and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear  and his princ shall be afraid of the ensign  saith the lord  whose fire is in zion  and his furnac in jerusalem  32  1 behold  a king shall reign in righteous  and princ shall rule in judgment  32  2 and a man shall be as an hide place from the wind  and a covert from the tempest  as river of water in a dri place  as the shadow of a great rock in a weari land  32  3 and the eye of them that see shall not be dim  and the ear of them that hear shall hearken  32  4 the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledg  and the tongu of the stammer shall be readi to speak plain  32  5 the vile person shall be no more call liber  nor the churl said to be bounti  32  6 for the vile person will speak villani  and his heart will work iniqu  to practis hypocrisi  and to utter error against the lord  to make empti the soul of the hungri  and he will caus the drink of the thirsti to fail  32  7 the instrument also of the churl are evil  he deviseth wick devic to destroy the poor with lie word  even when the needi speaketh right  32  8 but the liber deviseth liber thing  and by liber thing shall he stand  32  9 rise up  ye women that are at eas  hear my voic  ye careless

troubl  ye careless one  strip you  and make you bare  and gird sackcloth upon your loin  32  12 they shall lament for the teat  for the pleasant field  for the fruit vine  32  13 upon the land of my peopl shall come up thorn and brier  yea  upon all the hous of joy in the joyous citi  32  14 becaus the palac shall be forsaken  the multitud of the citi shall be left  the fort and tower shall be for den for ever  a joy of wild ass  a pastur of flock  32  15 until the spirit be pour upon us from on high  and the wilder be a fruit field  and the fruit field be count for a forest  32  16 then judgment shall dwell in the wilder  and righteous remain in the fruit field  32  17 and the work of righteous shall be peac  and the effect of righteous quiet and assur for ever  32  18 and my peopl shall dwell in a peaceabl habit  and in sure dwell  and in quiet rest place  32  19 when it shall hail  come down on the forest  and the citi shall be low in a low place  32  20 bless are ye that sow besid all water  that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass  33  1 woe to thee that spoilest  and thou wast not spoil  and dealest treacher  and they dealt not treacher with thee  when thou shalt ceas to spoil  thou shalt be spoil  and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacher  they shall deal treacher with thee  33  2 o lord  be gracious unto us  we have wait for thee  be thou

wisdom and knowledg shall be the stabil of thi time  and strength of salvat  the fear of the lord is his treasur  33  7 behold  their valiant one shall cri without  the ambassador of peac shall weep

assyria came up against all the defenc citi of judah  and took them  36  2 and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great armi  and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller  s field  36  3 then came forth unto him eliakim  hilkiah  s son  which was over the hous  and shebna the scribe  and joah  asaph  s son  the record  36  4 and rabshakeh said unto them  say ye now to hezekiah  thus saith the great king  the king of assyria  what confid is this wherein thou trustest  36  5 i say  sayest thou   but they are but vain word  i have counsel and strength for war  now on whom dost thou trust  that thou rebellest against me  36  6 lo  thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed  on egypt  whereon if a man lean  it will go into his hand  and pierc it  so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him  36  7 but if thou say to me  we trust in the lord our god  is it not he  whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away  and said to judah and to jerusalem  ye shall worship befor this altar  36  8 now therefor give pledg  i pray thee  to my master the king of assyria  and i will give thee two thousand hors  if thou be abl on thi part to set rider upon them  36  9 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master  s servant  and put thi trust on egypt for chariot and for horsemen  36  10 and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it  the lord said unto me  go up against this land  and destroy it  36  11 then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh  speak  i pray thee  unto thi servant in the syrian languag  for we understand it  and speak not to us in the jew  languag  in the ear of the peopl that are on the wall  36  12 but rabshakeh said  hath my master sent me to thi master and to thee to speak these word  hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall  that they may eat their own dung  and drink their own piss with you  36  13 then rabshakeh stood  and cri with a loud voic in the jew  languag  and said  hear ye the word of the great king  the king of assyria  36  14 thus saith the king  let not hezekiah deceiv you  for he shall not be abl to deliv you  36  15 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord  say  the lord will sure deliv us  this citi shall not be deliv into the hand of the king of assyria  36  16 hearken not to hezekiah  for thus saith the king of assyria  make an agreement with me by a present  and come out to me  and eat ye everi one of his vine  and everi one of his fig tree  and drink ye everi one the water of his own cistern  36  17 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land  a land of corn and wine  a land of bread and vineyard  36  18 bewar lest hezekiah persuad you  say  the lord will deliv us  hath ani of the god of the nation deliv his land out of the hand of the king of assyria  36  19 where are the god of hamath and arphad  where are the god of sepharvaim  and have they deliv samaria out of my hand  36  20 who are they among all the god of these land  that have deliv their land out of my hand  that the lord should deliv jerusalem out of my hand  36  21 but they held their peac  and answer him not a word  for the king  s command was  say  answer him not  36  22 then came eliakim  the son of hilkiah  that was over the household  and shebna the scribe  and joah  the son of asaph  the record  to hezekiah with their cloth rent  and told him the word of rabshakeh  37  1 and it came to pass  when king hezekiah heard it  that he rent his cloth  and cover himself with sackcloth  and went into the hous of the lord  37  2 and he sent eliakim  who was over the household  and shebna the scribe  and the elder of the priest cover with sackcloth  unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz  37  3 and they said unto him  thus saith hezekiah  this day is a day of troubl  and of rebuk  and of blasphemi  for the children are come to the birth  and there is not strength to bring forth  37  4 it may be the lord thi god will hear the word of rabshakeh  whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the live god  and will reprov the word which the lord thi god hath heard  wherefor lift up thi prayer for the remnant that is left  37  5 so the servant of king hezekiah came to isaiah  37  6 and isaiah said unto them  thus shall ye say unto your master  thus saith the lord  be not afraid of the word that thou hast heard  wherewith the servant of the king of assyria have blasphem me  37  7 behold  i will send a blast upon him  and he shall hear a rumour  and return to his own land  and i will caus him to fall by the sword in his own land  37  8 so rabshakeh return  and found the king of assyria war against libnah  for he had heard that he was depart from lachish  37  9 and he heard say concern tirhakah king of ethiopia  he is come forth to make war with thee  and when he heard it  he sent messeng to hezekiah  say  37  10 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah  say  let not thi god  in whom thou trustest  deceiv thee  say  jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria  37  11 behold  thou hast heard what the king of assyria have done to all land by destroy them utter  and shalt thou be deliv  37  12 have the god of the nation deliv them which my father have destroy  as gozan  and haran  and rezeph  and the children of eden which were in telassar  37  13 where is the king of hamath  and the king of arphad  and the king of the citi of sepharvaim  hena  and ivah  37  14 and hezekiah receiv the letter from the hand of the messeng  and read it  and hezekiah went up unto the hous of the lord  and spread it befor the lord  37  15 and hezekiah pray unto the lord  say  37  16 o lord of host  god of israel  that dwellest between the cherubim  thou art the god  even thou alon  of all the kingdom of the earth  thou hast made heaven and earth  37  17 inclin thine ear  o lord  and hear  open thine eye  o lord  and see  and hear all the word of sennacherib  which hath sent to reproach the live god  37  18 of a truth  lord  the king of assyria have laid wast all the nation  and their countri  37  19 and have cast their god into the fire  for they were no god  but the work of men  s hand  wood and stone  therefor they have destroy them  37  20 now therefor  o lord our god  save us from his hand  that all the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord  even thou onli  37  21 then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah  say  thus saith the lord god of israel  wherea thou hast pray to me against sennacherib king of assyria  37  22 this is the word which the lord hath spoken concern him  the virgin  the daughter of zion  hath despis thee  and laugh thee to scorn  the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee  37  23 whom hast thou reproach and blasphem  and against whom hast thou exalt thi voic  and lift up thine eye on high  even against the holi one of israel  37  24 by thi servant hast thou reproach the lord  and hast said  by the multitud of my chariot am i come up to the height of the mountain  to the side of lebanon  and i will cut down the tall cedar thereof  and the choic fir tree thereof  and i will enter into the height of his border  and the forest of his carmel  37  25 i have dig  and drunk water  and with the sole of my feet have i dri up all the river of the besieg place  37  26 hast thou not heard long ago  how i have done it  and of ancient time  that i have form it  now have i brought it to pass  that thou shouldest be to lay wast defenc citi into ruinous heap  37  27 therefor their inhabit were of small power  they were dismay and confound  they were as the grass of the field  and as the green herb  as the grass on the housetop  and as corn blast befor it be grown up  37  28 but i know thi abod  and thi go out  and thi come in  and thi rage against me  37  29 becaus thi rage against me  and thi tumult  is come up into mine ear  therefor will i put my hook in thi nose  and my bridl in thi lip  and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest  37  30 and this shall be a sign unto thee  ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself  and the second year that which springeth of the same  and in the third year sow ye  and reap  and plant vineyard  and eat the fruit thereof  37  31 and the remnant that is escap of the hous of judah shall again take root downward  and bear fruit upward  37  32 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant  and they that escap out of mount zion  the zeal of the lord of host shall do this  37  33 therefor thus saith the lord concern the king of assyria  he shall not come into this citi  nor shoot an arrow there  nor come befor it with shield  nor cast a bank against it  37  34 by the way that he came  by the same shall he return  and shall not come into this citi  saith the lord  37  35 for i will defend this citi to save it for mine own sake  and for my servant david  s sake  37  36 then the angel of the lord went forth  and smote in the camp of the assyrian a hundr and fourscor and five thousand  and when they aros earli in the morn  behold  they were all dead corps  37  37 so sennacherib king of assyria depart  and went and return  and dwelt at nineveh  37  38 and it came to pass  as he was worship in the hous of nisroch his god  that adrammelech and sharez his son smote him with the sword  and they escap into the land of armenia  and esarhaddon his son reign in his stead  38  1 in those day was hezekiah sick unto death  and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him  and said unto him  thus saith the lord  set thine hous in order  for thou shalt die  and not live  38  2 then hezekiah turn his face toward the wall  and pray unto the lord  38  3 and said  rememb now  o lord  i beseech thee  how i have walk befor thee in truth and with a perfect heart  and have done that which is good in thi sight  and hezekiah wept sore  38  4 then came the word of the lord to isaiah  say  38  5 go  and say to hezekiah  thus saith the lord  the god of david thi father  i have heard thi prayer  i have seen thi tear  behold

to the string instrument all the day of our life in the hous of the lord  38  21 for isaiah had said  let them take a lump of fig  and lay it for a plaister upon the boil  and he shall recov  38  22 hezekiah also had said  what is the sign that i shall go up to the hous of the lord  39  1 at that time merodachbaladan  the son of baladan  king of babylon  sent letter and a present to hezekiah  for

and come unto me  hear  and your soul shall live  and i will make an everlast coven with you  even the sure merci of david  55  4 behold  i have given him for a wit to the peopl  a leader and command to the peopl  55  5 behold  thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not  and nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee becaus of the lord thi god  and for the holi one of israel  for he hath glorifi thee  55  6 seek ye the lord while he may be found  call ye upon him while he is near  55  7 let the wick forsak his way  and the unright man his thought  and let him return unto the lord  and he will have merci upon him  and to our god  for he will abund pardon  55  8 for my thought are not your thought  neither are your way my way  saith the lord  55  9 for as the heaven are higher than the earth  so are my way higher than your way  and my thought than your thought  55  10 for as the rain cometh down  and the snow from heaven  and returneth not thither  but watereth the earth  and maketh it bring forth and bud  that it may give seed to the sower  and bread to the eater  55  11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth  it shall not return unto me void  but it shall

bless is the man that doeth this  and the son of man that layeth hold on it  that keepeth the sabbath from pollut it  and keepeth his hand from do ani evil  56  3 neither let the son of the stranger  that hath join himself to the lord  speak  say  the lord hath utter separ me from his peopl  neither let the eunuch say  behold  i am a dri tree  56  4 for thus saith the lord unto the eunuch that keep my sabbath  and choos the thing that pleas me  and take hold of my coven  56  5 even unto them will i give in mine hous and within my wall a place and a name better than of son and of daughter  i will give them an everlast name  that shall not be cut off  56  6 also the son of the stranger  that join themselv to the lord  to serv him  and to love the name of the lord  to be his servant  everi one that keepeth the sabbath from pollut it  and taketh hold of my coven  56  7 even them will i bring to my holi mountain  and make them joy in my hous of prayer  their burnt offer and their sacrific

and no man layeth it to heart  and merci men are taken away  none consid that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come  57  2 he shall enter into peac  they shall rest in their bed  each one walk in his upright  57  3 but draw near hither  ye son of the sorceress  the seed of the adulter and the whore  57  4 against whom do ye sport yourselv  against whom make ye a wide mouth  and draw out the tongu  are ye not children of transgress  a seed of falsehood  57  5 enflam yourselv with idol under everi green tree  slay the children in the valley under the clift of the rock  57  6 among the smooth stone of the stream is thi portion  they  they are thi lot  even to them hast thou pour a drink offer  thou hast offer a meat offer  should i receiv comfort in these  57  7 upon a lofti and high mountain hast thou set thi bed  even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrific  57  8 behind the door also and the post hast thou set up thi remembr  for thou hast discov thyself to anoth than me  and art gone up  thou hast enlarg thi bed  and made thee a coven with them  thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it  57  9 and thou wentest to the king with ointment  and didst increas thi perfum  and didst send thi messeng far off  and didst debas thyself even unto hell  57  10 thou art weari in the great of thi way  yet saidst thou not  there is no hope  thou hast found the life of thine hand  therefor thou wast not griev  57  11 and of whom hast thou been afraid or fear  that thou hast lie  and hast not rememb me  nor laid it to thi heart  have not i held my peac even of old  and thou fearest me not  57  12 i will declar thi righteous  and thi work  for they shall not profit thee  57  13 when thou criest  let thi compani deliv thee  but the wind shall carri them all away  vaniti shall take them  but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land  and shall inherit my holi mountain  57  14 and shall say  cast ye up  cast ye up  prepar the way  take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my peopl  57  15 for thus saith the high and lofti one that inhabiteth etern  whose name is holi  i dwell in the high and holi place  with him also that is of a contrit and humbl spirit  to reviv the spirit of the humbl  and to reviv the heart of the contrit one  57  16 for i will not contend for ever  neither will i be alway wroth  for the spirit should fail befor me  and the soul which i have made  57  17 for the iniqu of his covet was i wroth  and smote him  i hid me  and was wroth  and he went on froward in the way of his heart  57  18 i have seen his way  and will heal him  i will lead him also  and restor comfort unto him and to his mourner  57  19 i creat the fruit of the lip  peac  peac to him that is far off  and to him that is near  saith the lord  and i will heal him  57  20 but the wick are like the troubl sea  when it cannot rest  whose water cast up mire and dirt  57  21 there is no peac  saith my god  to the wick  58  1 cri aloud  spare not  lift up thi voic like a trumpet  and shew my peopl their transgress  and the hous of jacob their sin  58  2 yet they seek me daili  and delight to know my way  as a nation that did righteous  and forsook not the ordin of their god  they ask of me the ordin of justic  they take delight in approach to god  58  3 wherefor have we fast  say they  and thou seest not  wherefor have we afflict our soul  and thou takest no knowledg  behold  in the day of your fast ye find pleasur  and exact all your labour  58  4 behold  ye fast for strife and debat  and to smite with the fist of wicked  ye shall not fast as ye do this day  to make your voic to be heard on high  58  5 is it such a fast that i have chosen  a day for a man to afflict his soul  is it to bow down his head as a bulrush  and to spread sackcloth and ash under him  wilt thou call this a fast  and an accept day to the lord  58  6 is not this the fast that i have chosen  to loos the band of wicked  to undo the heavi burden  and to let the oppress go free  and that ye break everi yoke  58  7 is it not to deal thi bread to the hungri  and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thi hous  when thou seest the nake  that thou cover him  and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh  58  8 then shall thi light break forth as the morn  and thine health shall spring forth speedili  and thi righteous shall go befor thee  the glori of the lord shall be thi rereward  58  9 then shalt thou call  and the lord shall answer  thou shalt cri  and he shall say  here i am  if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke  the put forth of the finger  and speak vaniti  58  10 and if thou draw out thi soul to the hungri  and satisfi the afflict soul  then shall thi light rise in obscur  and thi dark be as the noon day  58  11 and the lord shall guid thee continu  and satisfi thi soul in drought  and make fat thi bone  and thou shalt be like a water garden  and like a spring of water  whose water fail not  58  12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old wast place  thou shalt rais up the foundat of mani generat  and thou shalt be call  the repair of the breach  the restor of path to dwell in  58  13 if thou turn away thi foot from the sabbath  from do thi pleasur on my holi day  and call the sabbath a delight  the holi of the lord  honour  and shalt honour him  not do thine own way  nor find thine own pleasur  nor speak thine own word  58  14 then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord  and i will caus thee to ride upon the high place of the earth  and feed thee with the heritag of jacob thi father  for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it  59  1 behold  the lord  s hand is not shorten  that it cannot save  neither his ear heavi  that it cannot hear  59  2 but your iniqu have separ between you and your god  and your sin have hid his face from you  that he will not hear  59  3 for your hand are defil with blood  and your finger with iniqu  your lip have spoken lie  your tongu hath mutter pervers  59  4 none calleth for justic  nor ani pleadeth for truth  they trust in vaniti  and speak lie  they conceiv mischief  and bring forth iniqu  59  5 they hatch cockatric  egg  and weav the spider  s web  he that eateth of their egg dieth  and that which is crush breaketh out into a viper  59  6 their web shall not becom garment  neither shall they cover themselv with their work  their work are work of iniqu  and the act of violenc is in their hand  59  7 their feet run to evil  and they make hast to shed innoc blood  their thought are thought of iniqu  wast and destruct are in their path  59  8 the way of peac they know not  and there is no judgment in their go  they have made them crook path  whosoev goeth therein shall not know peac  59  9 therefor is judgment far from us  neither doth justic overtak us  we wait for light  but behold obscur  for bright  but we walk in dark  59  10 we grope for the wall like the blind  and we grope as if we had no eye  we stumbl at noon day as in the night  we are in desol place as dead men  59  11 we roar all like bear  and mourn sore like dove  we look for judgment  but there is none  for salvat  but it is far off from us  59  12 for our transgress are multipli befor thee  and our sin testifi against us  for our transgress are with us  and as for our iniqu  we know them  59  13 in transgress and lie against the lord  and depart away from our god  speak oppress and revolt  conceiv and utter from the heart word of falsehood  59  14 and judgment is turn away backward  and justic standeth afar off  for truth is fallen in the street  and equiti cannot enter  59  15 yea  truth faileth  and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey  and the lord saw it  and it displeas him that there was no judgment  59  16 and he saw that there was no man  and wonder that there was no intercessor  therefor his arm brought salvat unto him  and his righteous  it sustain him  59  17 for he put on righteous as a breastplat  and an helmet of salvat upon his head  and he put on the garment of vengeanc for cloth  and was clad with zeal as a cloak  59  18 accord to their deed  accord he will repay  furi to his adversari  recomp to his enemi  to the island he will repay recomp  59  19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west  and his glori from the rise of the sun  when the enemi shall come in like a flood  the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him  59  20 and the redeem shall come to zion  and unto them that turn from transgress in jacob  saith the lord  59  21 as for me  this is my coven with them  saith the lord  my spirit that is upon thee  and my word which i have put in thi mouth  shall not depart out of thi mouth  nor out of the mouth of thi seed  nor out of the mouth of thi seed  s seed  saith the lord  from henceforth and for ever  60  1 aris  shine  for thi light is come  and the glori of the lord is risen upon thee  60  2 for  behold  the dark shall cover the earth  and gross dark the peopl  but the lord shall aris upon thee  and his glori shall be seen upon thee  60  3 and the gentil shall come to thi light  and king to

the lord thi god  and to the holi one of israel  becaus he hath glorifi thee  60  10 and the son of stranger shall build up thi wall  and their king shall minist unto thee  for in my wrath i smote thee  but in my favour have i had merci on thee  60  11 therefor thi gate shall be open continu  they shall not be shut day nor night  that men may bring unto thee the forc of the gentil  and that their king may be brought  60  12 for the nation and kingdom that will not serv thee shall perish  yea  those nation shall be utter wast  60  13 the glori of lebanon shall come unto thee  the fir tree  the pine tree  and the box togeth  to beautifi the place of my sanctuari  and i will make the place of my feet glorious  60  14 the son also of them that afflict thee shall come bend unto thee  and all they that despis thee shall bow themselv down at the sole of thi feet  and they shall call thee  the citi of the lord  the zion of the holi one of israel  60  15 wherea thou has been forsaken and hate  so that no man went through thee  i will make thee an etern excel  a joy of mani generat  60  16 thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentil  and shalt suck the breast of king  and thou shalt

priest shall be astonish  and the prophet shall wonder  4  10 then said i  ah  lord god  sure thou hast great deceiv this peopl and jerusalem  say  ye shall have peac  wherea the sword reacheth unto the soul  4  11 at that time shall it be said to this peopl and to jerusalem  a dri wind of the high place in the wilder toward the daughter of my peopl  not to fan  nor to cleans  4  12 even a full wind from those place shall come unto me  now also will i give sentenc against them  4  13 behold  he shall come up as cloud  and his chariot shall be as a whirlwind  his hors are swifter than eagl  woe unto us  for we are spoil  4  14 o jerusalem  wash thine heart from wicked  that thou mayest be save  how long shall thi vain thought lodg within thee  4  15 for a voic declareth from dan  and

4  17 as keeper of a field  are they against her round about  becaus she hath been rebelli against me  saith the lord  4  18 thi way and thi do have procur these thing unto thee  this is thi wicked  becaus it is bitter  becaus it reacheth unto thine heart  4  19 my bowel  my bowel  i am pain at my veri heart  my heart maketh a nois in me  i cannot hold my peac  becaus thou hast heard  o my soul  the sound of the trumpet  the alarm of war  4  20 destruct upon destruct is cri  for the whole land is spoil  sudden are my tent spoil  and my curtain in a moment  4  21 how long shall i see the standard  and hear the sound of the trumpet  4  22 for my peopl is foolish  they have not known me  they are sottish children  and they have none understand  they are wise to do evil  but to do good they have no knowledg  4  23 i beheld the earth  and  lo  it was without form  and void  and the heaven  and they had no light  4  24 i beheld the mountain  and  lo  they trembl  and all the hill move light  4  25 i beheld  and  lo  there was no man  and all the bird of the heaven were fled  4  26 i beheld  and  lo  the fruit place was a wilder  and all the citi thereof were broken down at the presenc of the lord  and by his fierc anger  4  27 for thus hath the lord said  the whole land shall be desol  yet will i not make a full end  4  28 for this shall the earth mourn  and the heaven abov be black  becaus i have spoken it  i have purpos it  and will not repent  neither will i turn back from it  4  29 the whole citi shall flee for the nois of the horsemen and bowmen  they shall go into thicket  and climb up upon the rock  everi citi shall be forsaken  and not a man dwell therein  4  30 and when thou art spoil  what wilt thou do  though thou clothest thyself with crimson  though thou deckest thee with ornament of gold  though thou rentest thi face with paint  in vain shalt thou make thyself fair  thi lover will despis thee  they will seek thi life  4  31 for i have heard a voic as of a woman in travail  and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child  the voic of the daughter of zion  that bewaileth herself  that spreadeth her hand  say  woe is me now  for my soul is weari becaus of murder  5  1 run ye to and fro through the street of jerusalem  and see now  and know  and seek in the broad place thereof  if ye can find a man  if there be ani that executeth judgment  that seeketh the truth  and i will pardon it  5  2 and though they say  the lord liveth  sure they swear fals  5  3 o lord  are not thine eye upon the truth  thou hast stricken them  but they have not griev  thou hast consum them  but they have refus to receiv correct  they have made their face harder than a rock  they have refus to return  5  4 therefor i said  sure these are poor  they are foolish  for they know not the way of the lord  nor the judgment of their god  5  5 i will get me unto the great men  and will speak unto them  for they have known the way of the lord  and the judgment of their god  but these have altogeth broken the yoke  and burst the bond  5  6 wherefor a lion out of the forest shall slay them  and a wolf of the even shall spoil them  a leopard shall watch over their citi  everi one that goeth out thenc shall be torn in piec  becaus their transgress are mani  and their backslid are increas  5  7 how shall i pardon thee for this  thi children have forsaken me  and sworn by them that are no god  when i had fed them to the full  they then commit adulteri  and assembl themselv by troop in the harlot  hous  5  8 they were as fed hors in the morn  everi one neigh after his neighbour  s wife  5  9 shall i not visit for these thing  saith the lord  and shall not my soul be aveng on such a nation as this  5  10 go ye up upon her wall  and destroy  but make not a full end  take away her battlement  for they are not the lord  s  5  11 for the hous of israel and the hous of judah have dealt veri treacher against me  saith the lord  5  12 they have beli the lord  and said  it is not he  neither shall evil come upon us  neither shall we see sword nor famin  5  13 and the prophet shall becom wind  and the word is not in them  thus shall it be done unto them  5  14 wherefor thus saith the lord god of host  becaus ye speak this word  behold  i will make my word in thi mouth fire  and this peopl wood  and it shall devour them  5  15 lo  i will bring a nation upon you from far  o hous of israel  saith the lord  it is a mighti nation  it is an ancient nation  a nation whose languag thou knowest not  neither understandest what they say  5  16 their quiver is as an open sepulchr  they are all mighti men  5  17 and they shall eat up thine harvest  and thi bread  which thi son and thi daughter should eat  they shall eat up thi flock and thine herd  they shall eat up thi vine and thi fig tree  they shall impoverish thi fenc citi  wherein thou trustedst  with the sword  5  18 nevertheless in those day  saith the lord  i will not make a full end with you  5  19 and it shall come to pass  when ye shall say  wherefor doeth the lord our god all these thing unto us  then shalt thou answer them  like as ye have forsaken me  and serv strang god in your land  so shall ye serv stranger in a land that is not your  s  5  20 declar this in the hous of jacob  and publish it in judah  say  5  21 hear now this  o foolish peopl  and without understand  which have eye  and see not  which have ear  and hear not  5  22 fear ye not me  saith the lord  will ye not trembl at my presenc  which have place the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetu decre  that it cannot pass it  and though the wave thereof toss themselv  yet can they not prevail  though they roar  yet can they not pass over it  5  23 but this peopl hath a revolt and a rebelli heart  they are revolt and gone  5  24 neither say they in their heart  let us now fear the lord our god  that giveth rain  both the former and the latter  in his season  he reserveth unto us the appoint week of the harvest  5  25 your iniqu have turn away these thing  and your sin have withholden good thing from you  5  26 for among my peopl are found wick men  they lay wait  as he that setteth snare  they set a trap  they catch men  5  27 as a cage is full of bird  so are their hous full of deceit  therefor they are becom great  and waxen rich  5  28 they are waxen fat  they shine  yea  they overpass the deed of the wick  they judg not the caus  the caus of the fatherless  yet they prosper  and the right of the needi do they not judg  5  29 shall i not visit for these thing  saith the lord  shall not my soul be aveng on such a nation as this  5  30 a wonder and horribl thing is commit in the land  5  31 the prophet prophesi fals  and the priest bear rule by their mean  and my peopl love to have it so  and what will ye do in the end thereof  6  1 o ye children of benjamin  gather yourselv to flee out of the midst of jerusalem  and blow the trumpet in tekoa  and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem  for evil appeareth out of the north  and great destruct  6  2 i have liken the daughter of zion to a come and delic woman  6  3 the shepherd with their flock shall come unto her  they shall pitch their tent against her round about  they shall feed everi one in his place  6  4 prepar ye war against her  aris  and let us go up at noon  woe unto us  for the day goeth away  for the shadow of the even are stretch out  6  5 aris  and let us go by night  and let us destroy her palac  6  6 for thus hath the lord of host said  hew ye down tree  and cast a mount against jerusalem  this is the citi to be visit  she is wholli oppress in the midst of her  6  7 as a fountain casteth out her water  so she casteth out her wicked  violenc and spoil is heard in her  befor me continu is grief and wound  6  8 be thou instruct  o jerusalem  lest my soul depart from thee  lest i make thee desol  a land not inhabit  6  9 thus saith the lord of host  they shall through glean the remnant of israel as a vine  turn back thine hand as a grapegather into the basket  6  10 to whom shall i speak  and give warn  that they may hear  behold  their ear is uncircumcis  and they cannot hearken  behold  the word of the lord is unto them a reproach  they have no delight in it  6  11 therefor i am full of the furi of the lord  i am weari with hold in  i will pour it out upon the children abroad  and upon the assembl of young men togeth  for even the husband with the wife shall be taken  the age with him that is full of day  6  12 and their hous shall be turn unto other  with their field and wive togeth  for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabit of the land  saith the lord  6  13 for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everi one is given to covet  and from the prophet even unto the priest everi one dealeth fals  6  14 they have heal also the hurt of the daughter of my peopl slight  say  peac  peac  when there is no peac  6  15 were they asham when they had commit abomin  nay  they were not at all asham  neither could they blush  therefor they shall fall among them that fall  at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down  saith the lord  6  16 thus saith the lord  stand ye in the way  and see  and ask for the old path  where is the good way  and walk therein  and ye shall find rest for your soul  but they said  we will not walk therein  6  17 also i set watchmen over you  say  hearken to the sound of the trumpet  but they said  we will not hearken  6  18 therefor hear  ye nation  and know  o congreg  what is among them  6  19 hear  o earth  behold  i will bring evil upon this peopl  even the fruit of their thought  becaus they have not hearken unto my word  nor to my law  but reject it  6  20 to what purpos cometh there to me incens from sheba  and the sweet cane from a far countri  your burnt offer are not accept  nor your sacrific sweet unto me  6  21 therefor thus saith the lord  behold  i will lay stumblingblock befor this peopl  and the father and the son togeth shall fall upon them  the neighbour and his friend shall perish  6  22 thus saith the lord  behold  a peopl cometh from the north countri  and a great nation shall be rais from the side of the earth  6  23 they shall lay hold on bow and spear  they are cruel  and have no merci  their voic roareth like the sea  and they ride upon hors  set in array as men for war against thee  o daughter of zion  6  24 we have heard the fame thereof  our hand wax feebl  anguish hath taken hold of us  and pain  as of a woman in travail  6  25 go not forth into the field  nor walk by the way  for the sword of the enemi and fear is on everi side  6  26 o daughter of my peopl  gird thee with sackcloth  and wallow thyself in ash  make thee mourn  as for an onli son  most bitter lament  for the spoiler shall sudden come upon us  6  27 i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my peopl  that thou mayest know and tri their way  6  28 they are all grievous revolt  walk with slander  they are brass and iron  they are all corrupt  6  29 the bellow are burn  the lead is consum of the fire  the founder melteth in vain  for the wick are not pluck away  6  30 reprob silver shall men call them  becaus the lord hath reject them  7  1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  say  7  2 stand in the gate of the lord  s hous  and proclaim there this word  and say  hear the word of the lord  all ye of judah  that enter in at these gate to worship the lord  7  3 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  amend your way and your do  and i will caus you to dwell in this place  7  4 trust ye not in lie word  say  the templ of the lord  the templ of the lord  the templ of the lord  are these  7  5 for if ye through amend your way and your do  if ye through execut judgment between a man and his neighbour  7  6 if ye oppress not the stranger  the fatherless  and the widow  and shed not innoc blood in this place  neither walk after other god to your hurt  7  7 then will i caus you to dwell in this place  in the land that i gave to your father  for ever and ever  7  8 behold  ye trust in lie word  that cannot profit  7  9 will ye steal  murder  and commit adulteri  and swear fals  and burn incens unto baal  and walk after other god whom ye know not  7  10 and come and stand befor me in this hous  which is call by my name  and say  we are deliv to do all these abomin  7  11 is this hous  which is call by my name  becom a den of robber in your eye  behold  even i have seen it  saith the lord  7  12 but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh  where i set my name at the first  and see what i did to it for the wicked of my peopl israel  7  13 and now  becaus ye have done all these work  saith the lord  and i spake unto you  rise up earli and speak  but ye heard not  and i call you  but ye answer not  7  14 therefor will i do unto this hous  which is call by my name  wherein ye trust  and unto the place which i gave to you and to your father  as i have done to shiloh  7  15 and i will cast you out of my sight  as i have cast out all your brethren  even the whole seed of ephraim  7  16 therefor pray not thou for this peopl  neither lift up cri nor prayer for them  neither make intercess to me  for i will not hear thee  7  17 seest thou not what they do in the citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem  7  18 the children gather wood  and the father kindl the fire  and the women knead their dough  to make cake to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offer unto other god  that they may provok me to anger  7  19 do they provok me to anger  saith the lord  do they not provok themselv to the confus of their own face  7  20 therefor thus saith the lord god  behold  mine anger and my furi shall be pour out upon this place  upon man  and upon beast  and upon the tree of the field  and upon the fruit of the ground  and it shall burn  and shall not be quench  7  21 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  put your burnt offer unto your sacrific  and eat flesh  7  22 for i spake not unto your father  nor command them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt  concern burnt offer or sacrific  7  23 but this thing command i them  say  obey my voic  and i will be your god  and ye shall be my peopl  and walk ye in all the way that i have command you  that it may be well unto you  7  24 but they hearken not  nor inclin their ear  but walk in the counsel and in the imagin of their evil heart  and went backward  and not forward  7  25 sinc the day that your father came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servant the prophet  daili rise up earli and send them  7  26 yet they hearken not unto me  nor inclin their ear  but harden their neck  they did wors than their father  7  27 therefor thou shalt speak all these word unto them  but they will not hearken to thee  thou shalt also call unto them  but they will not answer thee  7  28 but thou shalt say unto them  this is a nation that obeyeth not the voic of the lord their god  nor receiveth correct  truth is perish  and is cut off from their mouth  7  29 cut off thine hair  o jerusalem  and cast it away  and take up a lament on high place  for the lord hath reject and forsaken the generat of his wrath  7  30 for the children of judah have done evil in my sight  saith the lord  they have set their abomin in the hous which is call by my name  to pollut it  7  31 and they have built the high place of tophet  which is in the valley of the son of hinnom  to burn their son and their daughter in the fire  which i command them not  neither came it into my heart  7  32 therefor  behold  the day come  saith the lord  that it shall no more be call tophet  nor the valley of the son of hinnom  but the valley of slaughter  for they shall buri in tophet  till there be no place  7  33 and the carcas of this peopl shall be meat for the fowl of the heaven  and for the beast of the earth  and none shall fray them away  7  34 then will i caus to ceas from the citi of judah  and from the street of jerusalem  the voic of mirth  and the voic of glad  the voic of the bridegroom  and the voic of the bride  for the land shall be desol  8  1 at that time  saith the lord  they shall bring out the bone of the king of judah  and the bone of his princ  and the bone of the priest  and the bone of the prophet  and the bone of the inhabit of jerusalem  out of their grave  8  2 and they shall spread them befor the sun  and the moon  and all the host of heaven  whom they have love  and whom they have serv  and after whom they have walk  and whom they have sought  and whom they have worship  they shall not be gather  nor be buri  they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth  8  3 and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residu of them that remain of this evil famili  which remain in all the place whither i have driven them  saith the lord of host  8  4 moreov thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord  shall they fall  and not aris  shall he turn away  and not return  8  5 whi then is this peopl of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetu backslid  they hold fast deceit  they refus to return  8  6 i hearken and heard  but they spake not aright  no man repent him of his wicked  say  what have i done  everi one turn to his cours  as the hors rusheth into the battl  8  7 yea  the stork in the heaven knoweth her appoint time  and the turtl and the crane and the swallow observ the time of their come  but my peopl know not the judgment of the lord  8  8 how do ye say  we are wise  and the law of the lord is with us  lo  certain in vain made he it  the pen of the scribe is in vain  8  9 the wise men are asham  they are dismay and taken  lo  they have reject the word of the lord  and what wisdom is in them  8  10 therefor will i give their wive unto other  and their field to them that shall inherit them  for everi one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covet  from the prophet even unto the priest everi one dealeth fals  8  11 for they have heal the hurt of the daughter of my peopl slight  say  peac  peac  when there is no peac  8  12 were they asham when they had commit abomin  nay  they were not at all asham  neither could they blush  therefor shall they fall among them that fall  in the time of their visit they shall be cast down  saith the lord  8  13 i will sure consum them  saith the lord  there shall be no grape on the vine  nor fig on the fig tree  and the leaf shall fade  and the thing that i have given them shall pass away from them  8  14 whi do we sit still  assembl yourselv  and let us enter into the defenc citi  and let us be silent there  for the lord our god hath put us to silenc  and given us water of gall to drink  becaus we have sin against the lord  8  15 we look for peac  but no good came  and for a time of health  and behold troubl  8  16 the snort of his hors was heard from dan  the whole land trembl at the sound of the neigh of his strong one  for they are come  and have devour the land  and all that is in it  the citi  and those that dwell therein  8  17 for  behold  i will send serpent  cockatric  among you  which will not be charm  and they shall bite you  saith the lord  8  18 when i would comfort myself against sorrow  my heart is faint in me  8  19 behold the voic of the cri of the daughter of my peopl becaus of them that dwell in a far countri  is not the lord in zion  is not her king in her  whi have they provok me to anger with their graven imag  and with strang vaniti  8  20 the harvest is past  the summer is end  and we are not save  8  21 for the hurt of the daughter of my peopl am i hurt  i am black  astonish hath taken hold on me  8  22 is there no balm in gilead  is there no physician there  whi then is not the health of the daughter of my peopl recov  9  1 oh that my head were water  and mine eye a fountain of tear  that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my peopl  9  2 oh that i had in the wilder a lodg place of wayfar men  that i might leav my peopl  and go from them  for they be all adulter  an assembl of treacher men  9  3 and they bend their tongu like their bow for lie  but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth  for they proceed from evil to evil  and they know not me  saith the lord  9  4 take ye heed everi one of his neighbour  and trust ye not in ani brother  for everi brother will utter supplant  and everi neighbour will walk with slander  9  5 and they will deceiv everi one his neighbour  and will not speak the truth  they have taught their tongu to speak lie  and weari themselv to commit iniqu  9  6 thine habit is in the midst of deceit  through deceit they refus to know me  saith the lord  9  7 therefor thus saith the lord of host  behold  i will melt them  and tri them  for how shall i do for the daughter of my peopl  9  8 their tongu is as an arrow shot out  it speaketh deceit  one speaketh peaceabl to his neighbour with his mouth  but in heart he layeth his wait  9  9 shall i not visit them for these thing  saith the lord  shall not my soul be aveng on such a nation as this  9  10 for the mountain will i take up a weep and wail  and for the habit of the wilder a lament  becaus they are burn up  so that none can pass through them  neither can men hear the voic of the cattl  both the fowl of the heaven and the beast are fled  they are gone  9  11 and i will make jerusalem heap  and a den of dragon  and i will make the citi of judah desol  without an inhabit  9  12 who is the wise man  that may understand this  and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken  that he may declar it  for what the land perisheth and is burn up like a wilder  that none passeth through  9  13 and the lord saith  becaus they have forsaken my law which i set befor them  and have not obey my voic  neither walk therein  9  14 but have walk after the imagin of their own heart  and after baalim  which their father taught them  9  15 therefor thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will feed them  even this peopl  with wormwood  and give them water of gall to drink  9  16 i will scatter them also among the heathen  whom neither they nor their father have known  and i will send a sword after them  till i have consum them  9  17 thus saith the lord of host  consid ye  and call for the mourn women  that they may come  and send for cun women  that they may come  9  18 and let them make hast  and take up a wail for us  that our eye may run down with tear  and our eyelid gush out with water  9  19 for a voic of wail is heard out of zion  how are we spoil  we are great confound  becaus we have forsaken the land  becaus our dwell have cast us out  9  20 yet hear the word of the lord  o ye women  and let your ear receiv the word of his mouth  and teach your daughter wail  and everi one her neighbour lament  9  21 for death is come up into our window  and is enter into our palac  to cut off the children from without  and the young men from the street  9  22 speak  thus saith the lord  even the carcas of men shall fall as dung upon the open field  and as the hand after the harvestman  and none shall gather them  9  23 thus saith the lord  let not the wise man glori in his wisdom  neither let the mighti man glori in his might  let not the rich man glori in his rich  9  24 but let him that glorieth glori in this  that he understandeth and knoweth me  that i am the lord which exercis lovingkind  judgment  and righteous  in the earth  for in these thing i delight  saith the lord  9  25 behold  the day come  saith the lord  that i will punish all them which are circumcis with the uncircumcis  9  26 egypt  and judah  and edom  and the children of ammon  and moab  and all that are in the utmost corner  that dwell in the wilder  for all these nation are uncircumcis  and

dismay at the sign of heaven  for the heathen are dismay at them  10  3 for the custom of the peopl are vain  for one cutteth a tree out of the forest  the work of the hand of the workman  with the axe  10  4 they deck it with silver and with gold  they fasten it with nail and with hammer  that it move not  10  5 they are upright as the palm tree  but speak not  they must need be born  becaus they cannot go  be not afraid of them  for they cannot do evil  neither also is it in them to do good  10  6 forasmuch as there is none like unto thee  o lord  thou art great  and thi name is great in might  10  7 who would not fear thee  o king of nation  for to thee doth it appertain  forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nation  and in all their kingdom  there is none like unto thee  10  8 but they are altogeth brutish and foolish  the stock is a doctrin of vaniti  10  9 silver spread into plate is brought from tarshish  and gold from uphaz  the work of the workman  and of the hand of

the nation shall not be abl to abid his indign  10  11 thus shall ye say unto them  the god that have not made the heaven and the earth  even they shall perish from the earth  and from under these heaven  10  12 he hath made the earth by his power  he hath establish the world by his wisdom  and hath stretch out the heaven by his discret  10  13 when he uttereth his voic  there is a multitud of water in the heaven  and he causeth the vapour to ascend from the end of the earth  he maketh lightn with rain  and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasur  10  14 everi man is brutish in his knowledg  everi founder is confound by the graven imag  for his molten imag is falsehood  and there is no breath in them  10  15 they are vaniti  and the work of error  in the time of their visit they

heathen that know thee not  and upon the famili that call not on thi name  for they have eaten up jacob  and devour him  and consum him  and have made his habit desol  11  1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord say  11  2 hear ye the word of this coven  and speak unto the men of judah  and to the inhabit of jerusalem  11  3 and say thou unto them  thus saith the lord god of israel

they did them not  11  9 and the lord said unto me  a conspiraci is found among the men of judah  and among the inhabit of jerusalem  11  10 they are turn back to the iniqu of their forefath  which refus to hear my word  and they went after other god to serv them  the hous of israel and the hous of judah have broken my coven which i made with their father  11  11 therefor thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring evil upon them  which they shall not be abl to escap  and though they shall cri unto me  i will not hearken unto them  11  12 then shall the citi of judah and inhabit of jerusalem go  and cri unto the god unto whom they offer incens  but they shall not save them at all in the time of their troubl  11  13 for accord to the number of thi citi were thi god  o judah  and accord to the number of the street of jerusalem have ye set up altar to that shame thing  even altar to burn incens unto baal  11  14 therefor pray not thou for this peopl  neither lift up a cri or prayer for

rememb  11  20 but  o lord of host  that judgest righteous  that triest the rein and the heart  let me see thi vengeanc on them  for unto thee have i reveal my caus  11  21 therefor thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth  that seek thi life  say  prophesi not in the name of the lord  that thou die not by our hand  11  22 therefor thus saith the lord of host  behold  i will punish them  the young men shall die by the sword  their son and their daughter shall die by famin  11  23 and there shall be no remnant of them  for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth  even the year of their

thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbour  that touch the inherit which i have caus my peopl israel to inherit  behold  i will pluck them out of their land  and pluck out the hous of judah from among them  12  15 and it shall come to pass  after that i have pluck them out i will return  and have compass on them  and will bring them again  everi man to his heritag  and everi man to his land  12  16 and it shall come to pass  if they will dilig learn the way of my peopl  to swear by my name  the lord liveth  as they taught my peopl to swear by baal  then shall they be built in the

after mani day  that the lord said unto me  aris  go to euphrat  and take the girdl from thenc  which i command thee to hide there  13  7 then i went to euphrat  and dig  and took the girdl from the place where i had hid it  and  behold  the girdl was mar  it was profit for noth  13  8 then the word of the lord came unto me  say  13  9 thus saith the lord  after this manner will i mar the pride

shall even be as this girdl  which is good for noth  13  11 for as the girdl cleaveth to the loin of a man  so have i caus to cleav unto me the whole hous of israel and the whole hous of judah  saith the lord  that they might be unto me for a peopl  and for a name  and for a prais  and for a glori  but they would not hear  13  12 therefor thou shalt speak unto them this word  thus saith the lord god of israel  everi bottl shall be fill with wine  and they shall say unto thee  do we not certain know that everi bottl shall be fill with wine  13  13 then shalt thou say unto them  thus saith the

 13  18 say unto the king and to the queen  humbl yourselv  sit down  for your princip shall come down  even the crown of your glori  13  19 the citi of the south shall be shut up  and none shall open

then may ye also do good  that are accustom to do evil  13  24 therefor will i scatter them as the stubbl that passeth away by the wind of the wilder  13  25 this is thi lot  the portion of thi measur from me  saith the lord  becaus thou hast forgotten me  and trust in falsehood  13  26 therefor will i discov thi skirt upon thi face  that thi shame may appear  13  27 i have seen thine adulteri  and thi neigh  the lewd of thi whoredom  and thine abomin on the hill in the field  woe unto thee  o jerusalem  wilt thou not be made clean  when shall it onc be  14  1 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concern the dearth  14  2 judah mourneth  and the gate thereof languish  they are black unto the ground  and the cri of jerusalem is gone up  14  3 and their nobl have sent their littl one to the water  they came to the pit  and found no water  they return with their vessel empti  they were asham and confound  and cover their head  14  4 becaus the ground is chapt  for there was no rain in the earth  the plowmen were asham  they cover their head  14  5 yea  the hind also calv in the field  and forsook it  becaus there was no grass  14  6 and the wild ass did stand in the high place  they snuf up the wind like dragon  their eye did fail  becaus there was no grass  14  7 o lord  though our iniqu testifi against us  do thou it for thi name  s sake  for our backslid are mani  we have sin against thee  14  8 o the hope of israel  the saviour thereof in time of troubl  whi shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land  and as a wayfar man that turneth asid to tarri for a night  14  9 whi shouldest thou be as a man astoni  as a mighti man that cannot save  yet thou  o lord  art in the midst of us  and we are call by thi name  leav us not  14  10 thus saith the lord unto this peopl  thus have they love to wander  they have not refrain their feet  therefor the lord doth not accept them  he will now rememb their iniqu  and visit their sin  14  11 then said the lord unto me  pray not for this peopl for their good  14  12 when they fast  i will not hear their cri  and when they offer burnt offer and an oblat  i will not accept them  but i will consum them by the sword  and by the famin  and by the pestil  14  13 then said i  ah  lord god  behold  the prophet say unto them  ye shall not see the sword  neither shall ye have famin  but i will give you assur peac in this place  14  14 then the lord said unto me  the prophet prophesi lie in my name  i sent them not  neither have i command them  neither spake unto them  they prophesi unto you a fals vision and divin  and a thing of nought  and the deceit of their heart  14  15 therefor thus saith the lord concern the prophet that prophesi in my name  and i sent them not  yet they say  sword and famin shall not be in this land  by sword and famin shall those prophet be consum  14  16 and the peopl to whom they prophesi shall be cast out in the street of jerusalem becaus of the famin and the sword  and they shall have none to buri them  them  their wive  nor their son  nor their daughter  for i will pour their wicked upon them  14  17 therefor thou shalt say this word unto them  let mine eye run down with tear night and day  and let them not ceas  for the virgin daughter of my peopl is broken with a great breach  with a veri grievous blow  14  18 if i go forth into the field  then behold the slain with the

beast of the earth  to devour and destroy  15  4 and i will caus them to be remov into all kingdom of the earth  becaus of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah  for that which he did in jerusalem  15  5 for who shall have piti upon thee  o jerusalem  or who shall bemoan thee  or who shall go asid to ask how thou doest  15  6 thou hast forsaken me  saith the lord  thou art gone backward  therefor will i stretch out my hand against thee  and destroy thee  i am weari with repent  15  7 and i will fan them with a fan in the gate of the land  i will bereav them of children  i will destroy my peopl sinc they return not from their way  15  8 their widow are increas to me abov the sand of the sea  i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at

the enemi to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of afflict  15  12 shall iron break the northern iron and the steel  15  13 thi substanc and thi treasur will i give to the spoil without price  and that for all thi sin  even in all thi border  15  14 and i will make thee to pass with thine enemi into a land which thou knowest not  for a fire is kindl in mine anger  which shall burn upon you  15  15 o lord  thou knowest  rememb me  and visit me  and reveng me of my persecutor  take me not away in thi longsuff  know that for thi sake i have suffer rebuk  15  16 thi word were

let them return unto thee  but return not thou unto them  15  20 and i will make thee unto this peopl a fenc brasen wall  and they shall fight against thee  but they shall not prevail against thee  for i am with thee to save thee and to deliv thee  saith the lord  15  21 and i will deliv thee out of the hand of the wick  and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terribl  16  1 the word of

shall they be buri  but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth  and they shall be consum by the sword  and by famin  and their carcas shall be meat for the fowl of heaven  and for the beast of the earth  16  5 for thus saith the lord  enter not into the hous of mourn  neither go to lament nor bemoan them  for i have taken away my peac from this peopl  saith the lord  even lovingkind and merci  16  6 both the great and the small shall die in this land  they shall not be buri  neither shall men lament for them  nor cut themselv  nor make themselv bald for them  16  7 neither shall men

and the voic of glad  the voic of the bridegroom  and the voic of the bride  16  10 and it shall come to pass  when thou shalt shew this peopl all these word  and they shall say unto thee  wherefor hath the lord pronounc all this great evil against us  or what is our iniqu  or what is our sin that we have commit against the lord our god  16  11 then shalt thou say unto them  becaus your father

to know mine hand and my might  and they shall know that my name is the lord  17  1 the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron  and with the point of a diamond  it is graven upon the tabl of their heart  and upon the horn of your altar  17  2 whilst their children rememb their altar and their grove by the green tree upon the high hill  17  3 o my mountain in the field  i will give thi substanc and all thi treasur to the spoil  and thi high place for sin  throughout all thi border  17  4 and thou  even thyself  shalt discontinu from thine heritag that i gave thee  and i will caus thee to serv thine enemi in the land which thou knowest not  for ye have kindl a fire in mine anger  which shall burn for ever  17  5 thus saith the lord  curs be the man that trusteth in man  and maketh flesh his arm  and whose heart departeth from the lord  17  6 for he shall be like the heath in the desert  and shall not see when good cometh  but shall inhabit the parch place in the wilder  in a salt land and not inhabit  17  7 bless is the man that trusteth in the lord  and whose hope the lord is  17  8 for he shall be as a tree plant by the water  and that spreadeth out her root by the river  and shall not see when heat cometh  but her leaf shall be green  and shall not be care in the year of drought  neither shall ceas from yield fruit  17  9 the heart is deceit abov all thing  and

of jerusalem  17  20 and say unto them  hear ye the word of the lord  ye king of judah  and all judah  and all the inhabit of jerusalem  that enter in by these gate  17  21 thus saith the lord  take heed to yourselv  and bear no burden on the sabbath day  nor bring it in by the gate of jerusalem  17  22 neither carri forth a burden out of your hous on the sabbath day  neither do ye ani work  but hallow ye the sabbath day  as i command your father  17  23 but they obey not  neither inclin their ear  but made their neck stiff  that they might not hear  nor receiv instruct  17  24 and it shall come to pass  if ye dilig hearken unto me  saith the lord  to bring in no burden through the gate of this citi on the sabbath day  but hallow the sabbath day  to do no work therein  17  25 then shall there enter into the gate of this citi king and princ sit upon the throne of david  ride in chariot and on hors  they  and their princ  the men of judah  and the inhabit of jerusalem  and this citi shall remain for ever  17  26 and they shall come from the citi of judah  and from the place about jerusalem  and from the land of benjamin  and from the plain  and from the mountain  and from the south  bring burnt offer  and sacrific  and meat offer  and incens  and bring sacrific of prais  unto the hous of the lord  17  27 but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day  and not to bear a burden  even enter in at the gate of jerusalem on the sabbath day  then will i kindl a fire in the gate thereof  and it shall devour the palac of jerusalem  and it shall not be quench  18  1 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord  say  18  2 aris  and go down to the potter  s hous  and there i will caus thee to hear my word  18  3 then i went down to the potter  s hous  and  behold  he wrought a work on the wheel  18  4 and the vessel that he made of clay was mar in the hand of the potter  so he made it again anoth vessel  as seem good to the potter to make it  18  5 then the word of the lord came to me  say  18  6 o hous of israel  cannot i do with you as this potter  saith the lord  behold  as the clay is in the potter  s hand  so are ye in mine hand  o hous of israel  18  7 at what instant i shall speak concern a nation  and concern a kingdom  to pluck up  and to pull down  and to destroy it  18  8 if that nation  against whom i have pronounc  turn from their evil  i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them  18  9 and at what instant i shall speak concern a nation  and concern a kingdom  to build and to plant it  18  10 if it do evil in my sight  that it obey not my voic  then i will repent of the good  wherewith i said i would benefit them  18  11 now therefor go to  speak to the men of judah  and to the inhabit of jerusalem  say  thus saith the lord  behold  i frame evil against you  and devis a devic against you  return ye now everi one from his evil way  and make your way and your do good  18  12 and they said  there is no hope  but we will walk after our own devic  and we will everi one do the imagin of his evil heart  18  13 therefor thus saith the lord  ask ye now among the heathen  who hath heard such thing  the virgin of israel hath done a veri horribl thing  18  14 will a man leav the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field  or shall the cold flow water that come from anoth place be forsaken  18  15 becaus my peopl hath forgotten me  they have burn incens to vaniti  and they have caus them to stumbl in their way from the ancient path  to walk in path  in a way not cast up  18  16 to make their land desol  and a perpetu hiss  everi one that passeth therebi shall be astonish  and wag his head  18  17 i will scatter them as with an east wind befor the enemi  i will shew them the back  and not the face  in the day of their calam  18  18 then said they  come and let us devis devic against jeremiah  for the law shall not perish from the priest  nor counsel from the wise  nor the word from the prophet  come  and let us smite him with the tongu  and let us not give heed to ani of his word  18  19 give heed to me  o lord  and hearken to the voic of them that contend with me  18  20 shall evil be recompens for good  for they have dig a pit for my soul  rememb that i stood befor thee to speak good for them  and to turn away thi wrath from them  18  21 therefor deliv up their children to the famin  and pour out their blood by the forc of the sword  and let their wive be bereav of their children  and be widow  and let their men be put to death  let their young men be slain by the sword in battl  18  22 let a cri be heard from their hous  when thou shalt bring a troop sudden upon them  for they have dig a pit to take me  and hid snare for my feet  18  23 yet  lord  thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me  forgiv not their iniqu  neither blot out their sin from thi sight  but let them be overthrown befor thee  deal thus with them in the time of thine anger  19  1 thus saith the lord  go and get a potter  s earthen bottl  and take of the ancient of the peopl  and of the ancient of the priest  19  2 and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom  which is by the entri of the east gate  and proclaim there the word that i shall tell thee  19  3 and say  hear ye the word of the lord  o king of judah  and inhabit of jerusalem  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will bring evil upon this place  the which whosoev heareth  his ear shall tingl  19  4 becaus they have forsaken me  and have estrang this place  and have burn incens in it unto other god  whom neither they nor their father have known  nor the king of judah  and have fill this place with the blood of innoc  19  5 they have built also the high place of baal  to burn their son with fire for burnt offer unto baal  which i command not  nor spake it  neither came it into my mind  19  6 therefor  behold  the day come  saith the lord  that this place shall no more be call tophet  nor the valley of the son of hinnom  but the valley of slaughter  19  7 and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place  and i will caus them to fall by the sword befor their enemi  and by the hand of them that seek their live  and their carcas will i give to be meat for the fowl of the heaven  and for the beast of the earth  19  8 and i will make this citi desol  and an hiss  everi one that passeth therebi shall be astonish and hiss becaus of all the plagu thereof  19  9 and i will caus them to eat the flesh of their son and the flesh of their daughter  and they shall eat everi one the flesh of his friend in the sieg and strait  wherewith their enemi  and they that seek their live  shall straiten them  19  10 then shalt thou break the bottl in the sight of the men that go with thee  19  11 and shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord of host  even so will i break this peopl and this citi  as one breaketh a potter  s vessel  that cannot be made whole again  and they shall buri them in tophet  till there be no place to buri  19  12 thus will i do unto this place  saith the lord  and to the inhabit thereof  and even make this citi as tophet  19  13 and the hous of jerusalem  and the hous of the king of judah  shall be defil as the place of tophet  becaus of all the hous upon whose roof they have burn incens unto all the host of heaven  and have pour out drink offer unto other god  19  14 then came jeremiah from tophet  whither the lord had sent him to prophesi  and he stood in the court of the lord  s hous  and said to all the peopl  19  15 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will bring upon this citi and upon all her town all the evil that i have pronounc against it  becaus they have harden their neck  that they might not hear my word  20  1 now pashur the son of immer the priest  who was also chief governor in the hous of the lord  heard that jeremiah prophesi these thing  20  2 then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet  and put him in the stock that were in the high gate of benjamin  which was by the hous of the lord  20  3 and it came to pass on the morrow  that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stock  then said jeremiah unto him  the lord hath not call thi name pashur  but magormissabib  20  4 for thus saith the lord  behold  i will make thee a terror to thyself  and to all thi friend  and they shall fall by the sword of their enemi  and thine eye shall behold it  and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall carri them captiv into babylon  and shall slay them with the sword  20  5 moreov i will deliv all the strength of this citi  and all the labour thereof  and all the precious thing thereof  and all the treasur of the king of judah will i give into the hand of their enemi  which shall spoil them  and take them  and carri them to babylon  20  6 and thou  pashur  and all that dwell in thine hous shall go into captiv  and thou shalt come to babylon  and there thou shalt die  and shalt be buri there  thou  and all thi friend  to whom thou hast prophesi lie  20  7 o lord  thou hast deceiv me  and i was deceiv  thou art stronger than i  and hast prevail  i am in deris daili  everi one mocketh me  20  8 for sinc i spake  i cri out  i cri violenc and spoil  becaus the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me  and a deris  daili  20  9 then i said  i will not make mention of him  nor speak ani more in his name  but his word was in mine heart as a burn fire shut up in my bone  and i was weari with forbear  and i could not stay  20  10 for i heard the defam of mani  fear on everi side  report  say they  and we will report it  all my familiar watch for my halt  say  peradventur he will be entic  and we shall prevail against him  and we shall take our reveng on him  20  11 but the lord is with me as a mighti terribl one  therefor my persecutor shall stumbl  and they shall not prevail  they shall be great asham  for they shall not prosper  their everlast confus shall never be forgotten  20  12 but  o lord of host  that triest the righteous  and seest the rein and the heart  let me see thi vengeanc on them  for unto thee have i open my caus  20  13 sing unto the lord  prais ye the lord  for he hath deliv the soul of the poor from the hand of evildo  20  14 curs be the day wherein i was born  let not the day wherein my mother bare me be bless  20  15 curs be the man who brought tide to my father  say  a man child is born unto thee  make him veri glad  20  16 and let that man be as the citi which the lord overthrew  and repent not  and let him hear the cri in the morn  and the shout at noontid  20  17 becaus he slew me not from the womb  or that my mother might have been my grave  and her womb to be alway great with me  20  18 wherefor came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow  that my day should be consum with shame  21  1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord  when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah  and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest  say  21  2 enquir  i pray thee  of the lord for us  for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us  if so be that the lord will deal with us accord to all his wondrous work  that he may go up from us  21  3 then said jeremiah unto them  thus shall ye say to zedekiah  21  4 thus saith the lord god of israel  behold  i will turn back the weapon of war that are in your hand  wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon  and against the chaldean  which besieg you without the wall  and i will assembl them into the midst of this citi  21  5 and i myself will fight against you with an outstretch hand and with a strong arm  even in anger  and in furi  and in great wrath  21  6 and i will smite the inhabit of this citi  both man and beast  they shall die of a great pestil  21  7 and afterward  saith the lord  i will deliv zedekiah king of judah  and his servant  and the peopl  and such as are left in this citi from the pestil  from the sword  and from the famin  into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and into the hand of their enemi  and into the hand of those that seek their life  and he shall smite them with the edg of the sword  he shall not spare them  neither have piti  nor have merci  21  8 and unto this peopl thou shalt say  thus saith the lord  behold  i set befor you the way of life  and the way of death  21  9 he that abideth in this citi shall die by the sword  and by the famin  and by the pestil  but he that goeth out  and falleth to the chaldean that besieg you  he shall live  and his life shall be unto him for a prey  21  10 for i have set my face against this citi for evil  and not for good  saith the lord  it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall burn it with fire  21  11 and touch the hous of the king of judah  say  hear ye the word of the lord  21  12 o hous of david  thus saith the lord  execut judgment in the morn  and deliv him that is spoil out of the hand of the oppressor  lest my furi go out like fire  and burn that none can quench it  becaus of the evil of your do  21  13 behold  i am against thee  o inhabit of the valley  and rock of the plain  saith the lord  which say  who shall come down against us  or who shall enter into our habit  21  14 but i will punish you accord to the fruit of your do  saith the lord  and i will kindl a fire in the forest thereof  and it shall devour all thing round about it  22  1 thus saith the lord  go down to the hous of the king of judah  and speak there this word  22  2 and say  hear the word of the lord  o king of judah  that sittest upon the throne of david  thou  and thi servant  and thi peopl that enter in by these gate  22  3 thus saith the lord  execut ye judgment and righteous  and deliv the spoil out of the hand of the oppressor  and do no wrong  do no violenc to the stranger  the fatherless  nor the widow  neither shed innoc blood in this place  22  4 for if ye do this thing inde  then shall there enter in by the gate of this hous king sit upon the throne of david  ride in chariot and on hors  he  and his servant  and his peopl  22  5 but if ye will not hear these word  i swear by myself  saith the lord  that this hous shall becom a desol  22  6 for thus saith the lord unto the king  s hous of judah  thou art gilead unto me  and the head of lebanon  yet sure i will make thee a wilder  and citi which are not inhabit  22  7 and i will prepar destroy against thee  everi one with his weapon  and they shall cut down thi choic cedar  and cast them into the fire  22  8 and mani nation shall pass by this citi  and they shall say everi man to his neighbour  wherefor hath the lord done thus unto this great citi  22  9 then they shall answer  becaus they have forsaken the coven of the lord their god  and worship other god  and serv them  22  10 weep ye not for the dead  neither bemoan him  but weep sore for him that goeth away  for he shall return no more  nor see his nativ countri  22  11 for thus saith the lord touch shallum the son of josiah king of judah  which reign instead of josiah his father  which went forth out of this place  he shall not return thither ani more  22  12 but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captiv  and shall see this land no more  22  13 woe unto him that buildeth his hous by unright  and his chamber by wrong  that useth his neighbour  s servic without wage  and giveth him not for his work  22  14 that saith  i will build me a wide hous and larg chamber  and cutteth him out window  and it is ciel with cedar  and paint with vermilion  22  15 shalt thou reign  becaus thou closest thyself in cedar  did not thi father eat and drink  and do judgment and justic  and then it was well with him  22  16 he judg the caus of the poor and needi  then it was well with him  was not this to know me  saith the lord  22  17 but thine eye and thine heart are not but for thi covet  and for to shed innoc blood  and for oppress  and for violenc  to do it  22  18 therefor thus saith the lord concern jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  they shall not lament for him  say  ah my brother  or  ah sister  they shall not lament for him  say  ah lord  or  ah his glori  22  19 he shall be buri with the burial of an ass  drawn and cast forth beyond the gate of jerusalem  22  20 go up to lebanon  and cri  and lift up thi voic in bashan  and cri from the passag  for all thi lover are destroy  22  21 i spake unto thee in thi prosper  but thou saidst  i will not hear  this hath been thi manner from thi youth  that thou obeyedst not my voic  22  22 the wind shall eat up all thi pastor  and thi lover shall go into captiv  sure then shalt thou be asham and confound for all thi wicked  22  23 o inhabit of lebanon  that makest thi nest in the cedar  how gracious shalt thou be when pang come upon thee  the pain as of a woman in travail  22  24 as i live  saith the lord  though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand  yet would i pluck thee thenc  22  25 and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thi life  and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest  even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and into the hand of the chaldean  22  26 and i will cast thee out  and thi mother that bare thee  into anoth countri  where ye were not born  and there shall ye die  22  27 but to the land whereunto they desir to return  thither shall they not return  22  28 is this man coniah a despis broken idol  is he a vessel wherein is no pleasur  wherefor are they cast out  he and his seed  and are cast into a land which they know not  22  29 o earth  earth  earth  hear the word of the lord  22  30 thus saith the lord  write ye this man childless  a man that shall not prosper in his day  for no man of his seed shall prosper  sit upon the throne of david  and rule ani more in judah  23  1 woe be unto the pastor that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pastur  saith the lord  23  2 therefor thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastor that feed my peopl  ye have scatter my flock  and driven them away  and have not visit them  behold  i will visit upon you the evil of your do  saith the lord  23  3 and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countri whither i have driven them  and will bring them again to their fold  and they shall be fruit and increas  23  4 and i will set up shepherd over them which shall feed them  and they shall fear no more  nor be dismay  neither shall they be lack  saith the lord  23  5 behold  the day come  saith the lord  that i will rais unto david a righteous branch  and a king shall reign and prosper  and shall execut judgment and justic in the earth  23  6 in his day judah shall be save  and israel shall dwell safe  and this is his name wherebi he shall be call  the lord our righteous  23  7 therefor  behold  the day come  saith the lord  that they shall no more say  the lord liveth  which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt  23  8 but  the lord liveth  which brought up and which led the seed of the hous of israel out of the north countri  and from all countri whither i had driven them  and they shall dwell in their own land  23  9 mine heart within me is broken becaus of the prophet  all my bone shake  i am like a drunken man  and like a man whom wine hath overcom  becaus of the lord  and becaus of the word of his holi  23  10 for the land is full of adulter  for becaus of swear the land mourneth  the pleasant place of the wilder are dri up  and their cours is evil  and their forc is not right  23  11 for both prophet and priest are profan  yea  in my hous have i found their wicked  saith the lord  23  12 wherefor their way shall be unto them as slipperi way in the dark  they shall be driven on  and fall therein  for i will bring evil upon them  even the year of their visit  saith the lord  23  13 and i have seen folli in the prophet of samaria  they prophesi in baal  and caus my peopl israel to err  23  14 i have seen also in the prophet of jerusalem an horribl thing  they commit adulteri  and walk in lie  they strengthen also the hand of evildo  that none doth return from his wicked  they are all of them unto me as sodom  and the inhabit thereof as gomorrah  23  15 therefor thus saith the lord of host concern the prophet  behold  i will feed them with wormwood  and make them drink the water of gall  for from the prophet of jerusalem is profan gone forth into all the land  23  16 thus saith the lord of host  hearken not unto the word of the prophet that prophesi unto you  they make you vain  they speak a vision of their own heart  and not out of the mouth of the lord  23  17 they say still unto them that despis me  the lord hath said  ye shall have peac  and they say unto everi one that walketh after the imagin of his own heart  no evil shall come upon you  23  18 for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord  and hath perceiv and heard his word  who hath mark his word  and heard it  23  19 behold  a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in furi  even a grievous whirlwind  it shall fall grievous upon the head of the wick  23  20 the anger of the lord shall not return  until he have execut  and till he have perform the thought of his heart  in the latter day ye shall consid it perfect  23  21 i have not sent these prophet  yet they ran  i have not spoken to them  yet they prophesi  23  22 but if they had stood in my counsel  and had caus my peopl to hear my word  then they should have turn them from their evil way  and from the evil of their do  23  23 am i a god at hand  saith the lord  and not a god afar off  23  24 can ani hide himself in secret place that i shall not see him  saith the lord  do not i fill heaven and earth  saith the lord  23  25 i have heard what the prophet said  that prophesi lie in my name  say  i have dream  i have dream  23  26 how long shall this be in the heart of the prophet that prophesi lie  yea  they are prophet of the deceit of their own heart  23  27 which think to caus my peopl to forget my name by their dream which they tell everi man to his neighbour  as their father have forgotten my name for baal  23  28 the prophet that hath a dream  let him tell a dream  and he that hath my word  let him speak my word faith  what is the chaff to the wheat  saith the lord  23  29 is not my word like as a fire  saith the lord  and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in piec  23  30 therefor  behold  i am against the prophet  saith the lord  that steal my word everi one from his neighbour  23  31 behold  i am against the prophet  saith the lord  that use their tongu  and say  he saith  23  32 behold  i am against them that prophesi fals dream  saith the lord  and do tell them  and caus my peopl to err by their lie  and by their light  yet i sent them not  nor command them  therefor they shall not profit this peopl at all  saith the lord  23  33 and when this peopl  or the prophet  or a priest  shall ask thee  say  what is the burden of the lord  thou shalt then say unto them  what burden  i will even forsak you  saith the lord  23  34 and as for the prophet  and the priest  and the peopl  that shall say  the burden of the lord  i will even punish that man and his hous  23  35 thus shall ye say everi one to his neighbour  and everi one to his brother  what hath the lord answer  and  what hath the lord spoken  23  36 and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more  for everi man  s word shall be his burden  for ye have pervert the word of the live god  of the lord of host our god  23  37 thus shalt thou say to the prophet  what hath the lord answer thee  and  what hath the lord spoken  23  38 but sinc ye say  the burden of the lord  therefor thus saith the lord  becaus ye say this word  the burden of the lord  and i have sent unto you  say  ye shall not say  the burden of the lord  23  39 therefor  behold  i  even i  will utter forget you  and i will forsak you  and the citi that i gave you and your father  and cast you out of my presenc  23  40 and i will bring an everlast reproach upon you  and a perpetu shame  which shall not be forgotten  24  1 the lord shew me  and  behold  two basket of fig were set befor the templ of the lord  after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carri away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah  and the princ of judah  with the carpent and smith  from jerusalem  and had brought them to babylon  24  2 one basket had veri good fig  even like the fig that are first ripe  and the other basket had veri naughti fig  which could not be eaten  they were so bad  24  3 then said the lord unto me  what seest thou  jeremiah  and i said  fig  the good fig  veri good  and the evil  veri evil  that cannot be eaten  they are so evil  24  4 again the word of the lord came unto me  say  24  5 thus saith the lord  the god of israel  like these good fig  so will i acknowledg them that are carri away captiv of judah  whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldean for their good  24  6 for i will set mine eye upon them for good  and i will bring them again to this land  and i will build them  and not pull them down  and i will plant them  and not pluck them up  24  7 and i will give them an heart to know me  that i am the lord  and they shall be my peopl  and i will be their god  for they shall return unto me with their whole heart  24  8 and as the evil fig  which cannot be eaten  they are so evil  sure thus saith the lord  so will i give zedekiah the king of judah  and his princ  and the residu of jerusalem  that remain in this land  and them that dwell in the land of egypt  24  9 and i will deliv them to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth for their hurt  to be a reproach and a proverb  a taunt and a curs  in all place whither i shall drive them  24  10 and i will send the sword  the famin  and the pestil  among them  till they be consum from off the land that i gave unto them and to their father  25  1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the peopl of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  25  2 the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the peopl of judah  and to all the inhabit of jerusalem  say  25  3 from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah  even unto this day  that is the three and twentieth year  the word of the lord hath come unto me  and i have spoken unto you  rise earli and speak  but ye have not hearken  25  4 and the lord hath sent unto you all his servant the prophet  rise earli and send them  but ye have not hearken  nor inclin your ear to hear  25  5 they said  turn ye again now everi one from his evil way  and from the evil of your do  and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your father for ever and ever  25  6 and go not after other god to serv them  and to worship them  and provok me not to anger with the work of your hand  and i will do you no hurt  25  7 yet ye have not hearken unto me  saith the lord  that ye might provok me to anger with the work of your hand to your own hurt  25  8 therefor thus saith the lord of host  becaus ye have not heard my word  25  9 behold  i will send and take all the famili of the north  saith the lord  and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and will bring them against this land  and against the inhabit thereof  and against all these nation round about  and will utter destroy them  and make them an astonish  and an hiss  and perpetu desol  25  10 moreov i will take from them the voic of mirth  and the voic of glad  the voic of the bridegroom  and the voic of the bride  the sound of the millston  and the light of the candl  25  11 and this whole land shall be a desol  and an astonish  and these nation shall serv the king of babylon seventi year  25  12 and it shall come to pass  when seventi year are accomplish  that i will punish the king of babylon  and that nation  saith the lord  for their iniqu  and the land of

26  2 thus saith the lord  stand in the court of the lord  s hous  and speak unto all the citi of judah  which come to worship in the lord  s hous  all the word that i command thee to speak unto them  diminish not a word  26  3 if so be they will hearken  and turn everi man from his evil way  that i may repent me of the evil  which i purpos to do unto them becaus of the evil of their do  26  4 and thou shalt say unto them  thus saith the lord  if ye will not hearken to me  to walk in my law  which i have set befor you  26  5 to hearken to the word of my servant the prophet  whom i sent unto you  both rise up earli  and send them  but ye have not hearken  26  6 then will i make this hous like shiloh  and will make this citi a curs to all the nation of the earth  26  7 so the priest and the prophet and all the peopl heard jeremiah speak these word in the hous of the lord  26  8 now it came to pass  when jeremiah had made an end of speak all that the lord had command him to speak unto all the peopl  that the priest and the prophet and all the peopl took him  say  thou shalt sure die  26  9 whi hast thou prophesi in the name of the lord  say  this hous shall be like shiloh  and this citi shall be desol without an inhabit  and all the peopl were gather against jeremiah in the hous of the lord  26  10 when the princ of judah heard these thing  then they came up from the king  s hous unto the hous of the lord  and sat down in the entri of the new gate of the lord  s hous  26  11 then spake the priest and the prophet unto the princ and to all the peopl  say  this man is worthi to die  for he hath prophesi against this citi  as ye have heard with your ear  26  12 then spake jeremiah unto all the princ and to all the peopl  say  the lord sent me to prophesi against this hous and against this citi all the word that ye have heard  26  13 therefor now amend your way and your do  and obey the voic of the lord your god  and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounc against you  26  14 as for me  behold  i am in your hand  do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you  26  15 but know ye for certain  that if ye put me to death  ye shall sure bring innoc blood upon yourselv  and upon this citi  and upon the inhabit thereof  for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these word in your ear  26  16 then said the princ and all the peopl unto the priest and to the prophet  this man is not worthi to die  for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god  26  17 then rose up certain of the elder of the land  and spake to all the assembl of the peopl  say  26  18 micah the morasthit prophesi in the day of hezekiah king of judah  and spake to all the peopl of judah  say  thus saith the lord of host  zion shall be plow like a field  and jerusalem shall becom heap  and the mountain of the hous as the high place of a forest  26  19 did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death  did he not fear the lord  and besought the lord  and the lord repent him of the evil which he had pronounc against them  thus might we procur great evil against our soul  26  20 and there was also a man that prophesi in the name of the lord  urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim  who prophesi against this citi and against this land accord to all the word of jeremiah  26  21 and when jehoiakim the king  with all his mighti men  and all the princ  heard his word  the king sought to put him to death  but when urijah heard it  he was afraid  and fled  and went into egypt  26  22 and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt  name  elnathan the son of achbor  and certain men with him into egypt  26  23 and they fetch forth urijah out of egypt  and brought him unto jehoiakim the king  who slew him with the sword  and cast his dead bodi into the grave of the common peopl  26  24 nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah  that they should not give him into the hand of the peopl to put him to death  27  1 in the begin of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord  say  27  2 thus saith the lord to me  make thee bond and yoke  and put them upon thi neck  27  3 and send them to the king of edom  and to the king of moab  and to the king of the ammonit  and to the king of tyrus  and to the king of zidon  by the hand of the messeng which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah  27  4 and command them to say unto their master  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  thus shall ye say unto your master  27  5 i have made the earth  the man and the beast that are upon the ground  by my great power and by my outstretch arm  and have given it unto whom it seem meet unto me  27  6 and now have i given all these land into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and the beast of the field have i given him also to serv him  27  7 and all nation shall serv him  and his son  and his son  s son  until the veri time of his land come  and then mani nation and great king shall serv themselv of him  27  8 and it shall come to pass  that the nation and kingdom which will not serv the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon  and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon  that nation will i punish  saith the lord  with the sword  and with the famin  and with the pestil  until i have consum them by his hand  27  9 therefor hearken not ye to your prophet  nor to your divin  nor to your dreamer  nor to your enchant  nor to your sorcer  which speak unto you  say  ye shall not serv the king of babylon  27  10 for they prophesi a lie unto you  to remov you far from your land  and that i should drive you out  and ye should perish  27  11 but the nation that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon  and serv him  those will i let remain still in their own land  saith the lord  and they shall till it  and dwell therein  27  12 i spake also to zedekiah king of judah accord to all these word  say  bring your neck under the yoke of the king of babylon  and serv him and his peopl  and live  27  13 whi will ye die  thou and thi peopl  by the sword  by the famin  and by the pestil  as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serv the king of babylon  27  14 therefor hearken not unto the word of the prophet that speak unto you  say  ye shall not serv the king of babylon  for they prophesi a lie unto you  27  15 for i have not sent them  saith the lord  yet they prophesi a lie in my name  that i might drive you out  and that ye might perish  ye  and the prophet that prophesi unto you  27  16 also i spake to the priest and to all this peopl  say  thus saith the lord  hearken not to the word of your prophet that prophesi unto you  say  behold  the vessel of the lord  s hous shall now short be brought again from babylon  for they prophesi a lie unto you  27  17 hearken not unto them  serv the king of babylon  and live  wherefor should this citi be laid wast  27  18 but if they be prophet  and if the word of the lord be with them  let them now make intercess to the lord of host  that the vessel which are left in the hous of the lord  and in the hous of the king of judah  and at jerusalem  go not to babylon  27  19 for thus saith the lord of host concern the pillar  and concern the sea  and concern the base  and concern the residu of the vessel that remain in this citi  27  20 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not  when he carri away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon  and all the nobl of judah and jerusalem  27  21 yea  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  concern the vessel that remain in the hous of the lord  and in the hous of the king of judah and of jerusalem  27  22 they shall be carri to babylon  and there shall they be until the day that i visit them  saith the lord  then will i bring them up  and restor them to this place  28  1 and it came to pass the same year  in the begin of the reign of zedekiah king of judah  in the fourth year  and in the fifth month  that hananiah the son of azur the prophet  which was of gibeon  spake unto me in the hous of the lord  in the presenc of the priest and of all the peopl  say  28  2 thus speaketh the lord of host  the god of israel  say  i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon  28  3 within two full year will i bring again into this place all the vessel of the lord  s hous  that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place  and carri them to babylon  28  4 and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah  with all the captiv of judah  that went into babylon  saith the lord  for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon  28  5 then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presenc of the priest  and in the presenc of all the peopl that stood in the hous of the lord  28  6 even the prophet jeremiah said  amen  the lord do so  the lord perform thi word which thou hast prophesi  to bring again the vessel of the lord  s hous  and all that is carri away captiv  from babylon into this place  28  7 nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ear  and in the ear of all the peopl  28  8 the prophet that have been befor me and befor thee of old prophesi both against mani countri  and against great kingdom  of war  and of evil  and of pestil  28  9 the prophet which prophesieth of peac  when the word of the prophet shall come to pass  then shall the prophet be known  that the lord hath truli sent him  28  10 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah  s neck  and brake it  28  11 and hananiah spake in the presenc of all the peopl  say  thus saith the lord  even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nation within the space of two full year  and the prophet jeremiah went his way  28  12 then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet  after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah  say  28  13 go and tell hananiah  say  thus saith the lord  thou hast broken the yoke of wood  but thou shalt make for them yoke of iron  28  14 for thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nation  that they may serv nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and they shall serv him  and i have given him the beast of the field also  28  15 then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet  hear now  hananiah  the lord hath not sent thee  but thou makest this peopl to trust in a lie  28  16 therefor thus saith the lord  behold  i will cast thee from off the face of the earth  this year thou shalt die  becaus thou hast taught rebellion against the lord  28  17 so hananiah the prophet die the same year in the seventh month  29  1 now these are the word of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residu of the elder which were carri away captiv  and to the priest  and to the prophet  and to all the peopl whom nebuchadnezzar had carri away captiv from jerusalem to babylon  29  2  after that jeconiah the king  and the queen  and the eunuch  the princ of judah and jerusalem  and the carpent  and the smith  were depart from jerusalem  29  3 by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan  and gemariah the son of hilkiah   whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  say  29  4 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  unto all that are carri away captiv  whom i have caus to be carri away from jerusalem unto babylon  29  5 build ye hous  and dwell in them  and plant garden  and eat the fruit of them  29  6 take ye wive  and beget son and daughter  and take wive for your son  and give your daughter to husband  that they may bear son and daughter  that ye may be increas there  and not diminish  29  7 and seek the peac of the citi whither i have caus you to be carri away captiv  and pray unto the lord for it  for in the peac thereof shall ye have peac  29  8 for thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  let not your prophet and your divin  that be in the midst of you  deceiv you  neither hearken to your dream which ye caus to be dream  29  9 for they prophesi fals unto you in my name  i have not sent them  saith the lord  29  10 for thus saith the lord  that after seventi year be accomplish at babylon i will visit you  and perform my good word toward you  in caus you to return to this place  29  11 for i know the thought that i think toward you  saith the lord  thought of peac  and not of evil  to give you an expect end  29  12 then shall ye call upon me  and ye shall go and pray unto me  and i will hearken unto you  29  13 and ye shall seek me  and find me  when ye shall search for me with all your heart  29  14 and i will be found of you  saith the lord  and i will turn away your captiv  and i will gather you from all the nation  and from all the place whither i have driven you  saith the lord  and i will bring you again into the place whenc i caus you to be carri away captiv  29  15 becaus ye have said  the lord hath rais us up prophet in babylon  29  16 know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david  and of all the peopl that dwelleth in this citi  and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captiv  29  17 thus saith the lord of host  behold  i will send upon them the sword  the famin  and the pestil  and will make them like vile fig  that cannot be eaten  they are so evil  29  18 and i will persecut them with the sword  with the famin  and with the pestil  and will deliv them to be remov to all the kingdom of the earth  to be a curs  and an astonish  and an hiss  and a reproach  among all the nation whither i have driven them  29  19 becaus they have not hearken to my word  saith the lord  which i sent unto them by my servant the prophet  rise up earli and send them  but ye would not hear  saith the lord  29  20 hear ye therefor the word of the lord  all ye of the captiv  whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon  29  21 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  of ahab the son of kolaiah  and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah  which prophesi a lie unto you in my name  behold  i will deliv them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and he shall slay them befor your eye  29  22 and of them shall be taken up a curs by all the captiv of judah which are in babylon  say  the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab  whom the king of babylon roast in the fire  29  23 becaus they have commit villani in israel  and have commit adulteri with their neighbour  wive  and have spoken lie word in my name  which i have not command them  even i know  and am a wit  saith the lord  29  24 thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamit  say  29  25 thus speaketh the lord of host  the god of israel  say  becaus thou hast sent letter in thi name unto all the peopl that are at jerusalem  and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest  and to all the priest  say  29  26 the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest  that ye should be offic in the hous of the lord  for everi man that is mad  and maketh himself a prophet  that thou shouldest put him in prison  and in the stock  29  27 now therefor whi hast thou not reprov jeremiah of anathoth  which maketh himself a prophet to you  29  28 for therefor he sent unto us in babylon  say  this captiv is long  build ye hous  and dwell in them  and plant garden  and eat the fruit of them  29  29 and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ear of jeremiah the prophet  29  30 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  say  29  31 send to all them of the captiv  say  thus saith the lord concern shemaiah the nehelamit  becaus that shemaiah hath prophesi unto you  and i sent him not  and he caus you to trust in a lie  29  32 therefor thus saith the lord  behold  i will punish shemaiah the nehelamit  and his seed  he shall not have a man to dwell among this peopl  neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my peopl  saith the lord  becaus he hath taught rebellion against the lord  30  1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  say  30  2 thus speaketh the lord god of israel  say  write thee all the word that i have spoken unto thee in a book  30  3 for  lo  the day come  saith the lord  that i will bring again the captiv of my peopl israel and judah  saith the lord  and i will caus them to return to the land that i gave to their father  and they shall possess it  30  4 and these are the word that the lord spake concern israel and concern judah  30  5 for thus saith the lord  we have heard a voic of trembl  of fear  and not of peac  30  6 ask ye now  and see whether a man doth travail with child  wherefor do i see everi man with his hand on his loin  as a woman in travail  and all face are turn into pale  30  7 ala  for that day is great  so that none is like it  it is even the time of jacob  s troubl  but he shall be save out of it  30  8 for it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord of host  that i will break his yoke from off thi neck  and will burst thi bond  and stranger shall no more serv themselv of him  30  9 but they shall serv the lord their god  and david their king  whom i will rais up unto them  30  10 therefor fear thou not  o my servant jacob  saith the lord  neither be dismay  o israel  for  lo  i will save thee from afar  and thi seed from the land of their captiv  and jacob shall return  and shall be in rest  and be quiet  and none shall make him afraid  30  11 for i am with thee  saith the lord  to save thee  though i make a full end of all nation whither i have scatter thee  yet i will not make a full end of thee  but i will correct thee in measur  and will not leav thee altogeth unpunish  30  12 for thus saith the lord  thi bruis is incur  and thi wound is grievous  30  13 there is none to plead thi caus  that thou mayest be bound up  thou hast no heal medicin  30  14 all thi lover have forgotten thee  they seek thee not  for i have wound thee with the wound of an enemi  with the chastis of a cruel one  for the multitud of thine iniqu  becaus thi sin were increas  30  15 whi criest thou for thine afflict  thi sorrow is incur for the multitud of thine iniqu  becaus thi sin were increas  i have done these thing unto thee  30  16 therefor all they that devour thee shall be devour  and all thine adversari  everi one of them  shall go into captiv  and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil  and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey  30  17 for i will restor health unto thee  and i will heal thee of thi wound  saith the lord  becaus they call thee an outcast  say  this is zion  whom no man seeketh after  30  18 thus saith the lord  behold  i will bring again the captiv of jacob  s tent  and have merci on his dwellingplac  and the citi shall be build upon her own heap  and the palac shall remain after the manner thereof  30  19 and out of them shall proceed thanksgiv and the voic of them that make merri  and i will multipli them  and they shall not be few  i will also glorifi them  and they shall not be small  30  20 their children also shall be as aforetim  and their congreg shall be establish befor me  and i will punish all that oppress them  30  21 and their nobl shall be of themselv  and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them  and i will caus him to draw near  and he shall approach unto me  for who is this that engag his heart to approach unto me  saith the lord  30  22 and ye shall be my peopl  and i will be your god  30  23 behold  the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with furi  a continu whirlwind  it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wick  30  24 the fierc anger of the lord shall not return  until he hath done it  and until he have perform the intent of his heart  in the latter day ye shall consid it  31  1 at the same time  saith the lord  will i be the god of all the famili of israel  and they shall be my peopl  31  2 thus saith the lord  the peopl which were left of the sword found grace in the wilder  even israel  when i went to caus him to rest  31  3 the lord hath appear of old unto me  say  yea  i have love thee with an everlast love  therefor with lovingkind have i drawn thee  31  4 again i will build thee  and thou shalt be built  o virgin of israel  thou shalt again be adorn with thi tabret  and shalt go forth in the danc of them that make merri  31  5 thou shalt yet plant vine upon the mountain of samaria  the planter shall plant  and shall eat them as common thing  31  6 for there shall be a day  that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cri  aris ye  and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god  31  7 for thus saith the lord  sing with glad for jacob  and shout among the chief of the nation  publish ye  prais ye  and say  o lord  save thi peopl  the remnant of israel  31  8 behold  i will bring them from the north countri  and gather them from the coast of the earth  and with them the blind and the lame  the woman with child and her that travaileth with child togeth  a great compani shall return thither  31  9 they shall come with weep  and with supplic will i lead them  i will caus them to walk by the river of water in a straight way  wherein they shall not stumbl  for i am a father to israel  and ephraim is my firstborn  31  10 hear the word of the lord  o ye nation  and declar it in the isl afar off  and say  he that scatter israel will gather him  and keep him  as a shepherd doth his flock  31  11 for the lord hath redeem jacob  and ransom him

for the young of the flock and of the herd  and their soul shall be as a water garden  and they shall not sorrow ani more at all  31  13 then shall the virgin rejoic in the danc  both young men and old togeth  for i will turn their mourn into joy  and will comfort them  and make them rejoic from their sorrow  31  14 and i will satiat the soul of the priest with fat  and my peopl shall be satisfi with my good  saith the lord  31  15 thus saith the lord  a voic was heard in ramah  lament  and bitter weep  rahel weep for her children refus to be comfort for her children  becaus they were not  31  16 thus saith the lord  refrain thi voic from weep  and thine eye from tear  for thi work shall be reward  saith the lord  and they shall come again from the land of the enemi  31  17 and there is hope in thine end  saith the lord  that thi children shall come again to their own border  31  18 i have sure heard ephraim bemoan himself thus  thou hast chastis me  and i was chastis  as a bullock unaccustom to the yoke  turn thou me  and i shall be turn  for thou art the lord my god  31  19 sure after that i was turn  i repent  and after that i was instruct  i smote upon my thigh  i was asham

 30 but everi one shall die for his own iniqu  everi man that eateth the sour grape  his teeth shall be set on edg  31  31 behold  the day come  saith the lord  that i will make a new coven with the

the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner  31  39 and the measur line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb  and shall compass about to goath  31  40 and the whole valley of the dead bodi  and of the ash  and all the field unto the brook of kidron  unto the corner of the hors gate toward the east  shall be holi unto the lord  it shall not be pluck up  nor thrown down ani more for ever  32  1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah  which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar  32  2 for then the king of babylon  s armi besieg jerusalem  and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison  which was in the king of judah  s hous  32  3 for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up  say  wherefor dost thou prophesi  and say  thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this citi into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall take it  32  4 and zedekiah king of judah shall not escap out of the hand of the chaldean  but shall sure be deliv into the hand of the king of babylon  and shall speak with him mouth to mouth  and his eye shall behold his eye  32  5 and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon  and there shall he be until i visit him  saith the lord  though ye fight with the chaldean  ye shall not prosper  32  6 and jeremiah said  the word of the lord came unto me  say  32  7 behold  hanameel the son of shallum thine uncl shall come unto thee say  buy thee my field that is in anathoth  for the right of redempt is thine to buy it  32  8 so hanameel mine uncl  s son came to me in the court of the prison accord to the word of the lord  and said unto me  buy my field  i pray thee  that is in anathoth  which is in the countri of benjamin  for the right of inherit is thine  and the redempt is thine  buy it for thyself  then i knew that this was the word of the lord  32  9 and i bought the field of hanameel my uncl  s son  that was in anathoth  and weigh him the money  even seventeen shekel of silver  32  10 and i subscrib the evid  and seal it  and took wit  and weigh him the money in the balanc  32  11 so i took the evid of the purchas  both that which was seal accord to the law and custom  and that which was open  32  12 and i gave the evid of the purchas unto baruch the son of neriah  the son of maaseiah  in the sight of hanameel mine uncl  s son  and in the presenc of the wit that subscrib the book of the purchas  befor all the jew that sat in the court of the prison  32  13 and i charg baruch befor them  say  32  14 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  take these evid  this evid of the purchas  both which is seal  and this evid which is open  and put them in an earthen vessel  that they may continu mani day  32  15 for thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  hous and field and vineyard shall be possess again in this land  32  16 now when i had deliv the evid of the purchas unto baruch the son of neriah  i pray unto the lord  say  32  17 ah lord god  behold  thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thi great power and stretch out arm  and there is noth too hard for thee  32  18 thou shewest lovingkind unto thousand  and recompensest the iniqu of the father into the bosom of their children after them  the great  the mighti god  the lord of host  is his name  32  19 great in counsel  and mighti in work  for thine eye are open upon all the way of the son of men  to give everi one accord to his way  and accord to the fruit of his do  32  20 which hast set sign and wonder in the land of egypt  even unto this day  and in israel  and among other men  and hast made thee a name  as at this day  32  21 and hast brought forth thi peopl israel out of the land of egypt with sign  and with wonder  and with a strong hand  and with a stretch out arm  and with great terror  32  22 and hast given them this land  which thou didst swear to their father to give them  a land flow with milk and honey  32  23 and they came in  and possess it  but they obey not thi voic  neither walk in thi law  they have done noth of all that thou commandedst them to do  therefor thou hast caus all this evil to come upon them  32  24 behold the mount  they are come unto the citi to take it  and the citi is given into the hand of the chaldean  that fight against it  becaus of the sword  and of the famin  and of the pestil  and what thou hast spoken is come to pass  and  behold  thou seest it  32  25 and thou hast said unto me  o lord god  buy thee the field for money  and take wit  for the citi is given into the hand of the chaldean  32  26 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  say  32  27 behold  i am the lord  the god of all flesh  is there ani thing too hard for me  32  28 therefor thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this citi into the hand of the chaldean  and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  and he shall take it  32  29 and the chaldean  that fight against this citi  shall come and set fire on this citi  and burn it with the hous  upon whose roof they have offer incens unto baal  and pour out drink offer unto other god  to provok me to anger  32  30 for the children of israel and the children of judah have onli done evil befor me from their youth  for the children of israel have onli provok me to anger with the work of their hand  saith the lord  32  31 for this citi hath been to me as a provoc of mine anger and of my furi from the day that they built it even unto this day  that i should remov it from befor my face  32  32 becaus of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah  which they have done to provok me to anger  they  their king  their princ  their priest  and their prophet  and the men of judah  and the inhabit of jerusalem  32  33 and they have turn unto me the back  and not the face  though i taught them  rise up earli and teach them  yet they have not hearken to receiv instruct  32  34 but they set their abomin in the hous  which is call by my name  to defil it  32  35 and they built the high place of baal  which are in the valley of the son of hinnom  to caus their son and their daughter to pass through the fire unto molech  which i command them not  neither came it into my mind  that they should do this abomin  to caus judah to sin  32  36 and now therefor thus saith the lord  the god of israel  concern this citi  whereof ye say  it shall be deliv into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword  and by the famin  and by the pestil  32  37 behold  i will gather them out of all countri  whither i have driven them in mine anger  and in my furi  and in great wrath  and i will bring them again unto this place  and i will caus them to dwell safe  32  38 and they shall be my peopl  and i will be their god  32  39 and i will give them one heart  and one way  that they may fear me for ever  for the good of them  and of their children after them  32  40 and i will make an everlast coven with them  that i will not turn away from them  to do them good  but i will put my fear in their heart  that they shall not depart from me  32  41 yea  i will rejoic over them to do them good  and i will plant them in this land assur with my whole heart and with my whole soul  32  42 for thus saith the lord  like as i have brought all this great evil upon this peopl  so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promis them  32  43 and field shall be bought in this land  whereof ye say  it is desol without man or beast  it is given into the hand of the chaldean  32  44 men shall buy field for money  and subscrib evid  and seal them  and take wit in the land of benjamin  and in the place about jerusalem  and in the citi of judah  and in the citi of the mountain  and in the citi of the valley  and in the citi of the south  for i will caus their captiv to return  saith the lord  33  1 moreov the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time  while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison  say  33  2 thus saith the lord the maker thereof  the lord that form it  to establish it  the lord is his name  33  3 call unto me  and i will answer thee  and shew thee great and mighti thing  which thou knowest not  33  4 for thus saith the lord  the god of israel  concern the hous of this citi  and concern the hous of the king of judah  which are thrown down by the mount  and by the sword  33  5 they come to fight with the chaldean  but it is to fill them with the dead bodi of men  whom i have slain in mine anger and in my furi  and for all whose wicked i have hid my face from this citi  33  6 behold  i will bring it health and cure  and i will cure them  and will reveal unto them the abund of peac and truth  33  7 and i will caus the captiv of judah and the captiv of israel to return  and will build them  as at the first  33  8 and i will cleans them from all their iniqu  wherebi they have sin against me  and i will pardon all their iniqu  wherebi they have sin  and wherebi they have transgress against me  33  9 and it shall be to me a name of joy  a prais and an honour befor all the nation of the earth  which shall hear all the good that i do unto them  and they shall fear and trembl for all the good and for all the prosper that i procur unto it  33  10 thus saith the lord  again there shall be heard in this place  which ye say shall be desol without man and without beast  even in the citi of judah  and in the street of jerusalem  that are desol  without man  and without inhabit  and without beast  33  11 the voic of joy  and the voic of glad  the voic of the bridegroom  and the voic of the bride  the voic of them that shall say  prais the lord of host  for the lord is good  for his merci endureth for ever  and of them that shall bring the sacrific of prais into the hous of the lord  for i will caus to return the captiv of the land  as at the first  saith the lord  33  12 thus saith the lord of host  again in this place  which is desol without man and without beast  and in all the citi thereof  shall be an habit of shepherd caus their flock to lie down  33  13 in the citi of the mountain  in the citi of the vale  and in the citi of the south  and in the land of benjamin  and in the place about jerusalem  and in the citi of judah  shall the flock pass again under the hand of him that telleth them  saith the lord  33  14 behold  the day come  saith the lord  that i will perform that good thing which i have promis unto the hous of israel and to the hous of judah  33  15 in those day  and at that time  will i caus the branch of righteous to grow up unto david  and he shall execut judgment and righteous in the land  33  16 in those day shall judah be save  and jerusalem shall dwell safe  and this is the name wherewith she shall be call  the lord our righteous  33  17 for thus saith the lord  david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the hous of israel  33  18 neither shall the priest the levit want a man befor me to offer burnt offer  and to kindl meat offer  and to do sacrific continu  33  19 and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  say  33  20 thus saith the lord  if ye can break my coven of the day  and my coven of the night  and that there should not be day and night in their season  33  21 then may also my coven be broken with david my servant  that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne  and with the levit the priest  my minist  33  22 as the host of heaven cannot be number  neither the sand of the sea measur  so will i multipli the seed of david my servant  and the levit that minist unto me  33  23 moreov the word of the lord came to jeremiah  say  33  24 considerest thou not what this peopl have spoken  say  the two famili which the lord hath chosen  he hath even cast them off  thus they have despis my peopl  that they should be no more a nation befor them  33  25 thus saith the lord  if my coven be not with day and night  and if i have not appoint the ordin of heaven and earth  33  26 then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant  so that i will not take ani of his seed to be ruler over the seed of abraham  isaac  and jacob  for i will caus their captiv to return  and have merci on them  34  1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord  when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  and all his armi  and all the kingdom of the earth of his dominion  and all the peopl  fought against jerusalem  and against all the citi thereof  say  34  2 thus saith the lord  the god of israel  go and speak to zedekiah king of judah  and tell him  thus saith the lord  behold  i will give this citi into the hand of the king of babylon  and he shall burn it with fire  34  3 and thou shalt not escap out of his hand  but shalt sure be taken  and deliv into his hand  and thine eye shall behold the eye of the king of babylon  and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth  and thou shalt go to babylon  34  4 yet hear the word of the lord  o zedekiah king of judah  thus saith the lord of thee  thou shalt not die by the sword  34  5 but thou shalt die in peac  and with the burn of thi father  the former king which were befor thee  so shall they burn odour for thee  and they will lament thee  say  ah lord  for i have pronounc the word  saith the lord  34  6 then jeremiah the prophet spake all these word unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem  34  7 when the king of babylon  s armi fought against jerusalem  and against all the citi of judah that were left  against lachish  and against azekah  for these defenc citi remain of the citi of judah  34  8 this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord  after that the king zedekiah had made a coven with all the peopl which were at jerusalem  to proclaim liberti unto them  34  9 that everi man should let his manserv  and everi man his maidserv  be an hebrew or an hebrewess  go free  that none should serv himself of them  to wit  of a jew his brother  34  10 now when all the princ  and all the peopl  which had enter into the coven  heard that everi one should let his manserv  and everi one his maidserv  go free  that none should serv themselv of them ani more  then they obey  and let them go  34  11 but afterward they turn  and caus the servant and the handmaid  whom they had let go free  to return  and brought them into subject for servant and for handmaid  34  12 therefor the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord  say  34  13 thus saith the lord  the god of israel  i made a coven with your father in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt  out of the hous of bondmen  say  34  14 at the end of seven year let ye go everi man his brother an hebrew  which hath been sold unto thee  and when he hath serv thee six year  thou shalt let him go free from thee  but your father hearken not unto me  neither inclin their ear  34  15 and ye were now turn  and had done right in my sight  in proclaim liberti everi man to his neighbour  and ye had made a coven befor me in the hous which is call by my name  34  16 but ye turn and pollut my name  and caus everi man his servant  and everi man his handmaid  whom ye had set at liberti at their pleasur  to return  and brought them into subject  to be unto you for servant and for handmaid  34  17 therefor thus saith the lord  ye have not hearken unto me  in proclaim liberti  everi one to his brother  and everi man to his neighbour  behold  i proclaim a liberti for you  saith the lord  to the sword  to the pestil  and to the famin  and i will make you to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth  34  18 and i will give the men that have transgress my coven  which have not perform the word of the coven which they had made befor me  when they cut the calf in twain  and pass between the part thereof  34  19 the princ of judah  and the princ of jerusalem  the eunuch  and the priest  and all the peopl of the land  which pass between the part of the calf  34  20 i will even give them into the hand of their enemi  and into the hand of them that seek their life  and their dead bodi shall be for meat unto the fowl of the heaven  and to the beast of the earth  34  21 and zedekiah king of judah and his princ will i give into the hand of their enemi  and into the hand of them that seek their life  and into the hand of the king of babylon  s armi  which are gone up from you  34  22 behold  i will command  saith the lord  and caus them to return to this citi  and they shall fight against it  and take it  and burn it with fire  and i will make the citi of judah a desol without an inhabit  35  1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the day of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  say  35  2 go unto the hous of the rechabit  and speak unto them  and bring them into the hous of the lord  into one of the chamber  and give them wine to drink  35  3 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah  the son of habaziniah  and his brethren  and all his son  and the whole hous of the rechabit  35  4 and i brought them into the hous of the lord  into the chamber of the son of hanan  the son of igdaliah  a man of god  which was by the chamber of the princ  which was abov the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum  the keeper of the door  35  5 and i set befor the son of the hous of the rechabit pot full of wine  and cup  and i said unto them  drink ye wine  35  6 but they said  we will drink no wine  for jonadab the son of rechab our father command us  say  ye shall drink no wine  neither ye  nor your son for ever  35  7 neither shall ye build hous  nor sow seed  nor plant vineyard  nor have ani  but all your day ye shall dwell in tent  that ye may live mani day in the land where ye be stranger  35  8 thus have we obey the voic of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charg us  to drink no wine all our day  we  our wive  our son  nor our daughter  35  9 nor to build hous for us to dwell in  neither have we vineyard  nor field  nor seed  35  10 but we have dwelt in tent  and have obey  and done accord to all that jonadab our father command us  35  11 but it came to pass  when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land  that we said  come  and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the armi of the chaldean  and for fear of the armi of the syrian  so we dwell at jerusalem  35  12 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah  say  35  13 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  go and tell the men of judah and the inhabit of jerusalem  will ye not receiv instruct to hearken to my word  saith the lord  35  14 the word of jonadab the son of rechab  that he command his son not to drink wine  are perform  for unto this day they drink none  but obey their father  s command  notwithstand i have spoken unto you  rise earli and speak  but ye hearken not unto me  35  15 i have sent also unto you all my servant the prophet  rise up earli and send them  say  return ye now everi man from his evil way  and amend your do  and go not after other god to serv them  and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your father  but ye have not inclin your ear  nor hearken unto me  35  16 becaus the son of jonadab the son of rechab have perform the command of their father  which he command them  but this peopl hath not hearken unto me  35  17 therefor thus saith the lord god of host  the god of israel  behold  i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabit of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounc against them  becaus i have spoken unto them  but they have not heard  and i have call unto them  but they have not answer  35  18 and jeremiah said unto the hous of the rechabit  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  becaus ye have obey the command of jonadab your father  and kept all his precept  and done accord unto all that he hath command you  35  19 therefor thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand befor me for ever  36  1 and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord  say  36  2 take thee a roll of a book  and write therein all the word that i have spoken unto thee against israel  and against judah  and against all the nation  from the day i spake unto thee  from the day of josiah  even unto this day  36  3 it may be that the hous of judah will hear all the evil which i purpos to do unto them  that they may return everi man from his evil way  that i may forgiv their iniqu and their sin  36  4 then jeremiah call baruch the son of neriah  and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the lord  which he had spoken unto him  upon a roll of a book  36  5 and jeremiah command baruch  say  i am shut up  i cannot go into the hous of the lord  36  6 therefor go thou  and read in the roll  which thou hast written from my mouth  the word of the lord in the ear of the peopl in the lord  s hous upon the fast day  and also thou shalt read them in the ear of all judah that come out of their citi  36  7 it may be they will present their supplic befor the lord  and will return everi one from his evil way  for great is the anger and the furi that the lord hath pronounc against this peopl  36  8 and baruch the son of neriah did accord to all that jeremiah the prophet command him  read in the book the word of the lord in the lord  s hous  36  9 and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah  in the ninth month  that they proclaim a fast befor the lord to all the peopl in jerusalem  and to all the peopl that came from the citi of judah unto jerusalem  36  10 then read baruch in the book the word of jeremiah in the hous of the lord  in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe  in the higher court  at the entri of the new gate of the lord  s hous  in the ear of all the peopl  36  11 when michaiah the son of gemariah  the son of shaphan  had heard out of the book all the word of the lord  36  12 then he went down into the king  s hous  into the scribe  s chamber  and  lo  all the princ sat there  even elishama the scribe  and delaiah the son of shemaiah  and elnathan the son of achbor  and gemariah the son of shaphan  and zedekiah the son of hananiah  and all the princ  36  13 then michaiah declar unto them all the word that he had heard  when baruch read the book in the ear of the peopl  36  14 therefor all the princ sent jehudi the son of nethaniah  the son of shelemiah  the son of cushi  unto baruch  say  take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ear of the peopl  and come  so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand  and came unto them  36  15 and they said unto him  sit down now  and read it in our ear  so baruch read it in their ear  36  16 now it came to pass  when they had heard all the word  they were afraid both one and other  and said unto baruch  we will sure tell the king of all these word  36  17 and they ask baruch  say  tell us now  how didst thou write all these word at his mouth  36  18 then baruch answer them  he pronounc all these word unto me with his mouth  and i wrote them with ink in the book  36  19 then said the princ unto baruch  go  hide thee  thou and jeremiah  and let no man know where ye be  36  20 and they went in to the king into the court  but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe  and told all the word in the ear of the king  36  21 so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll  and he took it out of elishama the scribe  s chamber  and jehudi read it in the ear of the king  and in the ear of all the princ which stood besid the king  36  22 now the king sat in the winterhous in the ninth month  and there was a fire on the hearth burn befor him  36  23 and it came to pass  that when jehudi had read three or four leav  he cut it with the penknif  and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth  until all the roll was consum in the fire that was on the hearth  36  24 yet they were not afraid  nor rent their garment  neither the king  nor ani of his servant that heard all these word  36  25 nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercess to the king that he would not burn the roll  but he would not hear them  36  26 but the king command jerahmeel the son of hammelech  and seraiah the son of azriel  and shelemiah the son of abdeel  to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet  but the lord hid them  36  27 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah  after that the king had burn the roll  and the word which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah  say  36  28 take thee again anoth roll  and write in it all the former word that were in the first roll  which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burn  36  29 and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah  thus saith the lord  thou hast burn this roll  say  whi hast thou written therein  say  the king of babylon shall certain come and destroy this land  and shall caus to ceas from thenc man and beast  36  30 therefor thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah  he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david  and his dead bodi shall be cast out in the day to the heat  and in the night to the frost  36  31 and i will punish him and his seed and his servant for their iniqu  and i will bring upon them  and upon the inhabit of jerusalem  and upon the men of judah  all the evil that i have pronounc against them  but they hearken not  36  32 then took jeremiah anoth roll  and gave it to baruch the scribe  the son of neriah  who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burn in the fire  and there were ad besid unto them mani like word  37  1 and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim  whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah  37  2 but neither he  nor his servant  nor the peopl of the land  did hearken unto the word of the lord  which he spake by the prophet jeremiah  37  3 and zedekiah the king sent jehuc the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah  say  pray now unto the lord our god for us  37  4 now jeremiah came in and went out among the peopl  for they had not put him into prison  37  5 then pharaoh  s armi was come forth out of egypt  and when the chaldean that besieg jerusalem heard tide of them  they depart from jerusalem  37  6 then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah say  37  7 thus saith the lord  the god of israel  thus shall ye say to the king of judah  that sent you unto me to enquir of me  behold  pharaoh  s armi  which is come forth to help you  shall return to egypt into their own land  37  8 and the chaldean shall come again  and fight against this citi  and take it  and burn it with fire  37  9 thus saith the lord  deceiv not yourselv  say  the chaldean shall sure depart from us  for they shall not depart  37  10 for though ye had smitten the whole armi of the chaldean that fight against you  and there remain but wound men among them  yet should they rise up everi man in his tent  and burn this citi with fire  37  11 and it came to pass  that when the armi of the chaldean was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh  s armi  37  12 then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin  to separ himself thenc in the midst of the peopl  37  13 and when he was in the gate of benjamin  a captain of the ward was there  whose name was irijah  the son of shelemiah  the son of hananiah  and he took jeremiah the prophet  say  thou fallest away to the chaldean  37  14 then said jeremiah  it is fals  i fall not away to the chaldean  but he hearken not to him  so irijah took jeremiah  and brought him to the princ  37  15 wherefor the princ were wroth with jeremiah  and smote him  and put him in prison in the hous of jonathan the scribe  for they had made that the prison  37  16 when jeremiah was enter into the dungeon  and into the cabin  and jeremiah had remain there mani day  37  17 then zedekiah the king sent  and took him out  and the king ask him secret in his hous  and said  is there ani word from the lord  and jeremiah said  there is  for  said he  thou shalt be deliv into the hand of the king of babylon  37  18 moreov jeremiah said unto king zedekiah  what have i offend against thee  or against thi servant  or against this peopl  that ye have put me in prison  37  19 where are now your prophet which prophesi unto you  say  the king of babylon shall not come against you  nor against this land  37  20 therefor hear now  i pray thee  o my lord the king  let my supplic  i pray thee  be accept befor thee  that thou caus me not to return to the hous of jonathan the scribe  lest i die there  37  21 then zedekiah the king command that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison  and that they should give him daili a piec of bread out of the baker  street  until all the bread in the citi were spent  thus jeremiah remain in the court of the prison  38  1 then shephatiah the son of mattan  and gedaliah the son of pashur  and jucal the son of shelemiah  and pashur the son of malchiah  heard the word that jeremiah had spoken unto all the peopl  say  38  2 thus saith the lord  he that remaineth in this citi shall die by the sword  by the famin  and by the pestil  but he that goeth forth to the chaldean shall live  for he shall have his life for a prey  and shall live  38  3 thus saith the lord  this citi shall sure be given into the hand of the king of babylon  s armi  which shall take it  38  4 therefor the princ said unto the king  we beseech thee  let this man be put to death  for thus he weakeneth the hand of the men of war that remain in this citi  and the hand of all the peopl  in speak such word unto them  for this man seeketh not the welfar of this peopl  but the hurt  38  5 then zedekiah the king said  behold  he is in your hand  for the king is not he that can do ani thing against you  38  6 then took they jeremiah  and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech  that was in the court of the prison  and they let down jeremiah with cord  and in the dungeon there was no water  but mire  so jeremiah sunk in the mire  38  7 now when ebedmelech the ethiopian  one of the eunuch which was in the king  s hous  heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon  the king then sit in the gate of benjamin  38  8 ebedmelech went forth out of the king  s hous  and spake to the king say  38  9 my lord the king  these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet  whom they have cast into the dungeon  and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is  for there is no more bread in the citi  38  10 then the king command ebedmelech the ethiopian  say  take from henc thirti men with thee  and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon  befor he die  38  11 so ebedmelech took the men with him  and went into the hous of the king under the treasuri  and took thenc old cast clout and old rotten rag  and let them down by cord into the dungeon to jeremiah  38  12 and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah  put now these old cast clout and rotten rag under thine armhol under the cord  and jeremiah did so  38  13 so they drew up jeremiah with cord  and took him up out of the dungeon  and jeremiah remain in the court of the prison  38  14 then zedekiah the king sent  and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entri that is in the hous of the lord  and the king said unto jeremiah  i will ask thee a thing  hide noth from me  38  15 then jeremiah said unto zedekiah  if i declar it unto thee  wilt thou not sure put me to death  and if i give thee counsel  wilt thou not hearken unto me  38  16 so zedekiah the king sware secret unto jeremiah  say  as the lord liveth  that made us this soul  i will not put thee to death  neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thi life  38  17 then said jeremiah unto zedekiah  thus saith the lord  the god of host  the god of israel  if thou wilt assur go forth unto the king of babylon  s princ  then thi soul shall live  and this citi shall not be burn with fire  and thou shalt live  and thine hous  38  18 but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon  s princ  then shall this citi be given into the hand of the chaldean  and they shall burn it with fire  and thou shalt not escap out of their hand  38  19 and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah  i am afraid of the jew that are fallen to the chaldean  lest they deliv me into their hand  and they mock me  38  20 but jeremiah said  they shall not deliv thee  obey  i beseech thee  the voic of the lord  which i speak unto thee  so it shall be well unto thee  and thi soul shall live  38  21 but if thou refus to go forth  this is the word that the lord hath shew me  38  22 and  behold  all the women that are left in the king of judah  s hous shall be brought forth to the king of babylon  s princ  and those women shall say  thi friend have set thee on  and have prevail against thee  thi feet are sunk in the mire  and they are turn away back  38  23 so they shall bring out all thi wive and thi children to the chaldean  and thou shalt not escap out of their hand  but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon  and thou shalt caus this citi to be burn with fire  38  24 then said zedekiah unto jeremiah  let no man know of these word  and thou shalt not die  38  25 but if the princ hear that i have talk with thee  and they come unto thee  and say unto thee  declar unto us now what thou hast said unto the king  hide it not from us  and we will not put thee to death  also what the king said unto thee  38  26 then thou shalt say unto them  i present my supplic befor the king  that he would not caus me to return to jonathan  s hous  to die there  38  27 then came all the princ unto jeremiah  and ask him  and he told them accord to all these word that the king had command  so they left off speak with him  for the matter was not perceiv  38  28 so jeremiah abod in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken  and he was there when jerusalem was taken  39  1 in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah  in the tenth month  came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his armi against jerusalem  and they besieg it  39  2 and in the eleventh year of zedekiah  in the fourth month  the ninth day of the month  the citi was broken up  39  3 and all the princ of the king of babylon came in  and sat in the middl gate  even nergalsharez  samgarnebo  sarsechim  rabsari  nergalsharez  rabmag  with all the residu of the princ of the king of babylon  39  4 and it came to pass  that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them  and all the men of war  then they fled  and went forth out of the citi by night  by the way of the king  s garden  by the gate betwixt the two wall  and he went out the way of the plain  39  5 but the chaldean  armi pursu after them  and overtook zedekiah in the plain of jericho  and when they had taken him  they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath  where he gave judgment upon him  39  6 then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah befor his eye  also the king of babylon slew all the nobl of judah  39  7 moreov he put out zedekiah  s eye  and bound him with chain  to carri him to babylon  39  8 and the chaldean burn the king  s hous  and the hous of the peopl  with fire  and brake down the wall of jerusalem  39  9 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carri away captiv into babylon the remnant of the peopl that remain in the citi  and those that fell away  that fell to him  with the rest of the peopl that remain  39  10 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the peopl  which had noth  in the land of judah  and gave them vineyard and field at the same time  39  11 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charg concern jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard  say  39  12 take him  and look well to him  and do him no harm  but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee  39  13 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent  and nebushasban  rabsari  and nergalsharez  rabmag  and all the king of babylon  s princ  39  14 even they sent  and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison  and commit him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  that he should carri him home  so he dwelt among the peopl  39  15 now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  while he was shut up in the court of the prison  say  39  16 go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian  say  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will bring my word upon this citi for evil  and not for good  and they shall be accomplish in that day befor thee  39  17 but i will deliv thee in that day  saith the lord  and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid  39  18 for i will sure deliv thee  and thou shalt not fall by the sword  but thi life shall be for a prey unto thee  becaus thou hast put thi trust in me  saith the lord  40  1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord  after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah  when he had taken him be bound in chain among all that were carri away captiv of jerusalem and judah  which were carri away captiv unto babylon  40  2 and the captain of the guard took jeremiah  and said unto him  the lord thi god hath pronounc this evil upon this place  40  3 now the lord hath brought it  and done accord as he hath said  becaus ye have sin against the lord  and have not obey his voic  therefor this thing is come upon you  40  4 and now  behold  i loos thee this day from the chain which were upon thine hand  if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon  come  and i will look well unto thee  but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon  forbear  behold  all the land is befor thee  whither it seemeth good and conveni for thee to go  thither go  40  5 now while he was not yet gone back  he said  go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the citi of judah  and dwell with him among the peopl  or go wheresoev it seemeth conveni unto thee to go  so the captain of the guard gave him victual and a reward  and let him go  40  6 then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah  and dwelt with him among the peopl that were left in the land  40  7 now when all the captain of the forc which were in the field  even they and their men  heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land  and had commit unto him men  and women  and children  and of the poor of the land  of them that were not carri away captiv to babylon  40  8 then they came to gedaliah to mizpah  even ishmael the son of nethaniah  and johanan and jonathan the son of kareah  and seraiah the son of tanhumeth  and the son of ephai the netophathit  and jezaniah the son of a maachathit  they and their men  40  9 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men  say  fear not to serv the chaldean  dwell in the land  and serv the king of babylon  and it shall be well with you  40  10 as for me  behold  i will dwell at mizpah  to serv the chaldean  which will come unto us  but ye  gather ye wine  and summer fruit  and oil  and put them in your vessel  and dwell in your citi that ye have taken  40  11 likewis when all the jew that were in moab  and among the ammonit  and in edom  and that were in all the countri  heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah  and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  40  12 even all the jew return out of all place whither they were driven  and came to the land of judah  to gedaliah  unto mizpah  and gather wine and summer fruit veri much  40  13 moreov johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc that were in the field  came to gedaliah to mizpah  40  14 and said unto him  dost thou certain know that baali the king of the ammonit hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee  but gedaliah the son of ahikam believ them not  40  15 then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secret say  let me go  i pray thee  and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah  and no man shall know it  wherefor should he slay thee  that all the jew which are gather unto thee should be scatter  and the remnant in judah perish  40  16 but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah  thou shalt not do this thing  for thou speakest fals of ishmael  41  1 now it came to pass in the seventh month  that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama  of the seed royal  and the princ of the king  even ten men with him  came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah  and there they did eat bread togeth in mizpah  41  2 then aros ishmael the son of nethaniah  and the ten men that were with him  and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword  and slew him  whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land  41  3 ishmael also slew all the jew that were with him  even with gedaliah  at mizpah  and the chaldean that were found there  and the men of war  41  4 and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah  and no man knew it  41  5 that there came certain from shechem  from shiloh  and from samaria  even fourscor men  have their beard shaven  and their cloth rent  and have cut themselv  with offer and incens in their hand  to bring them to the hous of the lord  41  6 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them  weep all along as he went  and it came to pass  as he met them  he said unto them  come to gedaliah the son of ahikam  41  7 and it was so  when they came into the midst of the citi  that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them  and cast them into the midst of the pit  he  and the men that were with him  41  8 but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael  slay us not  for we have treasur in the field  of wheat  and of barley  and of oil  and of honey  so he forbar  and slew them not among their brethren  41  9 now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodi of the men  whom he had slain becaus of gedaliah  was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel  and ishmael the son of nethaniah fill it with them that were slain  41  10 then ishmael carri away captiv all the residu of the peopl that were in mizpah  even the king  s daughter  and all the peopl that remain in mizpah  whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam  and ishmael the son of nethaniah carri them away captiv  and depart to go over to the ammonit  41  11 but when johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc that were with him  heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done  41  12 then they took all the men  and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah  and found him by the great water that are in gibeon  41  13 now it came to pass  that when all the peopl which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc that were with him  then they were glad  41  14 so all the peopl that ishmael had carri away captiv from mizpah cast about and return  and went unto johanan the son of kareah  41  15 but ishmael the son of nethaniah escap from johanan with eight men  and went to the ammonit  41  16 then took johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc that were with him  all the remnant of the peopl whom he had recov from ishmael the son of nethaniah  from mizpah  after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam  even mighti men of war  and the women  and the children  and the eunuch  whom he had brought again from gibeon  41  17 and they depart  and dwelt in the habit of chimham  which is by bethlehem  to go to enter into egypt  41  18 becaus of the chaldean  for they were afraid of them  becaus ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam  whom the king of babylon made governor in the land  42  1 then all the captain of the forc  and johanan the son of kareah  and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah  and all the peopl from the least even unto the greatest  came near  42  2 and said unto jeremiah the prophet  let  we beseech thee  our supplic be accept befor thee  and pray for us unto the lord thi god  even for all this remnant   for we are left but a few of mani  as thine eye do behold us  42  3 that the lord thi god may shew us the way wherein we may walk  and the thing that we may do  42  4 then jeremiah the prophet said unto them  i have heard you  behold  i will pray unto the lord your god accord to your word  and it shall come to pass  that whatsoev thing the lord shall answer you  i will declar it unto you  i will keep noth back from you  42  5 then they said to jeremiah  the lord be a true and faith wit between us  if we do not even accord to all thing for the which the lord thi god shall send thee to us  42  6 whether it be good  or whether it be evil  we will obey the voic of the lord our god  to whom we send thee  that it may be well with us  when we obey the voic of the lord our god  42  7 and it came to pass after ten day  that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah  42  8 then call he johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc which were with him  and all the peopl from the least even to the greatest  42  9 and said unto them  thus saith the lord  the god of israel  unto whom ye sent me to present your supplic befor him  42  10 if ye will still abid in this land  then will i build you  and not pull you down  and i will plant you  and not pluck you up  for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you  42  11 be not afraid of the king of babylon  of whom ye are afraid  be not afraid of him  saith the lord  for i am with you to save you  and to deliv you from his hand  42  12 and i will shew merci unto you  that he may have merci upon you  and caus you to return to your own land  42  13 but if ye say  we will not dwell in this land  neither obey the voic of the lord your god  42  14 say  no  but we will go into the land of egypt  where we shall see no war  nor hear the sound of the trumpet  nor have hunger of bread  and there will we dwell  42  15 and now therefor hear the word of the lord  ye remnant of judah  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  if ye wholli set your face to enter into egypt  and go to sojourn there  42  16 then it shall come to pass  that the sword  which ye fear  shall overtak you there in the land of egypt  and the famin  whereof ye were afraid  shall follow close after you there in egypt  and there ye shall die  42  17 so shall it be with all the men that set their face to go into egypt to sojourn there  they shall die by the sword  by the famin  and by the pestil  and none of them shall remain or escap from the evil that i will bring upon them  42  18 for thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  as mine anger and my furi hath been pour forth upon the inhabit of jerusalem  so shall my furi be pour forth upon you  when ye shall enter into egypt  and ye shall be an execr  and an astonish  and a curs  and a reproach  and ye shall see this place no more  42  19 the lord hath said concern you  o ye remnant of judah  go ye not into egypt  know certain that i have admonish you this day  42  20 for ye dissembl in your heart  when ye sent me unto the lord your god  say  pray for us unto the lord our god  and accord unto all that the lord our god shall say  so declar unto us  and we will do it  42  21 and now i have this day declar it to you  but ye have not obey the voic of the lord your god  nor ani thing for the which he hath sent me unto you  42  22 now therefor know certain that ye shall die by the sword  by the famin  and by the pestil  in the place whither ye desir to go and to sojourn  43  1 and it came to pass  that when jeremiah had made an end of speak unto all the peopl all the word of the lord their god  for which the lord their god had sent him to them  even all these word  43  2 then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah  and johanan the son of kareah  and all the proud men  say unto jeremiah  thou speakest fals  the lord our god hath not sent thee to say  go not into egypt to sojourn there  43  3 but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us  for to deliv us into the hand of the chaldean  that they might put us to death  and carri us away captiv into babylon  43  4 so johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc  and all the peopl  obey not the voic of the lord  to dwell in the land of judah  43  5 but johanan the son of kareah  and all the captain of the forc  took all the remnant of judah  that were return from all nation  whither they had been driven  to dwell in the land of judah  43  6 even men  and women  and children  and the king  s daughter  and everi person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  and jeremiah the prophet  and baruch the son of neriah  43  7 so they came into the land of egypt  for they obey not the voic of the lord  thus came they even to tahpanh  43  8 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanh  say  43  9 take great stone in thine hand  and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln  which is at the entri of pharaoh  s hous in tahpanh  in the sight of the men of judah  43  10 and say unto them  thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon  my servant  and will set his throne upon these stone that i have hid  and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them  43  11 and when he cometh  he shall smite the land of egypt  and deliv such as are for death to death  and such as are for captiv to captiv  and such as are for the sword to the sword  43  12 and i will kindl a fire in the hous of the god of egypt  and he shall burn them  and carri them away captiv  and he shall array himself with the land of egypt  as a shepherd putteth on his garment  and he shall go forth from thenc in peac  43  13 he shall break also the imag of bethshemesh  that is in the land of egypt  and the hous of the god of the egyptian shall he burn with fire  44  1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the jew which dwell in the land of egypt  which dwell at migdol  and at tahpanh  and at noph  and in the countri of pathro  say  44  2 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem  and upon all the citi of judah  and  behold  this day they are a desol  and no man dwelleth therein  44  3 becaus of their wicked which they have commit to provok me to anger  in that they went to burn incens  and to serv other god  whom they knew not  neither they  ye  nor your father  44  4 howbeit i sent unto you all my servant the prophet  rise earli and send them  say  oh  do not this abomin thing that i hate  44  5 but they hearken not  nor inclin their ear to turn from their wicked  to burn no incens unto other god  44  6 wherefor my furi and mine anger was pour forth  and was kindl in the citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem  and they are wast and desol  as at this day  44  7 therefor now thus saith the lord  the god of host  the god of israel  wherefor commit ye this great evil against your soul  to cut off from you man and woman  child and suckl  out of judah  to leav you none to remain  44  8 in that ye provok me unto wrath with the work of your hand  burn incens unto other god in the land of egypt  whither ye be gone to dwell  that ye might cut yourselv off  and that ye might be a curs and a reproach among all the nation of the earth  44  9 have ye forgotten the wicked of your father  and the wicked of the king of judah  and the wicked of their wive  and your own wicked  and the wicked of your wive  which they have commit in the land of judah  and in the street of jerusalem  44  10 they are not humbl even unto this day  neither have they fear  nor walk in my law  nor in my statut  that i set befor you and befor your father  44  11 therefor thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  behold  i will set my face against you for evil  and to cut off all judah  44  12 and i will take the remnant of judah  that have set their face to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there  and they shall all be consum  and fall in the land of egypt  they shall even be consum by the sword and by the famin  they shall die  from the least even unto the greatest  by the sword and by the famin  and they shall be an execr  and an astonish  and a curs  and a reproach  44  13 for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt  as i have punish jerusalem  by the sword  by the famin  and by the pestil  44  14 so that none of the remnant of judah  which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there  shall escap or remain  that they should return into the land of judah  to the which they have a desir to return to dwell there  for none shall return but such as shall escap  44  15 then all the men which knew that their wive had burn incens unto other god  and all the women that stood by  a great multitud  even all the peopl that dwelt in the land of egypt  in pathro  answer jeremiah  say  44  16 as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord  we will not hearken unto thee  44  17 but we will certain do whatsoev thing goeth forth out of our own mouth  to burn incens unto the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offer unto her  as we have done  we  and our father  our king  and our princ  in the citi of judah  and in the street of jerusalem  for then had we plenti of victual  and were well  and saw no evil  44  18 but sinc we left off to burn incens to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offer unto her  we have want all thing  and have been consum by the sword and by the famin  44  19 and when we burn incens to the queen of heaven  and pour out drink offer unto her  did we make her cake to worship her  and pour out drink offer unto her  without our men  44  20 then jeremiah said unto all the peopl  to the men  and to the women  and to all the peopl which had given him that answer  say  44  21 the incens that ye burn in the citi of judah  and in the street of jerusalem  ye  and your father  your king  and your princ  and the peopl of the land  did not the lord rememb

in his statut  nor in his testimoni  therefor this evil is happen unto you  as at this day  44  24 moreov jeremiah said unto all the peopl  and to all the women  hear the word of the lord  all judah that are in the land of egypt  44  25 thus saith the lord of host  the god of israel  say  ye and your wive have both spoken with your mouth  and fulfil with your hand  say  we will sure perform our vow that we have vow  to burn incens to the queen of heaven  and to pour out drink offer unto her  ye will sure accomplish your vow  and sure perform your vow  44  26 therefor hear ye the word of the

word of jeremiah  52  1 zedekiah was one and twenti year old when he began to reign  and he reign eleven year in jerusalem  and his mother  s name was hamut the daughter of jeremiah of libnah  52  2 and he did that which was evil in the eye of the lord  accord to all that jehoiakim had done  52  3 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah  till he had cast them out from his presenc  that zedekiah rebel against the king of babylon  52  4 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign  in the tenth month  in the tenth day of the month  that nebuchadrezzar king

the fourth month  in the ninth day of the month  the famin was sore in the citi  so that there was no bread for the peopl of the land  52  7 then the citi was broken up  and all the men of war fled  and went forth out of the citi by night by the way of the gate between the two wall  which was by the king  s garden   now the chaldean were by the citi round about  and they went by the way of the plain  52  8 but the armi of the chaldean pursu after the king  and overtook zedekiah in the plain of jericho  and all his armi was scatter from him  52  9 then they took the king  and carri him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath  where he gave judgment upon him  52  10 and the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah befor his eye  he slew also all the princ of judah in riblah  52  11 then he put out the eye of zedekiah  and the king of babylon bound him in chain  and carri him to babylon  and put him in prison till the day of his death  52  12 now in the fifth month  in the tenth day of the month  which was the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  came nebuzaradan  captain of the guard  which serv the king of babylon  into jerusalem  52  13 and burn

vinedress and for husbandmen  52  17 also the pillar of brass that were in the hous of the lord  and the base  and the brasen sea that was in the hous of the lord  the chaldean brake  and carri all the brass of them to babylon  52  18 the caldron also  and the shovel  and the snuffer  and the bowl  and the spoon  and all the vessel of brass wherewith they minist  took they away  52  19 and the bason  and the firepan  and the bowl  and the caldron  and the candlestick  and the spoon  and the cup  that which was of gold in gold  and that which was of silver in silver  took the captain of the guard away  52  20 the two pillar  one sea  and twelv brasen bull that were under the base  which king solomon had made in the hous of the lord  the brass of all these vessel was without weight  52  21 and concern the pillar  the height of one pillar was eighteen cubit  and a fillet of twelv cubit did compass it  and the thick thereof was four finger  it was hollow  52  22 and a chapit of brass was upon it  and the height of one chapit was five cubit  with network and pomegran upon the chapit round about  all of brass  the second pillar also and the pomegran were like unto these  52  23 and there were nineti and six pomegran on a side  and all the pomegran upon the network were an hundr round about  52  24 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest  and zephaniah the second priest  and the three keeper of the door  52  25 he took also out of the citi an eunuch  which had the charg of the men of war  and seven men of them that were near the king  s person  which were found in the citi  and the princip scribe of the host  who muster the peopl of the land  and threescor men of the peopl of the land  that were found in the midst of the citi  52  26 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them  and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah  52  27 and the king of babylon smote them  and put them to death in riblah in the land of hamath  thus judah was carri away captiv out of his own land  52  28 this is the peopl whom nebuchadrezzar carri away captiv  in the seventh year three thousand jew and three and twenti  52  29 in the

whither the spirit was to go  they went  and they turn not when they went  1  13 as for the like of the live creatur  their appear was like burn coal of fire  and like the appear of lamp  it went up and down among the live creatur  and the fire was bright  and out of the fire went forth lightn  1  14 and the live creatur ran and return as the appear of a flash of lightn  1  15 now as i beheld the

 the wheel were lift up  1  20 whithersoev the spirit was to go  they went  thither was their spirit to go  and the wheel were lift up over against them  for the spirit of the live creatur was in the

was in the wheel  1  22 and the like of the firmament upon the head of the live creatur was as the colour of the terribl crystal  stretch forth over their head abov  1  23 and under the firmament were their wing straight  the one toward the other  everi one had two  which cover on this side  and everi one had two  which cover on that side  their bodi  1  24 and when they went  i heard the nois of their wing  like the nois of great water  as the voic of the almighti  the voic of speech  as the nois of an host  when they stood  they let down their wing  1  25 and there was a voic from the firmament that was over their head  when they stood  and had let down their wing  1  26 and abov the firmament that was over their head was the like of a throne  as the appear of a sapphir stone  and upon the like of the throne was the like as the appear of a man abov upon it  1  27 and i saw as the colour of amber  as the appear of fire round about within it  from the appear of his loin even

of a strang speech and of an hard languag  whose word thou canst not understand  sure  had i sent thee to them  they would have hearken unto thee  3  7 but the hous of israel will not hearken unto thee  for they will not hearken unto me  for all the hous of israel are impud and hardheart  3  8 behold  i have made thi face strong against their face  and thi forehead strong against their forehead  3  9 as an adam harder than flint have i made thi forehead  fear them not  neither be dismay at their look  though they be a rebelli hous  3  10 moreov he said unto me  son of man  all my word that i

lord god  whether they will hear  or whether they will forbear  3  12 then the spirit took me up  and i heard behind me a voic of a great rush  say  bless be the glori of the lord from his place  3  13 i heard also the nois of the wing of the live creatur that touch one anoth  and the nois of the wheel over against them  and a nois of a great rush  3  14 so the spirit lift me up  and took me away  and i went in bitter  in the heat of my spirit  but the hand of the lord was strong upon me  3  15 then i came to them of the captiv at telabib  that dwelt by the river of chebar  and i sat where they sat  and remain there astonish among them seven day  3  16 and it came to pass at the end of seven day  that the word of the lord came unto me  say  3  17 son of man  i have made thee a watchman

and a thick cloud of incens went up  8  12 then said he unto me  son of man  hast thou seen what the ancient of the hous of israel do in the dark  everi man in the chamber of his imageri  for they say  the lord seeth us not  the lord hath forsaken the earth  8  13 he said also unto me  turn thee yet again  and thou shalt see greater abomin that they do  8  14 then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord  s hous which was toward the north  and  behold  there sat women weep for tammuz  8  15 then said he unto me  hast thou seen this  o son of man  turn thee yet again  and thou shalt see greater abomin than these  8  16 and he brought me into the inner court of the lord  s hous  and  behold  at the door of the templ of the lord  between the porch and the altar  were about five and twenti men  with their back toward the templ of the lord  and their face toward the east  and they worship the sun toward the east  8  17 then he said unto me  hast thou seen this  o son of man  is it a light thing to the hous of judah that they commit the abomin which they commit here  for they have fill the land with violenc  and have return to provok me to anger  and  lo  they put the branch to

inkhorn by his side  9  4 and the lord said unto him  go through the midst of the citi  through the midst of jerusalem  and set a mark upon the forehead of the men that sigh and that cri for all the abomin that be done in the midst thereof  9  5 and to the other he said in mine hear  go ye after him through the citi  and smite  let not your eye spare  neither have ye piti  9  6 slay utter old and young  both maid  and littl children  and women  but come not near ani man upon whom is the mark  and begin at my sanctuari  then they began at the ancient men which were befor the hous  9  7 and he said unto them  defil the hous  and fill the court with the slain  go ye forth  and they went forth  and slew in the citi  9  8 and it came to pass  while they were slay them  and i was left  that i fell upon my face  and cri  and said  ah lord god  wilt thou destroy all the residu of israel in thi pour out of thi furi upon jerusalem  9  9 then said he unto me  the iniqu of the hous of israel and judah is exceed great  and the land is full of blood  and the citi full of pervers  for they say  the lord hath forsaken the earth  and the lord seeth not  9  10 and as for me also  mine eye shall not spare  neither will i have piti  but i will recompens their way upon their head  9  11 and  behold  the man cloth with linen  which had the inkhorn by his side  report the matter  say  i have done as thou hast command me  10  1 then i look  and  behold  in the firmament that was abov the head of the cherubim there appear over them as it were a sapphir stone  as the appear of the like of a throne  10  2 and he spake unto the man cloth with linen  and said  go in between the wheel  even under the cherub  and fill thine hand with coal of fire from between the cherubim  and scatter them over the citi  and he went in in my sight  10  3 now the cherubim stood on the right side of the hous  when the man went in  and the cloud fill the inner court  10  4 then the glori of the lord went up from the cherub  and stood over the threshold of the hous  and the hous was fill with the cloud  and the court was full of the bright of the lord  s glori  10  5 and the sound of the cherubim  wing was heard even to the outer court  as the voic of the almighti god when he speaketh  10  6 and it came to pass  that when he had command the man cloth with linen  say  take fire from between the wheel  from between the cherubim  then he went in  and stood besid the wheel  10  7 and one cherub stretch forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim  and took thereof  and put it into the hand of him that was cloth with linen  who took it  and went out  10  8 and there appear in the cherubim the form of a man  s hand under their wing  10  9 and when i look  behold the four wheel by the cherubim  one wheel by one cherub  and anoth wheel by anoth cherub  and the appear of the wheel was as the colour of a beryl stone  10  10 and as for their appear  they four had one like  as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel  10  11 when they went  they went upon their four side  they turn not as they went  but to the place whither the head look they follow it  they turn not as they went  10  12 and their whole bodi  and their back  and their hand  and their wing  and the wheel  were full of eye round about  even the wheel that they four had  10  13 as for the wheel  it was cri unto them in my hear  o wheel  10  14 and everi one had four face  the first face was the face of a cherub  and the second face was the face of a man  and the third the face of a lion  and the fourth the face of an eagl  10  15 and the cherubim were lift up  this is the live creatur that i saw by the river of chebar  10  16 and when the cherubim went  the wheel went by them  and when the cherubim lift up their wing to mount up from the earth  the same wheel also turn not from besid them  10  17 when they stood  these stood  and when they were lift up  these lift up themselv also  for the spirit of the live creatur was in them  10  18 then the glori of the lord depart from off the threshold of the hous  and stood over the cherubim  10  19 and the cherubim lift up their wing  and mount up from the earth in my sight  when they went out  the wheel also were besid them  and everi one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord  s hous  and the glori of the god of israel was over them abov  10  20 this is the live creatur that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar  and i knew that they were the cherubim  10  21 everi one had four face apiec  and everi one four wing  and the like of the hand of a man was under their wing  10  22 and the like of their face was the same face which i saw by the river of chebar  their appear and themselv  they went everi one straight forward  11  1 moreov the spirit lift me up  and brought me unto the east gate of the lord  s hous  which looketh eastward  and behold at the door of the gate five and twenti men  among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur  and pelatiah the son of benaiah  princ of the peopl  11  2 then said he unto me  son of man  these are the men that devis mischief  and give wick counsel in this citi  11  3 which say  it is not near  let us build hous  this citi is the caldron  and we be the flesh  11  4 therefor prophesi against them  prophesi  o son of man  11  5 and the spirit of the lord fell upon me  and said unto me  speak  thus saith the lord  thus have ye said  o hous of israel  for i know the thing that come into your mind  everi one of them  11  6 ye have multipli your slain in this citi  and ye have fill the street thereof with the slain  11  7 therefor thus saith the lord god  your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it  they are the flesh  and this citi is the caldron  but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it  11  8 ye have fear the sword  and i will bring a sword upon you  saith the lord god  11  9 and i will bring you out of the midst thereof  and deliv you into the hand of stranger  and will execut judgment among you  11  10 ye shall fall by the sword  i will judg you in the border of israel  and ye shall know that i am the lord  11  11 this citi shall not be your caldron  neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof  but i will judg you in the border of israel  11  12 and ye shall know that i am the lord  for ye have not walk in my statut  neither execut my judgment  but have done after the manner of the heathen that are round about you  11  13 and it came to pass  when i prophesi  that pelatiah the son of benaiah die  then fell i down upon my face  and cri with a loud voic  and said  ah lord god  wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel  11  14 again the word of the lord came unto me  say  11  15 son of man  thi brethren  even thi brethren  the men of thi kindr  and all the hous of israel wholli  are they unto whom the inhabit of jerusalem have said  get you far from the lord  unto us is this land given in possess  11  16 therefor say  thus saith the lord god  although i have cast them far off among the heathen  and although i have scatter them among the countri  yet will i be to them as a littl sanctuari in the countri where they shall come  11  17 therefor say  thus saith the lord god  i will even gather you from the peopl  and assembl you out of the countri where ye have been scatter  and i will give you the land of israel  11  18 and they shall come thither  and they shall take away all the detest thing thereof and all the abomin thereof from thenc  11  19 and i will give them one heart  and i will put a new spirit within you  and i will take the stoni heart out of their flesh  and will give them an heart of flesh  11  20 that they may walk in my statut  and keep mine ordin  and do them  and they shall be my peopl  and i will be their god  11  21 but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detest thing and their abomin  i will recompens their way upon their own head  saith the lord god  11  22 then did the cherubim lift up their wing  and the wheel besid them  and the glori of the god of israel was over them abov  11  23 and the glori of the lord went up from the midst of the citi  and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the citi  11  24 afterward the spirit took me up  and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea  to them of the captiv  so the vision that i had seen went up from me  11  25 then i spake unto them of the captiv all the thing that the lord had shew me  12  1 the word of the lord also came unto me  say  12  2 son of man  thou dwellest in the midst of a rebelli hous  which have eye to see  and see not  they have ear to hear  and hear not  for they are a rebelli hous  12  3 therefor  thou son of man  prepar thee stuff for remov  and remov by day in their sight  and thou shalt remov from thi place to anoth place in their sight  it may be they will consid  though they be a rebelli hous  12  4 then shalt thou bring forth thi stuff by day in their sight  as stuff for remov  and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight  as they that go forth into captiv  12  5 dig thou through the wall in their sight  and carri out therebi  12  6 in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thi shoulder  and carri it forth in the twilight  thou shalt cover thi face  that thou see not the ground  for i have set thee for a sign unto the hous of israel  12  7 and i did so as i was command  i brought forth my stuff by day  as stuff for captiv  and in the even i dig through the wall with mine hand  i brought it forth in the twilight  and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight  12  8 and in the morn came the word of the lord unto me  say  12  9 son of man  hath not the hous of israel  the rebelli hous  said unto thee  what doest thou  12  10 say thou unto them  thus saith the lord god  this burden concerneth the princ in jerusalem  and all the hous of israel that are among them  12  11 say  i am your sign  like as i have done  so shall it be done unto them  they shall remov and go into captiv  12  12 and the princ that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight  and shall go forth  they shall dig through the wall to carri out therebi  he shall cover his face  that he see not the ground with his eye  12  13 my net also will i spread upon him  and he shall be taken in my snare  and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldean  yet shall he not see it  though he shall die there  12  14 and i will scatter toward everi wind all that are about him to help him  and all his band  and i will draw out the sword after them  12  15 and they shall know that i am the lord  when i shall scatter them among the nation  and dispers them in the countri  12  16 but i will leav a few men of them from the sword  from the famin  and from the pestil  that they may declar all their abomin among the heathen whither they come  and they shall know that i am the lord  12  17 moreov the word of the lord came to me  say  12  18 son of man  eat thi bread with quak  and drink thi water with trembl and with care  12  19 and say unto the peopl of the land  thus saith the lord god of the inhabit of jerusalem  and of the land of israel  they shall eat their bread with care  and drink their water with astonish  that her land may be desol from all that is therein  becaus of the violenc of all them that dwell therein  12  20 and the citi that are inhabit shall be laid wast  and the land shall be desol  and ye shall know that i am the lord  12  21 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  12  22 son of man  what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel  say  the day are prolong  and everi vision faileth  12  23 tell them therefor  thus saith the lord god  i will make this proverb to ceas  and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel  but say unto them  the day are at hand  and the effect of everi vision  12  24 for there shall be no more ani vain vision nor flatter divin within the hous of israel  12  25 for i am the lord  i will speak  and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass  it shall be no more prolong  for in your day  o rebelli hous  will i say the word  and will perform it  saith the lord god  12  26 again the word of the lord came to me  say  12  27 son of man  behold  they of the hous of israel say  the vision that he seeth is for mani day to come  and he prophesieth of the time that are far off  12  28 therefor say unto them  thus saith the lord god  there shall none of my word be prolong ani more  but the word which i have spoken shall be done  saith the lord god  13  1 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  13  2 son of man  prophesi against the prophet of israel that prophesi  and say thou unto them that prophesi out of their own heart  hear ye the word of the lord  13  3 thus saith the lord god  woe unto the foolish prophet  that follow their own spirit  and have seen noth  13  4 o israel  thi prophet are like the fox in the desert  13  5 ye have not gone up into the gap  neither made up the hedg for the hous of israel to stand in the battl in the day of the lord  13  6 they have seen vaniti and lie divin  say  the lord saith  and the lord hath not sent them  and they have made other to hope that they would confirm the word  13  7 have ye not seen a vain vision  and have ye not spoken a lie divin  wherea ye say  the lord saith it  albeit i have not spoken  13  8 therefor thus saith the lord god  becaus ye have spoken vaniti  and seen lie  therefor  behold  i am against you  saith the lord god  13  9 and mine hand shall be upon the prophet that see vaniti  and that divin lie  they shall not be in the assembl of my peopl  neither shall they be written in the write of the hous of israel  neither shall they enter into the land of israel  and ye shall know that i am the lord god  13  10 becaus  even becaus they have seduc my peopl  say  peac  and there was no peac  and one built up a wall  and  lo  other daub it with untemp morter  13  11 say unto them which daub it with untemp morter  that it shall fall  there shall be an overflow shower  and ye  o great hailston  shall fall  and a stormi wind shall rend it  13  12 lo  when the wall is fallen  shall it not be said unto you  where is the daub wherewith ye have daub it  13  13 therefor thus saith the lord god  i will even rend it with a stormi wind in my furi  and there shall be an overflow shower in mine anger  and great hailston in my furi to consum it  13  14 so will i break down the wall that ye have daub with untemp morter  and bring it down to the ground  so that the foundat thereof shall be discov  and it shall fall  and ye shall be consum in the midst thereof  and ye shall know that i am the lord  13  15 thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall  and upon them that have daub it with untemp morter  and will say unto you  the wall is no more  neither they that daub it  13  16 to wit  the prophet of israel which prophesi concern jerusalem  and which see vision of peac for her  and there is no peac  saith the lord god  13  17 likewis  thou son of man  set thi face against the daughter of thi peopl  which prophesi out of their own heart  and prophesi thou against them  13  18 and say  thus saith the lord god  woe to the women that sew pillow to all armhol  and make kerchief upon the head of everi statur to hunt soul  will ye hunt the soul of my peopl  and will ye save the soul aliv that come unto you  13  19 and will ye pollut me among my peopl for hand of barley and for piec of bread  to slay the soul that should not die  and to save the soul aliv that should not live  by your lie to my peopl that hear your lie  13  20 wherefor thus saith the lord god  behold  i am against your pillow  wherewith ye there hunt the soul to make them fli  and i will tear them from your arm  and will let the soul go  even the soul that ye hunt to make them fli  13  21 your kerchief also will i tear  and deliv my peopl out of your hand  and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunt  and ye shall know that i am the lord  13  22 becaus with lie ye have made the heart of the righteous sad  whom i have not made sad  and strengthen the hand of the wick  that he should not return from his wick way  by promis him life  13  23 therefor ye shall see no more vaniti  nor divin divin  for i will deliv my peopl out of your hand  and ye shall know that i am the lord  14  1 then came certain of the elder of israel unto me  and sat befor me  14  2 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  14  3 son of man  these men have set up their idol in their heart  and put the stumblingblock of their iniqu befor their face  should i be enquir of at all by them  14  4 therefor speak unto them  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  everi man of the hous of israel that setteth up his idol in his heart  and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniqu befor his face  and cometh to the prophet  i the lord will answer him that cometh accord to the multitud of his idol  14  5 that i may take the hous of israel in their own heart  becaus they are all estrang from me through their idol  14  6 therefor say unto the hous of israel  thus saith the lord god  repent  and turn yourselv from your idol  and turn away your face from all your abomin  14  7 for everi one of the hous of israel  or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel  which separateth himself from me  and setteth up his idol in his heart  and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniqu befor his face  and cometh to a prophet to enquir of him concern me  i the lord will answer him by myself  14  8 and i will set my face against that man  and will make him a sign and a proverb  and i will cut him off from the midst of my peopl  and ye shall know that i am the lord  14  9 and if the prophet be deceiv when he hath spoken a thing  i the lord have deceiv that prophet  and i will stretch out my hand upon him  and will destroy him from the midst of my peopl israel  14  10 and they shall bear the punish of their iniqu  the punish of the prophet shall be even as the punish of him that seeketh unto him  14  11 that the hous of israel may go no more astray from me  neither be pollut ani more with all their transgress  but that they may be my peopl  and i may be their god  saith the lord god  14  12 the word of the lord came again to me  say  14  13 son of man  when the land sinneth against me by trespass grievous  then will i stretch out mine hand upon it  and will break the staff of the bread thereof  and will send famin upon it  and will cut off man and beast from it  14  14 though these three men  noah  daniel  and job  were in it  they should deliv but their own soul by their righteous  saith the lord god  14  15 if i caus noisom beast to pass through the land  and they spoil it  so that it be desol  that no man may pass through becaus of the beast  14  16 though these three men were in it  as i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliv neither son nor daughter  they onli shall be deliv  but the land shall be desol  14  17 or if i bring a sword upon that land  and say  sword  go through the land  so that i cut off man and beast from it  14  18 though these three men were in it  as i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliv neither son nor daughter  but they onli shall be deliv themselv  14  19 or if i send a pestil into that land  and pour out my furi upon it in blood  to cut off from it man and beast  14  20 though noah  daniel  and job were in it  as i live  saith the lord god  they shall deliv neither son nor daughter  they shall but deliv their own soul by their righteous  14  21 for thus saith the lord god  how much more when i send my four sore judgment upon jerusalem  the sword  and the famin  and the noisom beast  and the pestil  to cut off from it man and beast  14  22 yet  behold  therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth  both son and daughter  behold  they shall come forth unto you  and ye shall see their way and their do  and ye shall be comfort concern the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem  even concern all that i have brought upon it  14  23 and they shall comfort you  when ye see their way and their do  and ye shall know that i have not done without caus all that i have done in it  saith the lord god  15  1 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  15  2 son of man  what is the vine tree more than ani tree  or than a branch which is among the tree of the forest  15  3 shall wood be taken thereof to do ani work  or will men take a pin of it to hang ani vessel thereon  15  4 behold  it is cast into the fire for fuel  the fire devoureth both the end of it  and the midst of it is burn  is it meet for ani work  15  5 behold  when it was whole  it was meet for no work  how much less shall it be meet yet for ani work  when the fire hath devour it  and it is burn  15  6 therefor thus saith the lord god  as the vine tree among the tree of the forest  which i have given to the fire for fuel  so will i give the inhabit of jerusalem  15  7 and i will set my face against them  they shall go out from

heathen for thi beauti  for it was perfect through my comeli  which i had put upon thee  saith the lord god  16  15 but thou didst trust in thine own beauti  and playedst the harlot becaus of thi renown  and pouredst out thi fornic on everi one that pass by  his it was  16  16 and of thi garment thou didst take  and deckedst thi high place with diver colour  and playedst the harlot thereupon  the like thing shall not come  neither shall it be so  16  17 thou hast also taken thi fair jewel of my gold and of my silver  which i had given thee  and madest to thyself imag of men  and didst

thine heart  saith the lord god  see thou doest all these thing  the work of an imperi whorish woman  16  31 in that thou buildest thine emin place in the head of everi way  and makest thine high place in everi street  and hast not been as an harlot  in that thou scornest hire  16  32 but as a wife that committeth adulteri  which taketh stranger instead of her husband  16  33 they give gift to all whore  but thou givest thi gift to all thi lover  and hirest them  that they may come unto thee on everi side for thi whoredom  16  34 and the contrari is in thee from other women in thi whoredom  wherea none followeth thee to commit whoredom  and in that thou givest a reward  and no reward is given unto thee  therefor thou art contrari  16  35 wherefor  o harlot  hear the word of the lord  16  36 thus saith the lord god  becaus thi filthi was pour out  and thi naked discov through thi whoredom with thi lover  and with all the idol of thi abomin  and by the blood of thi children  which thou

youth  but hast fret me in all these thing  behold  therefor i also will recompens thi way upon thine head  saith the lord god  and thou shalt not commit this lewd abov all thine abomin  16  44 behold  everi one that useth proverb shall use this proverb against thee  say  as is the mother  so is her daughter  16  45 thou art thi mother  s daughter  that lotheth her husband and her children  and thou art the sister of thi sister  which loth their husband and their children  your mother was an hittit  and your father an amorit  16  46 and thine elder sister is samaria  she and her daughter that dwell at thi left hand  and thi younger sister  that dwelleth at thi right hand  is sodom and her daughter  16  47 yet hast thou not walk after their way  nor done after their abomin  but  as if that were a veri littl thing  thou wast corrupt more than they in all thi way  16  48 as i live  saith the lord god  sodom thi sister hath not done  she nor her daughter  as thou hast done  thou and thi daughter  16  49 behold  this was the iniqu of thi sister sodom  pride  ful of bread  and abund of idl was in her and in her daughter  neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needi  16  50 and they were haughti  and commit abomin befor me  therefor i took them away as i saw good  16  51 neither hath samaria commit half of thi sin  but thou hast multipli thine abomin more than they  and hast justifi thi sister in all thine abomin which thou hast done  16  52 thou also  which hast judg thi sister  bear thine own shame for thi sin that thou hast commit more abomin than they  they are more righteous than thou  yea  be thou confound also  and bear thi shame  in that thou hast justifi thi sister  16  53 when i shall bring again their captiv  the captiv of sodom and her daughter  and the captiv of samaria and her daughter  then will i bring again the captiv of thi captiv in the midst of them  16  54 that thou mayest bear thine own shame  and mayest be confound in all that thou hast done  in that thou art a comfort unto them  16  55 when thi sister  sodom and her daughter  shall return to their former estat  and samaria and her daughter shall return to their former estat  then thou and thi daughter shall return to your former estat  16  56 for thi sister sodom was not mention by thi mouth in the day of thi pride  16  57 befor thi wicked was discov  as at the time of thi reproach of the daughter of syria  and all that are round about her  the daughter of the philistin  which despis thee round about  16  58 thou hast born thi lewd and thine abomin  saith the lord  16  59 for thus saith the lord god  i will even deal with thee as thou hast done  which hast despis the oath in break the coven  16  60 nevertheless i will rememb my coven with thee in the day of thi youth  and i will establish unto thee an everlast coven  16  61 then thou shalt rememb thi way  and be asham  when thou shalt receiv thi sister  thine elder and thi younger  and i will give them unto

mouth ani more becaus of thi shame  when i am pacifi toward thee for all that thou hast done  saith the lord god  17  1 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  17  2 son of man  put forth a riddl  and speak a parabl unto the hous of israel  17  3 and say  thus saith the lord god  a great eagl with great wing  longwing  full of feather  which had diver colour  came unto lebanon  and took the highest branch of the cedar  17  4 he crop off the top of his young twig  and carri it into a land of traffick  he set it in a citi of merchant  17  5 he took also of the seed of the land  and plant it in a fruit field  he place it by great water  and set it as a willow tree  17  6 and it grew  and becam a spread vine of low statur  whose branch turn toward him  and the root thereof were under him  so it becam a vine  and brought forth branch  and shot forth sprig  17  7 there was also anoth great eagl with great wing and mani feather  and  behold  this vine did bend her root toward him  and shot forth her branch toward him  that he might water it by the furrow of her plantat  17  8 it was plant in a good soil by great water  that it might bring forth branch  and that it might bear fruit  that it might be a good vine  17  9 say thou  thus saith the lord god  shall it prosper  shall he not pull up the root thereof  and cut off the fruit thereof  that it wither  it shall wither in all the leav of her spring  even without great power or mani peopl to pluck it up by the root thereof  17  10 yea  behold  be plant  shall it prosper  shall it not utter wither  when the east wind toucheth it  it shall wither in the furrow where it grew  17  11 moreov the word of the lord came unto me  say  17  12 say now to the rebelli hous  know ye not what these thing mean  tell them  behold  the king of babylon is come to jerusalem  and hath taken the king thereof  and the princ thereof  and led them with him to babylon  17  13 and hath taken of the king  s seed  and made a coven with him  and hath taken an oath of him  he hath also taken the mighti of the land  17  14 that the kingdom might be base  that it might not lift itself up  but that by keep of his coven it might stand  17  15 but he rebel against him in send his ambassador into egypt  that they might give him hors and much peopl  shall he prosper  shall he escap that doeth such thing  or shall he break the coven  and be deliv  17  16 as i live  saith the lord god  sure in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king  whose oath he despis  and whose coven he brake  even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die  17  17 neither shall pharaoh with his mighti armi and great compani make for him in the war  by cast up mount  and build fort  to cut off mani person  17  18 see he despis the oath by break the coven  when  lo  he had given his hand  and hath done all these thing  he shall not escap  17  19 therefor thus saith the lord god  as i live  sure mine oath that he hath despis  and my coven that he hath broken  even it will i recompens upon his own head  17  20 and i will spread my net upon him  and he shall be taken in my snare  and i will bring him to babylon  and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespass against me  17  21 and all his fugit with all his band shall fall by the sword  and they that remain shall be scatter toward all wind  and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it  17  22 thus saith the lord god  i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar  and will set it  i will crop off from the top of his young twig a tender one  and will plant it upon an high mountain and emin  17  23 in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it  and it shall bring forth bough  and bear fruit  and be a good cedar  and under it shall dwell all fowl of everi wing  in the shadow of the branch thereof shall they dwell  17  24 and all the tree of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree  have exalt the low tree  have dri up the green tree  and have made the dri tree to flourish  i the lord have spoken and have done it  18  1 the word of the lord came unto me again  say  18  2 what mean ye  that ye use this proverb concern the land of israel  say  the father have eaten sour grape  and the children  s teeth are set on edg  18  3 as i live  saith the lord god  ye shall not have occas ani more to use this proverb in israel  18  4 behold  all soul are mine  as the soul of the father  so also the soul of the son is mine  the soul that sinneth  it shall die  18  5 but if a man be just  and do that which is law and right  18  6 and hath not eaten upon the mountain  neither hath lift up his eye to the idol of the hous of israel  neither hath defil his neighbour  s wife  neither hath come near to a menstruous woman  18  7 and hath not oppress ani  but hath restor to the debtor his pledg  hath spoil none by violenc  hath given his bread to the hungri  and hath cover the nake with a garment  18  8 he that hath not given forth upon usuri  neither hath taken ani increas  that hath withdrawn his hand from iniqu  hath execut true judgment between man and man  18  9 hath walk in my statut  and hath kept my judgment  to deal truli  he is just  he shall sure live  saith the lord god  18  10 if he beget a son that is a robber  a shedder of blood  and that doeth the like to ani one of these thing  18  11 and that doeth not ani of those duti  but even hath eaten upon the mountain  and defil his neighbour  s wife  18  12 hath oppress the poor and needi  hath spoil by violenc  hath not restor the pledg  and hath lift up his eye to the idol  hath commit abomin  18  13 hath given forth upon usuri  and hath taken increas  shall he then live  he shall not live  he hath done all these abomin  he shall sure die  his blood shall be upon him  18  14 now  lo  if he beget a son  that seeth all his father  s sin which he hath done  and considereth  and doeth not such like  18  15 that hath not eaten upon the mountain  neither hath lift up his eye to the idol of the hous of israel  hath not defil his neighbour  s wife  18  16 neither hath oppress ani  hath not withholden the pledg  neither hath spoil by violenc  but hath given his bread to the hungri  and hath cover the nake with a garment  18  17 that hath taken off his hand from the poor  that hath not receiv usuri nor increas  hath execut my judgment  hath walk in my statut  he shall not die for the iniqu of his father  he shall sure live  18  18 as for his father  becaus he cruelli oppress  spoil his brother by violenc  and did that which is not good among his peopl  lo  even he shall die in his iniqu  18  19 yet say ye  whi  doth not the son bear the iniqu of the father  when the son hath done that which is law and right  and hath kept all my statut  and hath done them  he shall sure live  18  20 the soul that sinneth  it shall die  the son shall not bear the iniqu of the father  neither shall the father bear the iniqu of the son  the righteous of the righteous shall be upon him  and the wicked of the wick shall be upon him  18  21 but if the wick will turn from all his sin that he hath commit  and keep all my statut  and do that which is law and right  he shall sure live  he shall not die  18  22 all his transgress that he hath commit  they shall not be mention unto him  in his righteous that he hath done he shall live  18  23 have i ani pleasur at all that the wick should die  saith the lord god  and not that he should return from his way  and live  18  24 but when the righteous turneth away from his righteous  and committeth iniqu  and doeth accord to all the abomin that the wick man doeth  shall he live  all his righteous that he hath done shall not be mention  in his trespass that he hath trespass  and in his sin that he hath sin  in them shall he die  18  25 yet ye say  the way of the lord is not equal  hear now  o hous of israel  is not my way equal  are not your way unequ  18  26 when a righteous man turneth away from his righteous  and committeth iniqu  and dieth in them  for his iniqu that he hath done shall he die  18  27 again  when the wick man turneth away from his wicked that he hath commit  and doeth that which is law and right  he shall save his soul aliv  18  28 becaus he considereth  and turneth away from all his transgress that he hath commit  he shall sure live  he shall not die  18  29 yet saith the hous of israel  the way of the lord is not equal  o hous of israel  are not my way equal  are not your way unequ  18  30 therefor i will judg you  o hous of israel  everi one accord to his way  saith the lord god  repent  and turn yourselv from all your transgress  so iniqu shall not be your ruin  18  31 cast away from you all your transgress  wherebi ye have transgress  and make you a new heart and a new spirit  for whi will ye die  o hous of israel  18  32 for i have no pleasur in the death of him that dieth  saith the lord god  wherefor turn yourselv  and live ye  19  1 moreov take thou up a lament for the princ of israel  19  2 and say  what is thi mother  a lioness  she lay down among lion  she nourish her whelp among young lion  19  3 and she brought up one of her whelp  it becam a young lion  and it learn to catch the prey  it devour men  19  4 the nation also heard of him  he was taken in their pit  and they brought him with chain unto the land of egypt  19  5 now when she saw that she had wait  and her hope was lost  then she took anoth of her whelp  and made him a young lion  19  6 and he went up and down among the lion  he becam a young lion  and learn to catch the prey  and devour men  19  7 and he knew their desol palac  and he laid wast their citi  and the land was desol  and the ful thereof  by the nois of his roar  19  8 then the nation set against him on everi side from the provinc  and spread their net over him  he was taken in their pit  19  9 and they put him in ward in chain  and brought him to the king of babylon  they brought him into hold  that his voic should no more be heard upon the mountain of israel  19  10 thi mother is like a vine in thi blood  plant by the water  she was fruit and full of branch by reason of mani water  19  11 and she had strong rod for the sceptr of them that bare rule  and her statur was exalt among the thick branch  and she appear in her height with the multitud of her branch  19  12 but she was pluck up in furi  she was cast down to the ground  and the east wind dri up her fruit  her strong rod were broken and wither  the fire consum them  19  13 and now she is plant in the wilder  in a dri and thirsti ground  19  14 and fire is gone out of a rod of her branch  which hath devour her fruit  so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptr to rule  this is a lament  and shall be for a lament  20  1 and it came to pass in the seventh year  in the fifth month  the tenth day of the month  that certain of the elder of israel came to enquir of the lord  and sat befor me  20  2 then came the word of the lord unto me  say  20  3 son of man  speak unto the elder of israel  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  are ye come to enquir of me  as i live  saith the lord god  i will not be enquir of by you  20  4 wilt thou judg them  son of man  wilt thou judg them  caus them to know the abomin of their father  20  5 and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  in the day when i chose israel  and lift up mine hand unto the seed of the hous of jacob  and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt  when i lift up mine hand unto them  say  i am the lord your god  20  6 in the day that i lift up mine hand unto them  to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espi for them  flow with milk and honey  which is the glori of all land  20  7 then said i unto them  cast ye away everi man the abomin of his eye  and defil not yourselv with the idol of egypt  i am the lord your god  20  8 but they rebel against me  and would not hearken unto me  they did not everi man cast away the abomin of their eye  neither did they forsak the idol of egypt  then i said  i will pour out my furi upon them  to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt  20  9 but i wrought for my name  s sake  that it should not be pollut befor the heathen  among whom they were  in whose sight i made myself known unto them  in bring them forth out of the land of egypt  20  10 wherefor i caus them to go forth out of the land of egypt  and brought them into the wilder  20  11 and i gave them my statut  and shew them my judgment  which if a man do  he shall even live in them  20  12 moreov also i gave them my sabbath  to be a sign between me and them  that they might know that i am the lord that sanctifi them  20  13 but the hous of israel rebel against me in the wilder  they walk not in my statut  and they despis my judgment  which if a man do  he shall even live in them  and my sabbath they great pollut  then i said  i would pour out my furi upon them in the wilder  to consum them  20  14 but i wrought for my name  s sake  that it should not be pollut befor the heathen  in whose sight i brought them out  20  15 yet also i lift up my hand unto them in the wilder  that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them  flow with milk and honey  which is the glori of all land  20  16 becaus they despis my judgment  and walk not in my statut  but pollut my sabbath  for their heart went after their idol  20  17 nevertheless mine eye spare them from destroy them  neither did i make an end of them in the wilder  20  18 but i said unto their children in the wilder  walk ye not in the statut of your father  neither observ their judgment  nor defil yourselv with their idol  20  19 i am the lord your god  walk in my statut  and keep my judgment  and do them  20  20 and hallow my sabbath  and they shall be a sign between me and you  that ye may know that i am the lord your god  20  21 notwithstand the children rebel against me  they walk not in my statut  neither kept my judgment to do them  which if a man do  he shall even live in them  they pollut my sabbath  then i said  i would pour out my furi upon them  to accomplish my anger against them in the wilder  20  22 nevertheless i withdrew mine hand  and wrought for my name  s sake  that it should not be pollut in the sight of the heathen  in whose sight i brought them forth  20  23 i lift up mine hand unto them also in the wilder  that i would scatter them among the heathen  and dispers them through the countri  20  24 becaus they had not execut my judgment  but had despis my statut  and had pollut my sabbath  and their eye were after their father  idol  20  25 wherefor i gave them also statut that were not good  and judgment wherebi they should not live  20  26 and i pollut them in their own gift  in that they caus to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb  that i might make them desol  to the end that they might know that i am the lord  20  27 therefor  son of man  speak unto the hous of israel  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god  yet in this your father have blasphem me  in that they have commit a trespass against me  20  28 for when i had brought them into the land  for the which i lift up mine hand to give it to them  then they saw everi high hill  and all the thick tree  and they offer there their sacrific  and there they present the provoc of their offer  there also they made their sweet savour  and pour out there their drink offer  20  29 then i said unto them  what is the high place whereunto ye go  and the name whereof is call bamah unto this day  20  30 wherefor say unto the hous of israel  thus saith the lord god  are ye pollut after the manner of your father  and commit ye whoredom after their abomin  20  31 for when ye offer your gift  when ye make your son to pass through the fire  ye pollut yourselv with all your idol  even unto this day  and shall i be enquir of by you  o hous of israel  as i live  saith the lord god  i will not be enquir of by you  20  32 and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all  that ye say  we will be as the heathen  as the famili of the countri  to serv wood and stone  20  33 as i live  saith the lord god  sure with a mighti hand  and with a stretch out arm  and with furi pour out  will i rule over you  20  34 and i will bring you out from the peopl  and will gather you out of the countri wherein ye are scatter  with a mighti hand  and with a stretch out arm  and with furi pour out  20  35 and i will bring you into the wilder of the peopl  and there will i plead with you face to face  20  36 like as i plead with your father in the wilder of the land of egypt  so will i plead with you  saith the lord god  20  37 and i will caus you to pass under the rod  and i will bring you into the bond of the coven  20  38 and i will purg out from among you the rebel  and them that transgress against me  i will bring them forth out of the countri where they sojourn  and they shall not enter into the land of israel  and ye shall know that i am the lord  20  39 as for you  o hous of israel  thus saith the lord god  go ye  serv ye everi one his idol  and hereaft also  if ye will not hearken unto me  but pollut ye my holi name no more with your gift  and with your idol  20  40 for in mine holi mountain  in the mountain of the height of israel  saith the lord god  there shall all the hous of israel  all of them in the land  serv me  there will i accept them  and there will i requir your offer  and the firstfruit of your oblat  with all your holi thing  20  41 i will accept you with your sweet savour  when i bring you out from the peopl  and gather you out of the countri wherein ye have been scatter  and i will be sanctifi in you befor the heathen  20  42 and ye shall know that i am the lord  when i shall bring you into the land of israel  into the countri for the which i lift up mine hand to give it to your father  20  43 and there shall ye rememb your way  and all your do  wherein ye have been defil  and ye shall loth yourselv in your own sight for all your evil that ye have commit  20

recompens upon their head  saith the lord god  23  1 the word of the lord came again unto me  say  23  2 son of man  there were two women  the daughter of one mother  23  3 and they commit whoredom in egypt  they commit whoredom in their youth  there were their breast press  and there they bruis the teat of their virgin  23  4 and the name of them were aholah the elder  and aholibah her sister  and they were mine  and they bare son and daughter  thus were their name  samaria is aholah  and jerusalem aholibah  23  5 and aholah play the harlot when she was mine  and she dote on her lover  on the assyrian her neighbour  23  6 which were cloth with blue  captain and ruler  all of them desir young men  horsemen ride upon hors  23  7 thus she commit her whoredom with them  with all them that were the chosen men of assyria  and with all on whom she dote  with all their idol she defil herself  23  8 neither left she her whoredom brought from egypt  for in her youth they lay with her  and they bruis the breast of her virgin  and pour their whoredom upon her  23  9 wherefor i have deliv her into the hand of her lover  into the hand of the assyrian  upon whom she dote  23  10 these discov her naked  they took her son and her daughter  and slew her with the sword  and she becam famous among women  for they had execut judgment upon her  23  11 and when her sister aholibah saw this  she was more corrupt in her inordin love than she  and in her whoredom more than her sister in her whoredom  23  12 she dote upon the assyrian her neighbour  captain and ruler cloth most gorgeous  horsemen ride upon hors  all of them desir young men  23  13 then i saw that she was defil  that they took both one way  23  14 and that she increas her whoredom  for when she saw men pourtray upon the wall  the imag of the chaldean pourtray with vermilion  23  15 gird with girdl upon their loin  exceed in dy attir upon their head  all of them princ to look to  after the manner of the babylonian of chaldea  the land of their nativ  23  16 and as soon as she saw them with her eye  she dote upon them  and sent messeng unto them into chaldea  23  17 and the babylonian came to her into the bed of love  and they defil her with their whoredom  and she was pollut with them  and her mind was alien from them  23  18 so she discov her whoredom  and discov her naked  then my mind was alien from her  like as my mind was alien from her sister  23  19 yet she multipli her whoredom  in call to remembr the day of her youth  wherein she had play the harlot in the land of egypt  23  20 for she dote upon their paramour  whose flesh is as the flesh of ass  and whose issu is like the issu of hors  23  21 thus thou calledst to remembr the lewd of thi youth  in bruis thi teat by the egyptian for the pap of thi youth  23  22 therefor  o aholibah  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will rais up thi lover against thee  from whom thi mind is alien  and i will bring them against thee on everi side  23  23 the babylonian  and all the chaldean  pekod  and shoa  and koa  and all the assyrian with them  all of them desir young men  captain and ruler  great lord and renown  all of them ride upon hors  23  24 and they shall come against thee with chariot  wagon  and wheel  and with an assembl of peopl  which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about  and i will set judgment befor them  and they shall judg thee accord to their judgment  23  25 and i will set my jealousi against thee  and they shall deal furious with thee  they shall take away thi nose and thine ear  and thi remnant shall fall by the sword  they shall take thi son and thi daughter  and thi residu shall be devour by the fire  23  26 they shall also strip thee out of thi cloth  and take away thi fair jewel  23  27 thus will i make thi lewd to ceas from thee  and thi whoredom brought from the land of egypt  so that thou shalt not lift up thine eye unto them  nor rememb egypt ani more  23  28 for thus saith the lord god  behold  i will deliv thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest  into the hand of them from whom thi mind is alien  23  29 and they shall deal with thee hate  and shall take away all thi labour  and shall leav thee nake and bare  and the naked of thi whoredom shall be discov  both thi lewd and thi whoredom  23  30 i will do these thing unto thee  becaus thou hast gone a whore after the heathen  and becaus thou art pollut with their idol  23  31 thou hast walk in the way of thi sister  therefor will i give her cup into thine hand  23  32 thus saith the lord god  thou shalt drink of thi sister  s cup deep and larg  thou shalt be laugh to scorn and had in deris  it containeth much  23  33 thou shalt be fill with drunken and sorrow  with the cup of astonish and desol  with the cup of thi sister samaria  23  34 thou shalt even drink it and suck it out  and thou shalt break the sherd thereof  and pluck off thine own breast  for i have spoken it  saith the lord god  23  35 therefor thus saith the lord god  becaus thou hast forgotten me  and cast me behind thi back  therefor bear thou also thi lewd and thi whoredom  23  36 the lord said moreov unto me  son of man  wilt thou judg aholah and aholibah  yea  declar unto them their abomin  23  37 that they have commit adulteri  and blood is in their hand  and with their idol have they commit adulteri  and have also caus their son  whom they bare unto me  to pass for them through the fire  to devour them  23  38 moreov this they have done unto me  they have defil my sanctuari in the same day  and have profan my sabbath  23  39 for when they had slain their children to their idol  then they came the same day into my sanctuari to profan it  and  lo  thus have they done in the midst of mine hous  23  40 and furthermor  that ye have sent for men to come from far  unto whom a messeng was sent  and  lo  they came  for whom thou didst wash thyself  paintedst thi eye  and deckedst thyself with ornament  23  41 and satest upon a state bed  and a tabl prepar befor it  whereupon thou hast set mine incens and mine oil  23  42 and a voic of a multitud be at eas was with her  and with the men of the common sort were brought sabean from the wilder  which put bracelet upon their hand  and beauti crown upon their head  23  43 then said i unto her that was old in adulteri  will they now commit whoredom with her  and she with them  23  44 yet they went in unto her  as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot  so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah  the lewd women  23  45 and the righteous men  they shall judg them after the manner of adulteress  and after the manner of women that shed blood  becaus they are adulteress  and blood is in their hand  23  46 for thus saith the lord god  i will bring up a compani upon them  and will give them to be remov and spoil  23  47 and the compani shall stone them with stone  and dispatch them with their sword  they shall slay their son and their daughter  and burn up their hous with fire  23  48 thus will i caus lewd to ceas out of the land  that all women may be taught not to do after your lewd  23  49 and they shall recompens your lewd upon you  and ye shall bear the sin of your idol  and ye shall know that i am the lord god  24  1 again in the ninth year  in the tenth month  in the tenth day of the month  the word of the lord came unto

say unto them  thus saith the lord god  set on a pot  set it on  and also pour water into it  24  4 gather the piec thereof into it  even everi good piec  the thigh  and the shoulder  fill it with the choic bone  24  5 take the choic of the flock  and burn also the bone under it  and make it boil well  and let them seeth the bone of it therein  24  6 wherefor thus saith the lord god  woe to the bloodi citi  to the pot whose scum is therein  and whose scum is not gone out of it  bring it out piec by piec  let no lot fall upon it  24  7 for her blood is in the midst of her  she set it upon the top of a rock  she pour it not upon the ground  to cover it with dust  24  8 that it might caus furi to come up to take vengeanc  i have set her blood upon the top of a rock  that it should not be cover  24  9 therefor thus saith the lord god  woe to the bloodi citi  i will even make the pile for fire great  24  10 heap on wood  kindl the fire  consum the flesh  and spice it well  and let the bone be burn  24  11 then set it empti upon the coal thereof  that the brass of it may be hot  and may burn  and that the filthi of it may be molten in it  that the scum of it may be consum  24  12 she hath weari herself with lie  and her great scum went not forth out of her  her scum shall be in the fire  24  13 in thi filthi is lewd  becaus i have purg thee  and thou wast not purg  thou shalt not be purg from thi filthi ani more  till i have caus my furi to rest upon thee  24  14 i the lord have spoken it  it shall come to pass  and i will do it  i will not go back  neither will i spare  neither will i repent  accord to thi way  and accord to thi do  shall they judg thee  saith the lord god  24  15 also the word of the lord came unto me  say  24  16 son of man  behold  i take away from thee the desir of thine eye with a stroke  yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep  neither shall thi tear run down  24  17 forbear to cri  make no mourn for the dead  bind the tire of thine head upon thee  and put on thi shoe upon thi feet  and cover not thi lip  and eat not the bread of men  24  18 so i spake unto the peopl in the morn  and at even my wife die  and i did in the morn as i was command  24  19 and the peopl said unto me  wilt thou not tell us what these thing are to us  that thou doest so  24  20 then i answer them  the word of the lord came unto me  say  24  21 speak unto the hous of israel  thus saith the lord god  behold  i will profan my sanctuari  the excel of your strength  the desir of your eye  and that which your soul pitieth  and your son and your daughter

upon your feet  ye shall not mourn nor weep  but ye shall pine away for your iniqu  and mourn one toward anoth  24  24 thus ezekiel is unto you a sign  accord to all that he hath done shall ye do  and when this cometh  ye shall know that i am the lord god  24  25 also  thou son of man  shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength  the joy of their glori  the desir of their eye  and that whereupon they set their mind  their son and their daughter  24  26 that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee  to caus thee to hear it with thine ear  24  27 in that day shall thi mouth be open to him which is escap  and thou shalt speak  and be no more dumb  and thou shalt be a sign unto them  and they shall know that i am the lord  25  1 the word of the lord came again

therefor thus saith the lord god  i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom  and will cut off man and beast from it  and i will make it desol from teman  and they of dedan shall fall by the sword  25  14 and i will lay my vengeanc upon edom by the hand of my peopl israel  and they shall do in edom accord to mine anger and accord to my furi  and they shall know my vengeanc  saith the lord god  25  15 thus saith the lord god  becaus the philistin have dealt by reveng  and have taken vengeanc with a despit heart  to destroy it for the old hatr  25  16 therefor thus saith the lord god  behold  i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistin  and i will cut off the cherethim  and destroy the remnant of the sea coast  25  17 and i will execut great vengeanc upon them with furious rebuk  and they shall know that i am the lord  when i shall lay my vengeanc upon them  26  1 and it came to pass in the eleventh year  in the first day of the month  that the word of the lord came unto me  say

be laid in the midst of the uncircumcis with them that are slain with the sword  even pharaoh and all his multitud  saith the lord god  33  1 again the word of the lord came unto me  say  33  2 son of man  speak to the children of thi peopl  and say unto them  when i bring the sword upon a land  if the peopl of the land take a man of their coast  and set him for their watchman  33  3 if when he seeth the sword come upon the land  he blow the trumpet  and warn the peopl  33  4 then whosoev heareth the sound of the trumpet  and taketh not warn  if the sword come  and take him away  his blood shall be upon his own head  33  5 he heard the sound of the trumpet  and took not warn  his blood shall be upon him  but he that taketh warn shall deliv his soul  33  6 but if the watchman see the sword come  and blow not the trumpet  and the peopl be not warn  if the sword come  and take ani person from among them  he is taken away in his iniqu  but his blood will i requir at the watchman  s hand  33  7 so thou  o son of man  i have set thee a watchman unto the hous of israel  therefor thou shalt hear the word at my mouth  and warn them from me  33  8 when i say unto the wick  o wick man  thou shalt sure die  if thou dost not speak to warn the wick from his way  that wick man shall die in his iniqu  but his blood will i requir at thine hand  33  9 nevertheless  if thou warn the wick of his way to turn from it  if he do not turn from his way  he shall die in his iniqu  but thou hast deliv thi soul  33  10 therefor  o thou son of man  speak unto the hous of israel  thus ye speak  say  if our transgress and our sin be upon us  and we pine away in them  how should we then live  33  11 say unto them  as i live  saith the lord god  i have no pleasur in the death of the wick  but that the wick turn from his way and live  turn ye  turn ye from your evil way  for whi will ye die  o hous of israel  33  12 therefor  thou son of man  say unto the children of thi peopl  the righteous of the righteous shall not deliv him in the day of his transgress  as for the wicked of the wick  he shall not fall therebi in the day that he turneth from his wicked  neither shall the righteous be abl to live for his righteous in the day that he sinneth  33  13 when i shall say to the righteous  that he shall sure live  if he trust to his own righteous  and commit iniqu  all his righteous shall not be rememb  but for his iniqu that he hath commit  he shall die for it  33  14 again  when i say unto the wick  thou shalt sure die  if he turn from his sin  and do that which is law and right  33  15 if the wick restor the pledg  give again that he had rob  walk in the statut of life  without commit iniqu  he shall sure live  he shall not die  33  16 none of his sin that he hath commit shall be mention unto him  he hath done that which is law and right  he shall sure live  33  17 yet the children of thi peopl say  the way of the lord is not equal  but as for them  their way is not equal  33  18 when the righteous turneth from his righteous  and committeth iniqu  he shall even die therebi  33  19 but if the wick turn from his wicked  and do that which is law and right  he shall live therebi  33  20 yet ye say  the way of the lord is not equal  o ye hous of israel  i will judg you everi one after his way  33  21 and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captiv  in the tenth month  in the fifth day of the month  that one that had escap out of jerusalem came unto me  say  the citi is smitten  33  22 now the hand of the lord was upon me in the even  afor he that was escap came  and had open my mouth  until he came to me in the morn  and my mouth was open  and i was no more dumb  33  23 then the word of the lord came unto me  say  33  24 son of man  they that inhabit those wast of the land of israel speak  say  abraham was one  and he inherit the land  but we are mani  the land is given us for inherit  33  25 wherefor say unto them  thus saith the lord god  ye eat with the blood  and lift up your eye toward your idol  and shed blood  and shall ye possess the land  33  26 ye stand upon your sword  ye work abomin  and ye defil everi one his neighbour  s wife  and shall ye possess the land  33  27 say thou thus unto them  thus saith the lord god  as i live  sure they that are in the wast shall fall by the sword  and him that is in the open field will i give to the beast to be devour  and they that be in the fort and in the cave shall die of the pestil  33  28 for i will lay the land most desol  and the pomp of her strength shall ceas  and the mountain of israel shall be desol  that none shall pass through  33  29 then shall they know that i am the lord  when i have laid the land most desol becaus of all their abomin which they have commit  33  30 also  thou son of man  the children of thi peopl still are talk against thee by the wall and in the door of the hous  and speak one to anoth  everi one to his brother  say  come  i pray you  and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord  33  31 and they come unto thee as the peopl cometh  and they sit befor thee as my peopl  and they hear thi word  but they will not do them  for with their mouth they shew much love  but their heart goeth after their covet  33  32 and  lo  thou art unto them as a veri love song of one that hath a pleasant voic  and can play well on an instrument  for they hear thi word  but they do them not  33  33 and when this cometh to pass   lo  it will come  then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them  34  1 and the word of the lord came unto me  say  34  2 son of man  prophesi against the shepherd of israel  prophesi  and say unto them  thus saith the lord god unto the shepherd  woe be to the shepherd of israel that do feed themselv  should not the shepherd feed the flock  34  3 ye eat the fat  and ye cloth you with the wool  ye kill them that are fed  but ye feed not the flock  34  4 the diseas have ye not strengthen  neither have ye heal that which was sick  neither have ye bound up that which was broken  neither have ye brought again that which was driven away  neither have ye sought that which was lost  but with forc and with cruelti have ye rule them  34  5 and they were scatter  becaus there is no shepherd  and they becam meat to all the beast of the field  when they were scatter  34  6 my sheep wander through all the mountain  and upon everi high hill  yea  my flock was scatter upon all the face of the earth  and none did search or seek after them  34  7 therefor  ye shepherd  hear the word of the lord  34  8 as i live  saith the lord god  sure becaus my flock becam a prey  and my flock becam meat to everi beast of the field  becaus there was no shepherd  neither did my shepherd search for my flock  but the shepherd fed themselv  and fed not my flock  34  9 therefor  o ye shepherd  hear the word of the lord  34  10 thus saith the lord god  behold  i am against the shepherd  and i will requir my flock at their hand  and caus them to ceas from feed the flock  neither shall the shepherd feed themselv ani more  for i will deliv my flock from their mouth  that they may not be meat for them  34  11 for thus saith the lord god  behold  i  even i  will both search my sheep  and seek them out  34  12 as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scatter  so will i seek out my sheep  and will deliv them out of all place where they have been scatter in the cloudi and dark day  34  13 and i will bring them out from the peopl  and gather them from the countri  and will bring them to their own land  and feed them upon the mountain of israel by the river  and in all the inhabit place of the countri  34  14 i will feed them in a good pastur  and upon the high mountain of israel shall their fold be  there shall they lie in a good fold  and in a fat pastur shall they feed upon the mountain of israel  34  15 i will feed my flock  and i will caus them to lie down  saith the lord god  34  16 i will seek that which was lost  and bring again that which was driven away  and will bind up that which was broken  and will strengthen that which was sick  but i will destroy the fat and the strong  i will feed them with judgment  34  17 and as for you  o my flock  thus saith the lord god  behold  i judg between cattl and cattl  between the ram and the he goat  34  18 seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pastur  but ye must tread down with your feet the residu of your pastur  and to have drunk of the deep water  but ye must foul the residu with your feet  34  19 and as for my flock  they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet  and they drink that which ye have foul with your feet  34  20 therefor thus saith the lord god unto them  behold  i  even i  will judg between the fat cattl and between the lean cattl  34  21 becaus ye have thrust with side and with shoulder  and push all the diseas with your horn  till ye have scatter them abroad  34  22 therefor will i save my flock  and they shall no more be a prey  and i will judg between cattl and cattl  34  23 and i will set up one shepherd over them  and he shall feed them  even my servant david  he shall feed them  and he shall be their shepherd  34  24 and i the lord will be their god  and my servant david a princ among them  i the lord have spoken it  34  25 and i will make with them a coven of peac  and will caus the evil beast to ceas out of the land  and they shall dwell safe in the wilder  and sleep in the wood  34  26 and i will make them and the place round about my hill a bless  and i will caus the shower to come down in his season  there shall be shower of bless  34  27 and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit  and the earth shall yield her increas  and they shall be safe in their land  and shall know that i am the lord  when i have broken the band of their yoke  and deliv them out of the hand of those that serv themselv of them  34  28 and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen  neither shall the beast of the land devour them  but they shall dwell safe  and none shall make them afraid  34  29 and i will rais up for them a plant of renown  and they shall be no more consum with hunger in the land  neither bear the shame of the heathen ani more  34  30 thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them  and that they  even the hous of israel  are my peopl  saith the lord god  34  31 and ye my flock  the flock of my pastur  are men  and i am your god  saith the lord god  35  1 moreov the word of the lord came unto me  say  35  2 son of man  set thi face against mount seir  and prophesi against it  35  3 and say unto it  thus saith the lord god  behold  o mount seir  i am against thee  and i will stretch out mine hand against thee  and i will make thee most desol  35  4 i will lay thi citi wast  and thou shalt be desol  and thou shalt know that i am the lord  35  5 becaus thou hast had a perpetu hatr  and hast shed the blood of the children of israel by the forc of the sword in the time of their calam  in the time that their iniqu had an end  35  6 therefor  as i live  saith the lord god  i will prepar thee unto blood  and blood shall pursu thee  sith thou hast not hate blood  even blood shall pursu thee  35  7 thus will i make mount seir most desol  and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth  35  8 and i will fill his mountain with his slain men  in thi hill  and in thi valley  and in all thi river  shall they fall that are slain with the sword  35  9 i will make thee perpetu desol  and thi citi shall not return  and ye shall know that i am the lord  35  10 becaus thou hast said  these two nation and these two countri shall be mine  and we will possess it  wherea the lord was there  35  11 therefor  as i live  saith the lord god  i will even do accord to thine anger  and accord to thine envi which thou hast use out of thi hatr against them  and i will make myself known among them  when i have judg thee  35  12 and thou shalt know that i am the lord  and that i have heard all thi blasphemi which thou hast spoken against the mountain of israel  say  they are laid desol  they are given us to consum  35  13 thus with your mouth ye have boast against me  and have multipli your word against me  i have heard them  35  14 thus saith the lord god  when the whole earth rejoiceth  i will make thee desol  35  15 as thou didst rejoic at the inherit of the hous of israel  becaus it was desol  so will i do unto thee  thou shalt be desol  o mount seir  and all idumea  even all of it  and they shall know that i am the lord  36  1 also  thou son of man  prophesi unto the mountain of israel  and say  ye mountain of israel  hear the word of the lord  36  2

you desol  and swallow you up on everi side  that ye might be a possess unto the residu of the heathen  and ye are taken up in the lip of talker  and are an infami of the peopl  36  4 therefor  ye mountain of israel  hear the word of the lord god  thus saith the lord god to the mountain  and to the hill  to the river  and to the valley  to the desol wast  and to the citi that are forsaken  which becam a prey and deris to the residu of the heathen that are round about  36  5 therefor thus saith the lord god  sure in the fire of my jealousi have i spoken against the residu of the heathen  and against all idumea  which have appoint my land into their possess with the joy of all their heart  with despit mind  to cast it out for a prey  36  6 prophesi therefor concern the land of israel  and say unto the mountain  and to the hill  to the river  and to the valley  thus saith the lord god  behold  i have spoken in my jealousi and in my furi  becaus ye have born the shame of the heathen  36  7 therefor thus saith the lord god  i have lift up mine hand  sure the heathen that are about you  they shall bear their shame  36  8 but ye  o mountain of israel  ye shall shoot forth your branch  and yield your fruit to my peopl of israel  for they are at hand to come  36  9 for  behold  i am for you  and i will turn unto you  and ye shall be till and sown  36  10 and i will multipli men upon

and hast bereav thi nation  36  14 therefor thou shalt devour men no more  neither bereav thi nation ani more  saith the lord god  36  15 neither will i caus men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen ani more  neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peopl ani more  neither shalt thou caus thi nation to fall ani more  saith the lord god  36  16 moreov the word of the lord came unto me

night  and  behold  the four wind of the heaven strove upon the great sea  7  3 and four great beast came up from the sea  divers one from anoth  7  4 the first was like a lion  and had eagl  s wing  i beheld till the wing thereof were pluck  and it was lift up from the earth  and made stand upon the feet as a man  and a man  s heart was given to it  7  5 and behold anoth beast  a second  like to

like a leopard  which had upon the back of it four wing of a fowl  the beast had also four head  and dominion was given to it  7  7 after this i saw in the night vision  and behold a fourth beast  dread and terribl  and strong exceed  and it had great iron teeth  it devour and brake in piec  and stamp the residu with the feet of it  and it was divers from all the beast that were befor it  and it had ten horn  7  8 i consid the horn  and  behold  there came up among them anoth littl horn  befor whom there were three of the first horn pluck up by the root  and  behold  in this horn were eye like the eye of man  and a mouth speak great thing  7  9 i beheld till the throne were cast down  and the ancient of day did sit  whose garment was white as snow  and the hair of his head like the pure wool  his throne was like the fieri flame  and his wheel as burn fire  7  10 a fieri stream issu and came forth from befor him  thousand thousand minist unto him  and ten thousand time ten thousand stood befor him  the judgment was set  and the book were open  7  11 i beheld then becaus of the voic of the great word which the horn spake  i beheld even till the beast was slain  and his bodi destroy  and given to the burn flame  7  12 as concern the rest of the beast  they had their dominion taken away  yet their live were prolong for a season and time  7  13 i saw in the night vision  and  behold  one like the son of man came with the cloud of heaven  and came to the ancient of day  and they brought him near befor him  7  14 and there was given him dominion  and glori  and a kingdom  that all peopl  nation  and languag  should serv him  his dominion is an everlast dominion  which shall not pass away  and his kingdom that which shall not be destroy  7  15 i daniel was griev in my spirit in the midst of my bodi  and the vision of my head troubl me  7  16 i came near unto one of them that stood by  and ask him the truth of all this  so he told me  and made me know the interpret of the thing  7  17 these great beast  which are four  are four king  which shall aris out of the earth  7  18 but the saint of the most high shall take the kingdom  and possess the kingdom for ever  even for ever and ever  7  19 then i would know the truth of the fourth beast  which was divers from all the other  exceed dread  whose teeth were of iron  and his nail of brass  which devour  brake in piec  and stamp the residu with his feet  7  20 and of the ten horn that were in his head  and of the other which came up  and befor whom three fell  even of that horn that had

neither did i anoint myself at all  till three whole week were fulfil  10  4 and in the four and twentieth day of the first month  as i was by the side of the great river  which is hiddekel  10  5 then i lift up mine eye  and look  and behold a certain man cloth in linen  whose loin were gird with fine gold of uphaz  10  6 his bodi also was like the beryl  and his face as the appear of lightn

branch of her root shall one stand up in his estat  which shall come with an armi  and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north  and shall deal against them  and shall prevail  11  8 and shall also carri captiv into egypt their god  with their princ  and with their precious vessel of silver and of gold  and he shall continu more year than the king of the north  11  9 so the king of

but they shall fall  11  15 so the king of the north shall come  and cast up a mount  and take the most fenc citi  and the arm of the south shall not withstand  neither his chosen peopl  neither shall there be ani strength to withstand  11  16 but he that cometh against him shall do accord to his own will  and none shall stand befor him  and he shall stand in the glorious land  which by his hand

shall stand up in his estat a raiser of tax in the glori of the kingdom  but within few day he shall be destroy  neither in anger  nor in battl  11  21 and in his estat shall stand up a vile person  to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom  but he shall come in peaceabl  and obtain the kingdom by flatteri  11  22 and with the arm of a flood shall they be overflown from befor him  and shall be broken  yea  also the princ of the coven  11  23 and after the leagu made with him he shall work deceit  for he shall come up  and shall becom strong with a small peopl  11  24 he shall enter

be stir up to battl with a veri great and mighti armi  but he shall not stand  for they shall forecast devic against him  11  26 yea  they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him  and his armi shall overflow  and mani shall fall down slain  11  27 and both of these king  heart shall be to do mischief  and they shall speak lie at one tabl  but it shall not prosper  for yet the end shall be at the time appoint  11  28 then shall he return into his land with great rich  and his heart shall be against the holi coven  and he shall do exploit  and return to his own land  11  29 at the time appoint he shall return  and come toward the south  but it shall not be as the former  or as the latter  11  30 for the ship of chittim shall come against him  therefor he shall be griev  and return  and have indign against the holi coven  so shall he do  he shall even return  and have intellig with them that forsak the holi coven  11  31 and arm shall stand on his part  and they shall pollut the sanctuari of strength  and shall take away the daili sacrific  and they shall place the abomin that maketh desol  11  32 and such as do wick against the coven shall he corrupt by flatteri  but the peopl that do know their god shall be strong  and do exploit  11  33 and they that understand among the peopl shall instruct mani  yet they shall fall by the sword  and by flame  by captiv  and by spoil  mani day  11  34 now when they shall fall  they shall be holpen with a littl help  but mani shall cleav to them with flatteri  11  35 and some of them of understand shall fall  to tri them  and to purg  and to make them white  even to the time of the end  becaus it is yet for a time appoint  11  36 and the king shall do accord to his will  and he shall exalt himself  and magnifi himself abov everi god  and shall speak marvel thing against the god of god  and shall prosper till the indign be accomplish  for that that is determin shall be done  11  37 neither shall he regard the god of his father  nor the desir of women  nor regard ani god  for he shall magnifi himself abov all  11  38 but in his estat shall he honour the god of forc  and a god whom his father knew not shall he honour with gold  and silver  and with precious stone  and pleasant thing  11  39 thus shall he do in the most strong hold with a strang god  whom he shall acknowledg and increas with glori  and he shall caus them to rule over mani  and shall divid the land for gain  11  40 and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him  and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind  with chariot  and with horsemen  and with mani ship  and he shall enter into the countri  and shall overflow and pass over  11  41 he shall enter also into the glorious land  and mani countri shall be overthrown  but these shall escap out of his hand  even edom  and moab  and the chief of the children of ammon  11  42 he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countri  and the land of egypt shall not escap  11  43 but he shall have power over the treasur of gold and of silver  and over all the precious thing of egypt  and the libyan and the ethiopian shall be at his

of his palac between the sea in the glorious holi mountain  yet he shall come to his end  and none shall help him  12  1 and at that time shall michael stand up  the great princ which standeth for the children of thi peopl  and there shall be a time of troubl  such as never was sinc there was a nation even to that same time  and at that time thi peopl shall be deliv  everi one that shall be found written in the book  12  2 and mani of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awak  some to everlast life  and some to shame and everlast contempt  12  3 and they that be wise shall shine as the bright of the firmament  and they that turn mani to righteous as the star for ever and ever  12  4 but thou  o daniel  shut up the word  and seal the book  even to the time of the end  mani shall run to and fro  and knowledg shall be increas  12  5 then i daniel look  and  behold  there stood other two  the one on this side of the bank of the river  and the other on that side of the bank of the river  12  6 and one said to the man cloth in linen  which was upon the water of the river  how long shall it be to the end of these wonder  12  7 and i heard the man cloth in linen  which was upon the water of the river  when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven  and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time  time  and an half  and when he shall have accomplish to scatter the power of the holi peopl  all these thing shall be finish  12  8 and i heard  but i understood not  then said i  o my lord  what shall be the end of these thing  12  9 and he said  go thi way  daniel  for the word are close up and seal till the time of the end  12  10 mani shall be purifi  and made white  and tri  but the wick shall do wick  and none of the wick shall understand  but the wise shall understand  12  11 and from the time that the daili sacrific shall be taken away  and the abomin that maketh desol set up  there shall be a thousand two hundr and nineti day  12  12 bless is he that waiteth  and cometh to the thousand three hundr and five and thirti day  12  13 but go thou thi way till the end be  for thou shalt rest  and stand in thi lot at the end of the day  hosea 1  1 the word of the lord that came unto hosea  the son of beeri  in the day of uzziah  jotham  ahaz  and hezekiah  king of judah  and in the day of jeroboam the son of joash  king of israel  1  2 the begin of the word of the lord by hosea  and the lord said to hosea  go  take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom  for the land hath commit great whoredom  depart from the lord  1  3 so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim  which conceiv  and bare him a son  1  4 and the lord said unto him  call his name jezreel  for yet a littl while  and i will aveng the blood of jezreel upon the hous of jehu  and will caus to ceas the kingdom of the hous of israel  1  5 and it shall come to pass at that day  that i will break the bow of israel  in the valley of jezreel  1  6 and she conceiv again  and bare a daughter  and god said unto him  call her name loruhamah  for i will no more have merci upon the hous of israel  but i will utter take them away  1  7 but i will have merci upon the hous of judah  and will save them by the lord their god  and will not save them by bow  nor by sword  nor by battl  by hors  nor by horsemen  1  8 now when she had wean loruhamah  she conceiv  and bare a son  1  9 then said god  call his name loammi  for ye are not my peopl  and i will not be your god  1  10 yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea  which cannot be measur nor number  and it shall come to pass  that in the place where it was said unto them  ye are not my peopl  there it shall be said unto them  ye are the son of the live god  1  11 then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gather togeth  and appoint themselv one head  and they shall come up out of the land  for great shall be the day of jezreel  2  1 say ye unto your brethren  ammi  and to your sister  ruhamah  2  2 plead with your mother  plead  for she is not my wife  neither am i her husband  let her therefor put away her whoredom out of her sight  and her adulteri from between her breast  2  3 lest i strip her nake  and set her as in the day that she was born  and make her as a wilder  and set her like a dri land  and slay her with thirst  2  4 and i will not have merci upon her children  for they be the children of whoredom  2  5 for their mother hath play the harlot  she that conceiv them hath done shame  for she said  i will go after my lover  that give me my bread and my water  my wool and my flax  mine oil and my drink  2  6 therefor  behold  i will hedg up thi way with thorn  and make a wall  that she shall not find her path  2  7 and she shall follow after her lover  but she shall not overtak them  and she shall seek them  but shall not find them  then shall she say  i will go and return to my first husband  for then was it better with me than now  2  8 for she did not know that i gave her corn  and wine  and oil  and multipli her silver and gold  which they prepar for baal  2  9 therefor will i return  and take away my corn in the time thereof  and my wine in the season thereof  and will recov my wool and my flax given to cover her naked  2  10 and now will i discov her lewd in the sight of her lover  and none shall deliv her out of mine hand  2  11 i will also caus all her mirth to ceas  her feast day  her new moon  and her sabbath  and all her solemn feast  2  12 and i will destroy her vine and her fig tree  whereof she hath said  these are my reward that my lover have given me  and i will make them a forest  and the beast of the field shall eat them  2  13 and i will visit upon her the day of baalim  wherein she burn incens to them  and she deck herself with her earring and her jewel  and she went after her lover  and forgat me  saith the lord  2  14 therefor  behold  i will allur her  and bring her into the wilder  and speak comfort unto her  2  15 and i will give her her vineyard from thenc  and the valley of achor for a door of hope  and she shall sing there  as in the day of her youth  and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt  2  16 and it shall be at that day  saith the lord  that thou shalt call me ishi  and shalt call me no more baali  2  17 for i will take away the name of baalim out of her mouth  and they shall no more be rememb by their name  2  18 and in that day will i make a coven for them with the beast of the field and with the fowl of heaven  and with the creep thing of the ground  and i will break the bow and the sword and the battl out of the earth  and will make them to lie down safe  2  19 and i will betroth thee unto me for ever  yea  i will betroth thee unto me in righteous  and in judgment  and in lovingkind  and in merci  2  20 i will even betroth thee unto me in faith  and thou shalt know the lord  2  21 and it shall come to pass in that day  i will hear  saith the lord  i will hear the heaven  and they shall hear the earth  2  22 and the earth shall hear the corn  and the wine  and the oil  and they shall hear jezreel  2  23 and i will sow her unto me in the earth  and i will have merci upon her that had not obtain merci  and i will say to them which were not my peopl  thou art my peopl  and they shall say  thou art my god  3  1 then said the lord unto me  go yet  love a woman belov of her friend  yet an adulteress  accord to the love of the lord toward the children of israel  who look to other god  and love flagon of wine  3  2 so i bought her to me for fifteen piec of silver  and for an homer of barley  and an half homer of barley  3  3 and i said unto her  thou shalt abid for me mani day  thou shalt not play the harlot  and thou shalt not be for anoth man  so will i also be for thee  3  4 for the children of israel shall abid mani day without a king  and without a princ  and without a sacrific  and without an imag  and without an ephod  and without teraphim  3  5 afterward shall the children of israel return  and seek the lord their god  and david their king  and shall fear the lord and his good in the latter day  4  1 hear the word of the lord  ye children of israel  for the lord hath a controversi with the inhabit of the land  becaus there is no truth  nor merci  nor knowledg of god in the land  4  2 by swear  and lie  and kill  and steal  and commit adulteri  they break out  and blood toucheth blood  4  3 therefor shall the land mourn  and everi one that dwelleth therein shall languish  with the beast of the field  and with the fowl of heaven  yea  the fish of the sea also shall be taken away  4  4 yet let no man strive  nor reprov anoth  for thi peopl are as they that strive with the priest  4  5 therefor shalt thou fall in the day  and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night  and i will destroy thi mother  4  6 my peopl are destroy for lack of knowledg  becaus thou hast reject knowledg  i will also reject thee  that thou shalt be no priest to me  see thou hast forgotten the law of thi god  i will also forget thi children  4  7 as they were increas  so they sin against me  therefor will i chang their glori into shame  4  8 they eat up the sin of my peopl  and they set their heart on their iniqu  4  9 and there shall be  like peopl  like priest  and i will punish them for their way  and reward them their do  4  10 for they shall eat  and not have enough  they shall commit whoredom  and shall not increas  becaus they have left off to take heed to the lord  4  11 whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart  4  12 my peopl ask counsel at their stock  and their staff declareth unto them  for the spirit of whoredom hath caus them to err  and they have gone a whore from under their god  4  13 they sacrific upon the top of the mountain  and burn incens upon the hill  under oak and poplar and elm  becaus the shadow thereof is good  therefor your daughter shall commit whoredom  and your spous shall commit adulteri  4  14 i will not punish your daughter when they commit whoredom  nor your spous when they commit adulteri  for themselv are separ with whore  and they sacrific with harlot  therefor the peopl that doth not understand shall fall  4  15 though thou  israel  play the harlot  yet let not judah offend  and come not ye unto gilgal  neither go ye up to bethaven  nor swear  the lord liveth  4  16 for israel slideth back as a backslid heifer  now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a larg place  4  17 ephraim is join to idol  let him alon  4  18 their drink is sour  they have commit whoredom continu  her ruler with shame do love  give ye  4  19 the wind hath bound her up in her wing  and they shall be asham becaus of their sacrific  5  1 hear ye this  o priest  and hearken  ye hous of israel  and give ye ear  o hous of the king  for judgment is toward you  becaus ye have been a snare on mizpah  and a net spread upon tabor  5  2 and the revolt are profound to make slaughter  though i have been a rebuk of them all  5  3 i know ephraim  and israel is not hid from me  for now  o ephraim  thou committest whoredom  and israel is defil  5  4 they will not frame their do to turn unto their god  for the spirit of whoredom is in the midst of them  and they have not known the lord  5  5 and the pride of israel doth testifi to his face  therefor shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniqu  judah also shall fall with them  5  6 they shall go with their flock and with their herd to seek the lord  but they shall not find him  he hath withdrawn himself from them  5  7 they have dealt treacher against the lord  for they have begotten strang children  now shall a month devour them with their portion  5  8 blow ye the cornet in gibeah  and the trumpet in ramah  cri aloud at bethaven  after thee  o benjamin  5  9 ephraim shall be desol in the day of rebuk  among the tribe of israel have i made known that which shall sure be  5  10 the princ of judah were like them that remov the bound  therefor i will pour out my wrath upon them like water  5  11 ephraim is oppress and broken in judgment  becaus he will walk after the command  5  12 therefor will i be unto ephraim as a moth  and to the hous of judah as rotten  5  13 when ephraim saw his sick  and judah saw his wound  then went ephraim to the assyrian  and sent to king jareb  yet could he not heal you  nor cure you of your wound  5  14 for i will be unto ephraim as a lion  and as a young lion to the hous of judah  i  even i  will tear and go away  i will take away  and none shall rescu him  5  15 i will go and return to my place  till they acknowledg their offenc  and seek my face  in their afflict they will seek me earli  6  1 come  and let us return unto the lord  for he hath torn  and he will heal us  he hath smitten  and he will bind us up  6  2 after two day will he reviv us  in the third day he will rais us up  and we shall live in his sight  6  3 then shall we know  if we follow on to know the lord  his go forth is prepar as the morn  and he shall come unto us as the rain  as the latter and former rain unto the earth  6  4 o ephraim  what shall i do unto thee  o judah  what shall i do unto thee  for your good is as a morn cloud  and as the earli dew it goeth away  6  5 therefor have i hew them by the prophet  i have slain them by the word of my mouth  and thi judgment are as the light that goeth forth  6  6 for i desir merci  and not sacrific  and the knowledg of god more than burnt offer  6  7 but they like men have transgress the coven  there have they dealt treacher against me  6  8 gilead is a citi of them that work iniqu  and is pollut with blood  6  9 and as troop of robber wait for a man  so the compani of priest murder in the way by consent  for they commit lewd  6  10 i have seen an horribl thing in the hous of israel  there is the whoredom of ephraim  israel is defil  6  11 also  o judah  he hath set an harvest for thee  when i return the captiv of my peopl  7  1 when i would have heal israel  then the iniqu of ephraim was discov  and the wicked of samaria  for they commit falsehood  and the thief cometh in  and the troop of robber spoileth without  7  2 and they consid not in their heart that i rememb all their wicked  now their own do have beset them about  they are befor my face  7  3 they make the king glad with their wicked  and the princ with their lie  7  4 they are all adulter  as an oven heat by the baker  who ceaseth from rais after he hath knead the dough  until it be leaven  7  5 in the day of our king the princ have made him sick with bottl of wine  he stretch out his hand with scorner  7  6 for they have made readi their heart like an oven  while they lie in wait  their baker sleepeth all the night  in the morn it burneth as a flame fire  7  7 they are all hot as an oven  and have devour their judg  all their king are fallen  there is none among them that calleth unto me  7  8 ephraim  he hath mix himself among the peopl  ephraim is a cake not turn  7  9 stranger have devour his strength  and he knoweth it not  yea  gray hair are here and there upon him  yet he knoweth not  7  10 and the pride of israel testifieth to his face  and they do not return to the lord their god  nor seek him for all this  7  11 ephraim also is like a silli dove without heart  they call to egypt  they go to assyria  7  12 when they shall go  i will spread my net upon them  i will bring them down as the fowl of the heaven  i will chastis them  as their congreg hath heard  7  13 woe unto them  for they have fled from me  destruct unto them  becaus they have transgress against me  though i have redeem them  yet they have spoken lie against me  7  14 and they have not cri unto me with their heart  when they howl upon their bed  they assembl themselv for corn and wine  and they rebel against me  7  15 though i have bound and strengthen their arm  yet do they imagin mischief against me  7  16 they return  but not to the most high  they are like a deceit bow  their princ shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongu  this shall be their deris in the land of egypt  8  1 set the trumpet to thi mouth  he shall come as an eagl against the hous of the lord  becaus they have transgress my coven  and trespass against my law  8  2 israel shall cri unto me  my god  we know thee  8  3 israel hath cast off the thing that is good  the enemi shall pursu him  8  4 they have set up king  but not by me  they have made princ  and i knew it not  of their silver and their gold have they made them idol  that they may be cut off  8  5 thi calf  o samaria  hath cast thee off  mine anger is kindl against them  how long will it be ere they attain to innoc  8  6 for from israel was it also  the workman made it  therefor it is not god  but the calf of samaria shall be broken in piec  8  7 for they have sown the wind  and they shall reap the whirlwind  it hath no stalk  the bud shall yield no meal  if so be it yield  the stranger shall swallow it up  8  8 israel is swallow up  now shall they be among the gentil as a vessel wherein is no pleasur  8  9 for they are gone up to assyria  a wild ass alon by himself  ephraim hath hire lover  8  10 yea  though they have hire among the nation  now will i gather them  and they shall sorrow a littl for the burden of the king of princ  8  11 becaus ephraim hath made mani altar to sin  altar shall be unto him to sin  8  12 i have written to him the great thing of my law  but they were count as a strang thing  8  13 they sacrific flesh for the sacrific of mine offer  and eat it  but the lord accepteth them not  now will he rememb their iniqu  and visit their sin  they shall return to egypt  8  14 for israel hath forgotten his maker  and buildeth templ  and judah hath multipli fenc citi  but i will send a fire upon his citi  and it shall devour the

where no gin is for him  shall one take up a snare from the earth  and have taken noth at all  3  6 shall a trumpet be blown in the citi  and the peopl not be afraid  shall there be evil in a citi  and the lord hath not done it  3  7 sure the lord god will do noth  but he revealeth his secret unto his servant the prophet  3  8 the lion hath roar  who will not fear  the lord god hath spoken  who

and the oppress in the midst thereof  3  10 for they know not to do right  saith the lord  who store up violenc and robberi in their palac  3  11 therefor thus saith the lord god  an adversari there shall be even round about the land  and he shall bring down thi strength from thee  and thi palac shall be spoil  3  12 thus saith the lord  as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two leg  or a piec of an ear  so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed  and in damascus in a couch  3  13 hear ye  and testifi in the hous of jacob  saith the lord god  the god of host  3  14 that in the day that i shall visit the transgress of israel upon him i will also visit the altar of bethel  and the horn of the altar shall be cut off  and fall to the ground  3  15 and i will smite the winter hous with the summer hous  and the hous of ivori shall perish  and the great hous shall have an end  saith the lord  4  1 hear this word  ye kine of bashan  that are in the mountain of samaria  which oppress the poor  which crush the needi  which say to their master  bring  and let us drink  4  2 the lord god hath sworn by his holi  that  lo  the day shall come upon you  that he will take you away with hook  and your poster with fishhook  4  3 and ye shall go out at the breach  everi cow at that which is befor her  and ye shall cast them into the palac  saith the lord  4  4 come to bethel  and transgress  at gilgal multipli transgress  and bring your sacrific everi morn  and your tith after three year  4  5 and offer a sacrific of thanksgiv with leaven  and proclaim and publish the free offer  for this liketh you  o ye children of israel  saith the lord god  4  6 and i also have given you clean of teeth in all your citi  and want of bread in all your place  yet have ye not return unto me  saith the lord  4  7 and also i have withholden the rain from you  when there were yet three month to the harvest  and i caus it to rain upon one citi  and caus it not to rain upon anoth citi  one piec was rain upon  and the piec whereupon it rain not wither  4  8 so two or three citi wander unto one citi  to drink water  but they were not satisfi  yet have ye not return unto me  saith the lord  4  9 i have smitten you with blast and mildew  when your garden and your vineyard and your fig tree and your oliv tree increas  the palmerworm devour them  yet have ye not return unto me  saith the lord  4  10 i have sent among you the pestil after the manner of egypt  your young men have i slain with the sword  and have taken away your hors  and i have made the stink of your camp to come up unto your nostril  yet have ye not return unto me  saith the lord  4  11 i have overthrown some of you  as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah  and ye were as a firebrand pluck out of the burn  yet have ye not return unto me  saith the lord  4  12 therefor thus will i do unto thee  o israel  and becaus i will do this unto thee  prepar to meet thi god  o israel  4  13 for  lo  he that formeth the mountain  and createth the wind  and declareth unto man what is his thought  that maketh the morn dark  and treadeth upon the high place of the earth  the lord  the god of host  is his name  5  1 hear ye this word which i take up against you  even a lament  o hous of israel  5  2 the virgin of israel is fallen  she shall no more rise  she is forsaken upon her land  there is none to rais her up  5  3 for thus saith the lord god  the citi that went out by a thousand shall leav an hundr  and that which went forth by an hundr shall leav ten  to the hous of israel  5  4 for thus saith the lord unto the hous of israel  seek ye me  and ye shall live  5  5 but seek not bethel  nor enter into gilgal  and pass not to beersheba  for gilgal shall sure go into captiv  and bethel shall come to nought  5  6 seek the lord  and ye shall live  lest he break out like fire in the hous of joseph  and devour it  and there be none to quench it in bethel  5  7 ye who turn judgment to wormwood  and leav off righteous in the earth  5  8 seek him that maketh the seven star and orion  and turneth the shadow of death into the morn  and maketh the day dark with night  that calleth for the water of the sea  and poureth them out upon the face of the earth  the lord is his name  5  9 that strengtheneth the spoil against the strong  so that the spoil shall come against the fortress  5  10 they hate him that rebuketh in the gate  and they abhor him that speaketh upright  5  11 forasmuch therefor as your tread is upon the poor  and ye take from him burden of wheat  ye have built hous of hewn stone  but ye shall not dwell in them  ye have plant pleasant vineyard  but ye shall not drink wine of them  5  12 for i know your manifold transgress and your mighti sin  they afflict the just  they take a bribe  and they turn asid the poor in the gate from their right  5  13 therefor the prudent shall keep silenc in that time  for it is an evil time  5  14 seek good  and not evil  that ye may live  and so the lord  the god of host  shall be with you  as ye have spoken  5  15 hate the evil  and love the good  and establish judgment in the gate  it may be that the lord god of host will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph  5  16 therefor the lord  the god of host  the lord  saith thus  wail shall be in all street  and they shall say in all the highway  ala  ala  and they shall call the husbandman to mourn  and such as are skil of lament to wail  5  17 and in all vineyard shall be wail  for i will pass through thee  saith the lord  5  18 woe unto you that desir the day of the lord  to what end is it for you  the day of the lord is dark  and not light  5  19 as if a man did flee from a lion  and a bear met him  or went into the hous  and lean his hand on the wall  and a serpent bit him  5  20 shall not the day of the lord be dark  and not light  even veri dark  and no bright in it  5  21 i hate  i despis your feast day  and i will not smell in your solemn assembl  5  22 though ye offer me burnt offer and your meat offer  i will not accept them  neither will i regard the peac offer of your fat beast  5  23 take thou away from me the nois of thi song  for i will not hear the melodi of thi viol  5  24 but let judgment run down as water  and righteous as a mighti stream  5  25 have ye offer unto me sacrific and offer in the wilder forti year  o hous of israel  5  26 but ye have born the tabernacl of your moloch and chiun your imag  the star of your god  which ye made to yourselv  5  27 therefor will i caus you to go into captiv beyond damascus  saith the lord  whose name is the god of host  6  1 woe to them that are at eas in zion  and trust in the mountain of samaria  which are name chief of the nation  to whom the hous of israel came  6  2 pass ye unto calneh  and see  and from thenc go ye to hamath the great  then go down to gath of the philistin  be they better than these kingdom  or their border greater than your border  6  3 ye that put far away the evil day  and caus the seat of violenc to come near  6  4 that lie upon bed of ivori  and stretch themselv upon their couch  and eat the lamb out of the flock  and the calv out of the midst of the stall  6  5 that chant to the sound of the viol  and invent to themselv instrument of musick  like david  6  6 that drink wine in bowl  and anoint themselv with the chief ointment  but they are not griev for the afflict of joseph  6  7 therefor now shall they go captiv with the first that go captiv  and the banquet of them that stretch themselv shall be remov  6  8 the lord god hath sworn by himself  saith the lord the god of host  i abhor the excel of jacob  and hate his palac  therefor will i deliv up the citi with all that is therein  6  9 and it shall come to pass  if there remain ten men in one hous  that they shall die  6  10 and a man  s uncl shall take him up  and he that burneth him  to bring out the bone out of the hous  and shall say unto him that is by the side of the hous  is there yet ani with thee  and he shall say  no  then shall he say  hold thi tongu  for we may not make mention of the name of the lord  6  11 for  behold  the lord commandeth  and he will smite the great hous with breach  and the littl hous with cleft  6  12 shall hors run upon the rock  will one plow there with oxen  for ye have turn judgment into gall  and the fruit of righteous into hemlock  6  13 ye which rejoic in a thing of nought  which say  have we not taken to us horn by our own strength  6  14 but  behold  i will rais up against you a nation  o hous of israel  saith the lord the god of host  and they shall afflict you from the enter in of hemath unto the river of the wilder  7  1 thus hath the lord god shew unto me  and  behold  he form grasshopp in the begin of the shoot up of the latter growth  and  lo  it was the latter growth after the king  s mow  7  2 and it came to pass  that when they had made an end of eat the grass of the land  then i said  o lord god  forgiv  i beseech thee  by whom shall jacob aris  for he is small  7  3 the lord repent for this  it shall not be  saith the lord  7  4 thus hath the lord god shew unto me  and  behold  the lord god call to contend by fire  and it devour the great deep  and did eat up a part  7  5 then said i  o lord god  ceas  i beseech thee  by whom shall jacob aris  for he is small  7  6 the lord repent for this  this also shall not be  saith the lord god  7  7 thus he shew me  and  behold  the lord stood upon a wall made by a plumblin  with a plumblin in his hand  7  8 and the lord said unto me  amo  what seest thou  and i said  a plumblin  then said the lord  behold  i will set a plumblin in the midst of my peopl israel  i will not again pass by them ani more  7  9 and the high place of isaac shall be desol  and the sanctuari of israel shall be laid wast  and i will rise against the hous of jeroboam with the sword  7  10 then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel  say  amo hath conspir against thee in the midst of the hous of israel  the land is not abl to bear all his word  7  11 for thus amo saith  jeroboam shall die by the sword  and israel shall sure be led away captiv out of their own land  7  12 also amaziah said unto amo  o thou seer  go  flee thee away into the land of judah  and there eat bread  and prophesi there  7  13 but prophesi not again ani more at bethel  for it is the king  s chapel  and it is the king  s court  7  14 then answer amo  and said to amaziah  i was no prophet  neither was i a prophet  s son  but i was an herdman  and a gather of sycomor fruit  7  15 and the lord took me as i follow the flock  and the lord said unto me  go  prophesi unto my peopl israel  7  16 now therefor hear thou the word of the lord  thou sayest  prophesi not against israel  and drop not thi word against the hous of isaac  7  17 therefor thus saith the lord  thi wife shall be an harlot in the citi  and thi son and thi daughter shall fall by the sword  and thi land shall be divid by line  and thou shalt die in a pollut land  and israel shall sure go into captiv forth of his land  8  1 thus hath the lord god shew unto me  and behold a basket of summer fruit  8  2 and he said  amo  what seest thou  and i said  a basket of summer fruit  then said the lord unto me  the end is come upon my peopl of israel  i will not again pass by them ani more  8  3 and the song of the templ shall be howl in that day  saith the lord god  there shall be mani dead bodi in everi place  they shall cast them forth with silenc  8  4 hear this  o ye that swallow up the needi  even to make the poor of the land to fail  8  5 say  when will the new moon be gone  that we may sell corn  and the sabbath  that we may set forth wheat  make the ephah small  and the shekel great  and falsifi the balanc by deceit  8  6 that we may buy the poor for silver  and the needi for a pair of shoe  yea  and sell the refus of the wheat  8  7 the lord hath sworn by the excel of jacob  sure i will never forget ani of their work  8  8 shall not the land trembl for this  and everi one mourn that dwelleth therein  and it shall rise up wholli as a flood  and it shall be cast out and drown  as by the flood of egypt  8  9 and it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord god  that i will caus the sun to go down at noon  and i will darken the earth in the clear day  8  10 and i will turn your feast into mourn  and all your song into lament  and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loin  and bald upon everi head  and i will make it as the mourn of an onli son  and the end thereof as a bitter day  8  11 behold  the day come  saith the lord god  that i will send a famin in the land  not a famin of bread  nor a thirst for water  but of hear the word of the lord  8  12 and they shall wander from sea to sea  and from the north even to the east  they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord  and shall not find it  8  13 in that day shall the fair virgin and young men faint for thirst  8  14 they that swear by the sin of samaria  and say  thi god  o dan  liveth  and  the manner of beersheba liveth  even they shall fall  and never rise up again  9  1 i saw the lord stand upon the altar  and he said  smite the lintel of the door  that the post may shake  and cut them in the head  all of them  and i will slay the last of them with the sword  he that fleeth of them shall not flee away  and he that escapeth of them shall not be deliv  9  2 though they dig into hell  thenc shall mine hand take them  though they climb up to heaven  thenc will i bring them down  9  3 and though they hide themselv in the top of carmel  i will search and take them out thenc  and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea  thenc will i command the serpent  and he shall bite them  9  4 and though they go into captiv befor their enemi  thenc will i command the sword  and it shall slay them  and i will set mine eye upon them for evil  and not for good  9  5 and the lord god of host is he that toucheth the land  and it shall melt  and all that dwell therein shall mourn  and it shall rise up wholli like a flood  and shall be drown  as by the flood of egypt  9  6 it is he that buildeth his stori in the heaven  and hath found his troop in the earth  he that calleth for the water of the sea  and poureth them out upon the face of the earth  the lord is his name  9  7 are ye not as children of the ethiopian unto me  o children of israel  saith the lord  have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt  and the philistin from caphtor  and the syrian from kir  9  8 behold  the eye of the lord god are upon the sin kingdom  and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth  save that i will not utter destroy the hous of jacob  saith the lord  9  9 for  lo  i will command  and i will sift the hous of israel among all nation  like as corn is sift in a siev  yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth  9  10 all the sinner of my peopl shall die by the sword  which say  the evil shall not overtak nor prevent us  9  11 in that day will i rais up the tabernacl of david that is fallen  and close up the breach thereof  and i will rais up his ruin  and i will build it as in the day of old  9  12 that they may possess the remnant of edom  and of all the heathen  which are call by my name  saith the lord that doeth this  9  13 behold  the day come  saith the lord  that the plowman shall overtak the reaper  and the treader of grape him that soweth seed  and the mountain shall drop sweet wine  and all the hill shall melt  9  14 and i will bring again the captiv of my peopl of israel  and they shall build the wast citi  and inhabit them  and they shall plant vineyard  and drink the wine thereof  they shall also make garden  and eat the fruit of them  9  15 and i will plant them upon their land  and they shall no more be pull up out of their land which i have given them  saith

whose habit is high  that saith in his heart  who shall bring me down to the ground  1  4 though thou exalt thyself as the eagl  and though thou set thi nest among the star  thenc will i bring thee

violenc against thi brother jacob shame shall cover thee  and thou shalt be cut off for ever  1  11 in the day that thou stoodest on the other side  in the day that the stranger carri away captiv his forc  and foreign enter into his gate  and cast lot upon jerusalem  even thou wast as one of them  1  12 but thou shouldest not have look on the day of thi brother in the day that he becam a stranger  neither shouldest thou have rejoic over the children of judah in the day of their destruct  neither shouldest thou have spoken proud in the day of distress  1  13 thou shouldest not have enter into the gate of my peopl in the day of their calam  yea  thou shouldest not have look on their afflict in the day of their calam  nor have laid hand on their substanc in the day of their calam  1  14 neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway  to cut off those of his that did escap  neither shouldest thou have deliv up those of his that did remain in the day of distress  1  15 for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen  as thou hast done  it shall be done unto thee  thi reward shall return upon thine own head  1  16 for as ye have drunk upon my holi mountain  so shall all the heathen drink continu  yea  they shall drink  and they shall swallow down  and they shall be as though they had not been  1  17 but upon mount zion shall be deliver  and there shall be holi  and the

to the prophet  say  should i weep in the fifth month  separ myself  as i have done these so mani year  7  4 then came the word of the lord of host unto me  say  7  5 speak unto all the peopl of the land  and to the priest  say  when ye fast and mourn in the fifth and seventh month  even those seventi year  did ye at all fast unto me  even to me  7  6 and when ye did eat  and when ye did drink  did not ye eat for yourselv  and drink for yourselv  7  7 should ye not hear the word which the lord hath cri by the former prophet  when jerusalem was inhabit and in prosper  and the citi thereof round about her  when men inhabit the south and the plain  7  8 and the word of the lord came unto zechariah  say  7  9 thus speaketh the lord of host  say  execut true judgment  and shew merci and

die  and that that is to be cut off  let it be cut off  and let the rest eat everi one the flesh of anoth  11  10 and i took my staff  even beauti  and cut it asund  that i might break my coven which i had made with all the peopl  11  11 and it was broken in that day  and so the poor of the flock that wait upon me knew that it was the word of the lord  11  12 and i said unto them  if ye think good  give me my price  and if not  forbear  so they weigh for my price thirti piec of silver  11  13 and the lord said unto me  cast it unto the potter  a good price that i was prise at of them  and i took the thirti piec of silver  and cast them to the potter in the hous of the lord  11  14 then i cut asund mine other staff  even band  that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel  11  15 and the lord said unto me  take unto thee yet the instrument of a foolish shepherd  11  16 for  lo  i will rais up a shepherd in the land  which shall not visit those that be cut off  neither shall seek the young one  nor heal that that is broken  nor feed that that standeth still  but he shall eat the flesh of the fat  and tear their claw in piec  11  17 woe to the idol shepherd that

round about  when they shall be in the sieg both against judah and against jerusalem  12  3 and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensom stone for all peopl  all that burden themselv with it shall be cut in piec  though all the peopl of the earth be gather togeth against it  12  4 in that day  saith the lord  i will smite everi hors with astonish  and his rider with mad  and i will open mine eye upon the hous of judah  and will smite everi hors of the peopl with blind  12  5 and the governor of judah shall say in their heart  the inhabit of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of host their god  12  6 in that day will i make the governor of judah like an hearth of fire among the wood  and like a torch of fire in a sheaf  and they shall devour all the peopl round about  on the right hand and on the left  and jerusalem shall be inhabit again in her own place  even in jerusalem  12  7 the lord also shall save the tent of judah first  that the glori of the hous of david and the glori of the inhabit of jerusalem do not magnifi themselv against judah  12  8 in that day shall the lord defend the inhabit of jerusalem  and he that is feebl among them at that day shall be as david  and the hous of david shall be as god  as the angel of the lord befor them  12  9 and it shall come to pass in that day  that i will seek to destroy all the nation that come against jerusalem  12  10 and i will pour upon the hous of david  and upon the inhabit of jerusalem  the spirit of grace and of supplic  and they shall look upon me whom they have pierc  and they shall mourn for him  as one mourneth for his onli son  and shall be in bitter for him  as one that is in bitter for his firstborn  12  11 in that day shall there be a great mourn in jerusalem  as the mourn of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon  12  12 and the land shall mourn  everi famili apart  the famili of the hous of david apart  and their wive apart  the famili of the hous of nathan apart  and their wive apart  12  13 the famili of the hous of levi apart  and their wive apart  the famili of shimei apart  and their wive apart  12  14 all the famili that remain  everi famili apart  and their wive apart  13  1 in that day there shall be a fountain open to the hous of david and to the inhabit of jerusalem for sin and for unclean  13  2 and it shall come to pass in that day  saith the lord of host  that i will cut off the name of the idol out of the land  and they shall no more be rememb  and also i will caus the prophet and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land  13  3 and it shall come to pass  that when ani shall yet prophesi  then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him  thou shalt not live  for thou speakest lie in the name of the lord  and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth  13  4 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the prophet shall be asham everi one of his vision  when he hath prophesi  neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceiv  13  5 but he shall say  i am no prophet  i am an husbandman  for man taught me to keep cattl from my youth  13  6 and one shall say unto him  what are these wound in thine hand  then he shall answer  those with which i was wound in the hous of my friend  13  7 awak  o sword  against my shepherd  and against the man that is my fellow  saith the lord of host  smite the shepherd  and the sheep shall be scatter  and i will turn mine hand upon the littl one  13  8 and it shall come to pass  that in all the land  saith the lord  two part therein shall be cut off and die  but the third shall be left therein  13  9 and i will bring the third part through the fire  and will refin them as silver is refin  and will tri them as gold is tri  they shall call on my name  and i will hear them  i will say  it is my peopl  and they shall say  the lord is my god  14  1 behold  the day of the lord cometh  and thi spoil shall be divid in the midst of thee  14  2 for i will gather all nation against jerusalem to battl  and the citi shall be taken  and the hous rifl  and the women ravish  and half of the citi shall go forth into captiv  and the residu of the peopl shall not be cut off from the citi  14  3 then shall the lord go forth  and fight against those nation  as when he fought in the day of battl  14  4 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of oliv  which is befor jerusalem on the east  and the mount of oliv shall cleav in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west  and there shall be a veri great valley  and half of the mountain shall remov toward the north  and half of it toward the south  14  5 and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountain  for the valley of the mountain shall reach unto azal  yea  ye shall flee  like as ye fled from befor the earthquak in the day of uzziah king of judah  and the lord my god shall come  and all the saint with thee  14  6 and it shall come to pass in that day  that the light shall not be clear  nor dark  14  7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord  not day  nor night  but it shall come to pass  that at even time it shall be light  14  8 and it shall be in that day  that live water shall go out from jerusalem  half of them toward the former sea  and half of them toward the hinder sea  in summer and in winter shall it be  14  9 and the lord shall be king over all the earth  in that day shall there be one lord  and his name one  14  10 all the land shall be turn as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem  and it shall be lift up  and inhabit in her place  from benjamin  s gate unto the place of the first gate  unto the corner gate  and from the tower of hananeel unto the king  s winepress  14  11 and men shall dwell in it  and there shall be no more utter destruct  but jerusalem shall be safe inhabit  14  12 and this shall be the plagu wherewith the lord will smite all the peopl that have fought against jerusalem  their flesh shall consum away while they stand upon their feet  and their eye shall consum away in their hole  and their tongu shall consum away in their mouth  14  13 and it shall come to pass in that day  that a great tumult from the lord shall be among them  and they shall lay hold everi one on the hand of his neighbour  and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour  14  14 and judah also shall fight at jerusalem  and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gather togeth  gold  and silver  and apparel  in great abund  14  15 and so shall be the plagu of the hors  of the mule  of the camel  and of the ass  and of all the beast that shall be in these tent  as this plagu  14  16 and it shall come to pass  that everi one that is left of all the nation which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king  the lord of host  and to keep the feast of tabernacl  14  17 and it shall be  that whoso will not come

corrupt the coven of levi  saith the lord of host  2  9 therefor have i also made you contempt and base befor all the peopl  accord as ye have not kept my way  but have been partial in the law  2  10 have we not all one father  hath not one god creat us  whi do we deal treacher everi man against his brother  by profan the coven of our father  2  11 judah hath dealt treacher  and an abomin is

prophet which were befor you  5  13 ye are the salt of the earth  but if the salt have lost his savour  wherewith shall it be salt  it is thenceforth good for noth  but to be cast out  and to be trodden under foot of men  5  14 ye are the light of the world  a citi that is set on an hill cannot be hid  5  15 neither do men light a candl  and put it under a bushel  but on a candlestick  and it giveth light unto all that are in the hous  5  16 let your light so shine befor men  that they may see your good work  and glorifi your father which is in heaven  5  17 think not that i am come to

shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven  5  20 for i say unto you  that except your righteous shall exceed the righteous of the scribe and pharise  ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven  5  21 ye have heard that it was said of them of old time  thou shalt not kill  and whosoev shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment  5  22 but i say unto you  that whosoev is angri with his brother without a caus shall be in danger of the judgment  and whosoev shall say to his brother  raca  shall be in danger of the council  but whosoev shall say  thou fool  shall be in danger of hell fire  5  23 therefor if thou bring thi gift to the altar  and there rememberest that thi brother hath ought against thee  5  24 leav there thi gift befor the altar  and go thi way  first be

said by them of old time  thou shalt not commit adulteri  5  28 but i say unto you  that whosoev looketh on a woman to lust after her hath commit adulteri with her alreadi in his heart  5  29 and if thi right eye offend thee  pluck it out  and cast it from thee  for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should perish  and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell  5  30 and if thi right hand offend thee  cut it off  and cast it from thee  for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should perish  and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell  5  31 it hath been said  whosoev shall put away his wife  let him give her a write of divorc  5  32 but i say unto you  that whosoev shall put away his wife  save for the caus of fornic  causeth her to commit adulteri  and whosoev shall marri her that is divorc committeth adulteri  5  33 again  ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time  thou shalt not forswear thyself  but shalt perform unto the lord thine oath  5  34 but i say unto you  swear not at all  neither by heaven  for it is god  s throne  5  35 nor by the earth  for it is his footstool  neither by jerusalem  for it is the citi of the great king  5  36 neither shalt thou swear by thi head  becaus thou canst not make one hair white or black  5  37 but let your communic be  yea  yea  nay  nay  for whatsoev is more than these cometh of evil  5  38 ye have heard that it hath been said  an eye for an eye  and a tooth for a tooth  5  39 but i say unto you  that ye resist not evil  but whosoev shall smite thee on thi right cheek  turn to him the other also  5  40 and if ani man will sue thee at the law  and take away thi coat  let him have thi cloak also  5  41 and whosoev shall compel thee to go a mile  go with him twain  5  42 give to him that asketh thee  and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away  5  43 ye have heard that it hath been said  thou shalt love thi neighbour  and hate thine enemi  5  44 but i say unto you  love your enemi  bless them that curs you  do good to them that hate you  and pray for them which despit use you  and persecut you  5  45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven  for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good  and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust  5  46 for if ye love them which love you  what reward have ye  do not even the publican the same  5  47 and if ye salut your brethren onli  what do ye more than other  do not even the publican so  5  48 be ye therefor perfect  even as your father which is in heaven is perfect  6  1 take heed that ye do not your alm befor men  to be seen of them  otherwis ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven  6  2 therefor when thou doest thine alm  do not sound a trumpet befor thee  as the hypocrit do in the synagogu and in the street  that they may have glori of men  verili i say unto you  they have their reward  6  3 but when thou doest alm  let not thi left hand know what thi right hand doeth  6  4 that thine alm may be in secret  and thi father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee open  6  5 and when thou prayest  thou shalt not be as the hypocrit are  for they love to pray stand in the synagogu and in the corner of the street  that they may be seen of men  verili i say unto you  they have their reward  6  6 but thou  when thou prayest  enter into thi closet  and when thou hast shut thi door  pray to thi father which is in secret  and thi father which seeth in secret shall reward thee open  6  7 but when ye pray  use not vain repetit  as the heathen do  for they think that they shall be heard for their much speak  6  8 be not ye therefor like unto them  for your father knoweth what thing ye have need of  befor ye ask him  6  9 after this manner therefor pray ye  our father which art in heaven  hallow be thi name  6  10 thi kingdom come  thi will be done in earth  as it is in heaven  6  11 give us this day our daili bread  6  12 and forgiv us our debt  as we forgiv our debtor  6  13 and lead us not into temptat  but deliv us from evil  for thine is the kingdom  and the power  and the glori  for ever  amen  6  14 for if ye forgiv men their trespass  your heaven father will also forgiv you  6  15 but if ye forgiv not men their trespass  neither will your father forgiv your trespass  6  16 moreov when ye fast  be not  as the hypocrit  of a sad counten  for they disfigur their face  that they may appear unto men to fast  verili i say unto you  they have their reward  6  17 but thou  when thou fastest  anoint thine head  and wash thi face  6  18 that thou appear not unto men to fast  but unto thi father which is in secret  and thi father  which seeth in secret  shall reward thee open  6  19 lay not up for yourselv treasur upon earth  where moth and rust doth corrupt  and where thiev break through and steal  6  20 but lay up for yourselv treasur in heaven  where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt  and where thiev do not break through nor steal  6  21 for where your treasur is  there will your heart be also  6  22 the light of the bodi is the eye  if therefor thine eye be singl  thi whole bodi shall be full of light  6  23 but if thine eye be evil  thi whole bodi shall be full of dark  if therefor the light that is in thee be dark  how great is that dark  6  24 no man can serv two master  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or els he will hold to the one  and despis the other  ye cannot serv god and mammon  6  25 therefor i say unto you  take no thought for your life  what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink  nor yet for your bodi  what ye shall put on  is not the life more than meat  and the bodi than raiment  6  26 behold the fowl of the air  for they sow not  neither do they reap  nor gather into barn  yet your heaven father feedeth them  are ye not much better than they  6  27 which of you by take thought can add one cubit unto his statur  6  28 and whi take ye thought for raiment  consid the lili of the field  how they grow  they toil not  neither do they spin  6  29 and yet i say unto you  that even solomon in all his glori was not array like one of these  6  30 wherefor  if god so cloth the grass of the field  which to day is  and to morrow is cast into the oven  shall he not much more cloth you  o ye of littl faith  6  31 therefor take no thought  say  what shall we eat  or  what shall we drink  or  wherewith shall we be cloth  6  32  for after all these thing do the gentil seek  for your heaven father knoweth that ye have need of all these thing  6  33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god  and his righteous  and all these thing shall be ad unto you  6  34 take therefor no thought for the morrow  for the morrow shall take thought for the thing of itself  suffici unto the day is the evil thereof  7  1 judg not  that ye be not judg  7  2 for with what judgment ye judg  ye shall be judg  and with what measur ye mete  it shall be measur to you again  7  3 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother  s eye  but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye  7  4 or how wilt thou say to thi brother  let me pull out the mote out of thine eye  and  behold  a beam is in thine own eye  7  5 thou hypocrit  first cast out the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clear to cast out the mote out of thi brother  s eye  7  6 give not that which is holi unto the dog  neither cast ye your pearl befor swine  lest they trampl them under their feet  and turn again and rend you  7  7 ask  and it shall be given you  seek  and ye shall find  knock  and it shall be open unto you  7  8 for everi one that asketh receiveth  and he that seeketh findeth  and to him that knocketh it shall be open  7  9 or what man is there of you  whom if his son ask bread  will he give him a stone  7  10 or if he ask a fish  will he give him a serpent  7  11 if ye then  be evil  know how to give good gift unto your children  how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good thing to them that ask him  7  12 therefor all thing whatsoev ye would that men should do to you  do ye even so to them  for this is the law and the prophet  7  13 enter ye in at the strait gate  for wide is the gate  and broad is the way  that leadeth to destruct  and mani there be which go in thereat  7  14 becaus strait is the gate  and narrow is the way  which leadeth unto life  and few there be that find it  7  15 bewar of fals prophet  which come to you in sheep  s cloth  but inward they are raven wolv  7  16 ye shall know them by their fruit  do men gather grape of thorn  or fig of thistl  7  17 even so everi good tree bringeth forth good fruit  but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit  7  18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit  neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit  7  19 everi tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down  and cast into the fire  7  20 wherefor by their fruit ye shall know them  7  21 not everi one that saith unto me  lord  lord  shall enter into the kingdom of heaven  but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven  7  22 mani will say to me in that day  lord  lord  have we not prophesi in thi name  and in thi name have cast out devil  and in thi name done mani wonder work  7  23 and then will i profess unto them  i never knew you  depart from me  ye that work iniqu  7  24 therefor whosoev heareth these say of mine  and doeth them  i will liken him unto a wise man  which built his hous upon a rock  7  25 and the rain descend  and the flood came  and the wind blew  and beat upon that hous  and it fell not  for it was found upon a rock  7  26 and everi one that heareth these say of mine  and doeth them not  shall be liken unto a foolish man  which built his hous upon the sand  7  27 and the rain descend  and the flood came  and the wind blew  and beat upon that hous  and it fell  and great was the fall of it  7  28 and it came to pass  when jesus had end these say  the peopl were astonish at his doctrin  7  29 for he taught them as one have author  and not as the scribe  8  1 when he was come down from the mountain  great multitud follow him  8  2 and  behold  there came a leper and worship him  say  lord  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  8  3 and jesus put forth his hand  and touch him  say  i will  be thou clean  and immedi his leprosi was cleans  8  4 and jesus saith unto him  see thou tell no man  but go thi way  shew thyself to the priest  and offer the gift that mose command  for a testimoni unto them  8  5 and when jesus was enter into capernaum  there came unto him a centurion  beseech him  8  6 and say  lord  my servant lieth at home sick of the palsi  grievous torment  8  7 and jesus saith unto him  i will come and heal him  8  8 the centurion answer and said  lord  i am not worthi that thou shouldest come under my roof  but speak the word onli  and my servant shall be heal  8  9 for i am a man under author  have soldier under me  and i say to this man  go  and he goeth  and to anoth  come  and he cometh  and to my servant  do this  and he doeth it  8  10 when jesus heard it  he marvel  and said to them that follow  verili i say unto you  i have not found so great faith  no  not in israel  8  11 and i say unto you  that mani shall come from the east and west  and shall sit down with abraham  and isaac  and jacob  in the kingdom of heaven  8  12 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer dark  there shall be weep and gnash of teeth  8  13 and jesus said unto the centurion  go thi way  and as thou hast believ  so be it done unto thee  and his servant was heal in the selfsam hour  8  14 and when jesus was come into peter  s hous  he saw his wife  s mother laid  and sick of a fever  8  15 and he touch her hand  and the fever left her  and she aros  and minist unto them  8  16 when the even was come  they brought unto him mani that were possess with devil  and he cast out the spirit with his word  and heal all that were sick  8  17 that it might be fulfil which was spoken by esaia the prophet  say  himself took our infirm  and bare our sick  8  18 now when jesus saw great multitud about him  he gave command to depart unto the other side  8  19 and a certain scribe came  and said unto him  master  i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest  8  20 and jesus saith unto him  the fox have hole  and the bird of the air have nest  but the son of man hath not where to lay his head  8  21 and anoth of his discipl said unto him  lord  suffer me first to go and buri my father  8  22 but jesus said unto him  follow me  and let the dead buri their dead  8  23 and when he was enter into a ship  his discipl follow him  8  24 and  behold  there aros a great tempest in the sea  insomuch that the ship was cover with the wave  but he was asleep  8  25 and his discipl came to him  and awok him  say  lord  save us  we perish  8  26 and he saith unto them  whi are ye fear  o ye of littl faith  then he aros  and rebuk the wind and the sea  and there was a great calm  8  27 but the men marvel  say  what manner of man is this  that even the wind and the sea obey him  8  28 and when he was come to the other side into the countri of the gergesen  there met him two possess with devil  come out of the tomb  exceed fierc  so that no man might pass by that way  8  29 and  behold  they cri out  say  what have we to do with thee  jesus  thou son of god  art thou come hither to torment us befor the time  8  30 and there was a good way off from them an herd of mani swine feed  8  31 so the devil besought him  say  if thou cast us out  suffer us to go away into the herd of swine  8  32 and he said unto them  go  and when they were come out  they went into the herd of swine  and  behold  the whole herd of swine ran violent down a steep place into the sea  and perish in the water  8  33 and they that kept them fled  and went their way into the citi  and told everi thing  and what was befallen to the possess of the devil  8  34 and  behold  the whole citi came out to meet jesus  and when they saw him  they besought him that he would depart out of their coast  9  1 and he enter into a ship  and pass over  and came into his own citi  9  2 and  behold  they brought to him a man sick of the palsi  lie on a bed  and jesus see their faith said unto the sick of the palsi  son  be of good cheer  thi sin be forgiven thee  9  3 and  behold  certain of the scribe said within themselv  this man blasphemeth  9  4 and jesus know their thought said  wherefor think ye evil in your heart  9  5 for whether is easier  to say  thi sin be forgiven thee  or to say  aris  and walk  9  6 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin   then saith he to the sick of the palsi  aris  take up thi bed  and go unto thine hous  9  7 and he aros  and depart to his hous  9  8 but when the multitud saw it  they marvel  and glorifi god  which had given such power unto men  9  9 and as jesus pass forth from thenc  he saw a man  name matthew  sit at the receipt of custom  and he saith unto him  follow me  and he aros  and follow him  9  10 and it came to pass  as jesus sat at meat in the hous  behold  mani publican and sinner came and sat down with him and his discipl  9  11 and when the pharise saw it  they said unto his discipl  whi eateth your master with publican and sinner  9  12 but when jesus heard that  he said unto them  they that be whole need not a physician  but they that are sick  9  13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth  i will have merci  and not sacrific  for i am not come to call the righteous  but sinner to repent  9  14 then came to him the discipl of john  say  whi do we and the pharise fast oft  but thi discipl fast not  9  15 and jesus said unto them  can the children of the bridechamb mourn  as long as the bridegroom is with them  but the day will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken from them  and then shall they fast  9  16 no man putteth a piec of new cloth unto an old garment  for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment  and the rent is made wors  9  17 neither do men put new wine into old bottl  els the bottl break  and the wine runneth out  and the bottl perish  but they put new wine into new bottl  and both are preserv  9  18 while he spake these thing unto them  behold  there came a certain ruler  and worship him  say  my daughter is even now dead  but come and lay thi hand upon her  and she shall live  9  19 and jesus aros  and follow him  and so did his discipl  9  20 and  behold  a woman  which was diseas with an issu of blood twelv year  came behind him  and touch the hem of his garment  9  21 for she said within herself  if i may but touch his garment  i shall be whole  9  22 but jesus turn him about  and when he saw her  he said  daughter  be of good comfort  thi faith hath made thee whole  and the woman was made whole from that hour  9  23 and when jesus came into the ruler  s hous  and saw the minstrel and the peopl make a nois  9  24 he said unto them  give place  for the maid is not dead  but sleepeth  and they laugh him to scorn  9  25 but when the peopl were put forth  he went in  and took her by the hand  and the maid aros  9  26 and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land  9  27 and when jesus depart thenc  two blind men follow him  cri  and say  thou son of david  have merci on us  9  28 and when he was come into the hous  the blind men came to him  and jesus saith unto them  believ ye that i am abl to do this  they said unto him  yea  lord  9  29 then touch he their eye  say  accord to your faith be it unto you  9  30 and their eye were open  and jesus strait charg them  say  see that no man know it  9  31 but they  when they were depart  spread abroad his fame in all that countri  9  32 as they went out  behold  they brought to him a dumb man possess with a devil  9  33 and when the devil was cast out  the dumb spake  and the multitud marvel  say  it was never so seen in israel  9  34 but the pharise said  he casteth out devil through the princ of the devil  9  35 and jesus went about all the citi and villag  teach in their synagogu  and preach the gospel of the kingdom  and heal everi sick and everi diseas among the peopl  9  36 but when he saw the multitud  he was move with compass on them  becaus they faint  and were scatter abroad  as sheep have no shepherd  9  37 then saith he unto his discipl  the harvest truli is plenteous  but the labour are few  9  38 pray ye therefor the lord of the harvest  that he will send forth labour into his harvest  10  1 and when he had call unto him his twelv discipl  he gave them power against unclean spirit  to cast them out  and to heal all manner of sick and all manner of diseas  10  2 now the name of the twelv apostl are these  the first  simon  who is call peter  and andrew his brother  jame the son of zebede  and john his brother  10  3 philip  and bartholomew  thoma  and matthew the publican  jame the son of alphaeus  and lebbaeus  whose surnam was thaddaeus  10  4 simon the canaanit  and juda iscariot  who also betray him  10  5 these twelv jesus sent forth  and command them  say  go not into the way of the gentil  and into ani citi of the samaritan enter ye not  10  6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the hous of israel  10  7 and as ye go  preach  say  the kingdom of heaven is at hand  10  8 heal the sick  cleans the leper  rais the dead  cast out devil  freeli ye have receiv  freeli give  10  9 provid neither gold  nor silver  nor brass in your purs  10  10 nor scrip for your journey  neither two coat  neither shoe  nor yet stave  for the workman is worthi of his meat  10  11 and into whatsoev citi or town ye shall enter  enquir who in it is worthi  and there abid till ye go thenc  10  12 and when ye come into an hous  salut it  10  13 and if the hous be worthi  let your peac come upon it  but if it be not worthi  let your peac return to you  10  14 and whosoev shall not receiv you  nor hear your word  when ye depart out of that hous or citi  shake off the dust of your feet  10  15 verili i say unto you  it shall be more toler for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment  than for that citi  10  16 behold  i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolv  be ye therefor wise as serpent  and harmless as dove  10  17 but bewar of men  for they will deliv you up to the council  and they will scourg you in their synagogu  10  18 and ye shall be brought befor governor and king for my sake  for a testimoni against them and the gentil  10  19 but when they deliv you up  take no thought how or what ye shall speak  for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak  10  20 for it is not ye that speak  but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you  10  21 and the brother shall deliv up the brother to death  and the father the child  and the children shall rise up against their parent  and caus them to be put to death  10  22 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name  s sake  but he that endureth to the end shall be save  10  23 but when they persecut you in this citi  flee ye into anoth  for verili i say unto you  ye shall not have gone over the citi of israel  till the son of man be come  10  24 the discipl is not abov his master  nor the servant abov his lord  10  25 it is enough for the discipl that he be as his master  and the servant as his lord  if they have call the master of the hous beelzebub  how much more shall they call them of his household  10  26 fear them not therefor  for there is noth cover  that shall not be reveal  and hid  that shall not be known  10  27 what i tell you in dark  that speak ye in light  and what ye hear in the ear  that preach ye upon the housetop  10  28 and fear not them which kill the bodi  but are not abl to kill the soul  but rather fear him which is abl to destroy both soul and bodi in hell  10  29 are not two sparrow sold for a farth  and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father  10  30 but the veri hair of your head are all number  10  31 fear ye not therefor  ye are of more valu than mani sparrow  10  32 whosoev therefor shall confess me befor men  him will i confess also befor my father which is in heaven  10  33 but whosoev shall deni me befor men  him will i also deni befor my father which is in heaven  10  34 think not that i am come to send peac on earth  i came not to send peac  but a sword  10  35 for i am come to set a man at varianc against his father  and the daughter against her mother  and the daughter in law against her mother in law  10  36 and a man  s foe shall be they of his own household  10  37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthi of me  and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthi of me  10  38 and he that taketh not his cross  and followeth after me  is not worthi of me  10  39 he that findeth his life shall lose it  and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it  10  40 he that receiveth you receiveth me  and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me  10  41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receiv a prophet  s reward  and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receiv a righteous man  s reward  10  42 and whosoev shall give to drink unto one of these littl one a cup of cold water onli in the name of a discipl  verili i say unto you  he shall in no wise lose his reward  11  1 and it came to pass  when jesus had made an end of command his twelv discipl  he depart thenc to teach and to preach in their citi  11  2 now when john had heard in the prison the work of christ  he sent two of his discipl  11  3 and said unto him  art thou he that should come  or do we look for anoth  11  4 jesus answer and said unto them  go and shew john again those thing which ye do hear and see  11  5 the blind receiv their sight  and the lame walk  the leper are cleans  and the deaf hear  the dead are rais up  and the poor have the gospel preach to them  11  6 and bless is he  whosoev shall not be offend in me  11  7 and as they depart  jesus began to say unto the multitud concern john  what went ye out into the wilder to see  a reed shaken with the wind  11  8 but what went ye out for to see  a man cloth in soft raiment  behold  they that wear soft cloth are in king  hous  11  9 but what went ye out for to see  a prophet  yea  i say unto you  and more than a prophet  11  10 for this is he  of whom it is written  behold  i send my messeng befor thi face  which shall prepar thi way befor thee  11  11 verili i say unto you  among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist  notwithstand he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he  11  12 and from the day of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violenc  and the violent take it by forc  11  13 for all the prophet and the law prophesi until john  11  14 and if ye will receiv it  this is elia  which was for to come  11  15 he that hath ear to hear  let him hear  11  16 but whereunto shall i liken this generat  it is like unto children sit in the market  and call unto their fellow  11  17 and say  we have pipe unto you  and ye have not danc  we have mourn unto you  and ye have not lament  11  18 for john came neither eat nor drink  and they say  he hath a devil  11  19 the son of man came eat and drink  and they say  behold a man glutton  and a winebibb  a friend of publican and sinner  but wisdom is justifi of her children  11  20 then began he to upbraid the citi wherein most of his mighti work were done  becaus they repent not  11  21 woe unto thee  chorazin  woe unto thee  bethsaida  for if the mighti work  which were done in you  had been done in tyre and sidon  they would have repent long ago in sackcloth and ash  11  22 but i say unto you  it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment  than for you  11  23 and thou  capernaum  which art exalt unto heaven  shalt be brought down to hell  for if the mighti work  which have been done in thee  had been done in sodom  it would have remain until this day  11  24 but i say unto you  that it shall be more toler for the land of sodom in the day of judgment  than for thee  11  25 at that time jesus answer and said  i thank thee  o father  lord of heaven and earth  becaus thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent  and hast reveal them unto babe  11  26 even so  father  for so it seem good in thi sight  11  27 all thing are deliv unto me of my father  and no man knoweth the son  but the father  neither knoweth ani man the father  save the son  and he to whomsoev the son will reveal him  11  28 come unto me  all ye that labour and are heavi laden  and i will give you rest  11  29 take my yoke upon you  and learn of me  for i am meek and lowli in heart  and ye shall find rest unto your soul  11  30 for my yoke is easi  and my burden is light  12  1 at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn  and his discipl were an hungr  and began to pluck the ear of corn and to eat  12  2 but when the pharise saw it  they said unto him  behold  thi discipl do that which is not law to do upon the sabbath day  12  3 but he said unto them  have ye not read what david did  when he was an hungr  and they that were with him  12  4 how he enter into the hous of god  and did eat the shewbread  which was not law for him to eat  neither for them which were with him  but onli for the priest  12  5 or have ye not read in the law  how that on the sabbath day the priest in the templ profan the sabbath  and are blameless  12  6 but i say unto you  that in this place is one greater than the templ  12  7 but if ye had known what this meaneth  i will have merci  and not sacrific  ye would not have condemn the guiltless  12  8 for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day  12  9 and when he was depart thenc  he went into their synagogu  12  10 and  behold  there was a man which had his hand wither  and they ask him  say  is it law to heal on the sabbath day  that they might accus him  12  11 and he said unto them  what man shall there be among you  that shall have one sheep  and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day  will he not lay hold on it  and lift it out  12  12 how much then is a man better than a sheep  wherefor it is law to do well on the sabbath day  12  13 then saith he to the man  stretch forth thine hand  and he stretch it forth  and it was restor whole  like as the other  12  14 then the pharise went out  and held a council against him  how they might destroy him  12  15 but when jesus knew it  he withdrew himself from thenc  and great multitud follow him  and he heal them all  12  16 and charg them that they should not make him known  12  17 that it might be fulfil which was spoken by esaia the prophet  say  12  18 behold my servant  whom i have chosen  my belov  in whom my soul is well pleas  i will put my spirit upon him  and he shall shew judgment to the gentil  12  19 he shall not strive  nor cri  neither shall ani man hear his voic in the street  12  20 a bruis reed shall he not break  and smoke flax shall he not quench  till he send forth judgment unto victori  12  21 and in his name shall the gentil trust  12  22 then was brought unto him one possess with a devil  blind  and dumb  and he heal him  insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw  12  23 and all the peopl were amaz  and said  is not this the son of david  12  24 but when the pharise heard it  they said  this fellow doth not cast out devil  but by beelzebub the princ of the devil  12  25 and jesus knew their thought  and said unto them  everi kingdom divid against itself is brought to desol  and everi citi or hous divid against itself shall not stand  12  26 and if satan cast out satan  he is divid against himself  how shall then his kingdom stand  12  27 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil  by whom do your children cast them out  therefor they shall be your judg  12  28 but if i cast out devil by the spirit of god  then the kingdom of god is come unto you  12  29 or els how can one enter into a strong man  s hous  and spoil his good  except he first bind the strong man  and then he will spoil his hous  12  30 he that is not with me is against me  and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad  12  31 wherefor i say unto you  all manner of sin and blasphemi shall be forgiven unto men  but the blasphemi against the holi ghost shall not be forgiven unto men  12  32 and whosoev speaketh a word against the son of man  it shall be forgiven him  but whosoev speaketh against the holi ghost  it shall not be forgiven him  neither in this world  neither in the world to come  12  33 either make the tree good  and his fruit good  or els make the tree corrupt  and his fruit corrupt  for the tree is known by his fruit  12  34 o generat of viper  how can ye  be evil  speak good thing  for out of the abund of the heart the mouth speaketh  12  35 a good man out of the good treasur of the heart bringeth forth good thing  and an evil man out of the evil treasur bringeth forth evil thing  12  36 but i say unto you  that everi idl word that men shall speak  they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment  12  37 for by thi word thou shalt be justifi  and by thi word thou shalt be condemn  12  38 then certain of the scribe and of the pharise answer  say  master  we would see a sign from thee  12  39 but he answer and said unto them  an evil and adulter generat seeketh after a sign  and there shall no sign be given to it  but the sign of the prophet jona  12  40 for as jona was three day and three night in the whale  s belli  so shall the son of man be three day and three night in the heart of the earth  12  41 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generat  and shall condemn it  becaus they repent at the preach of jona  and  behold  a greater than jona is here  12  42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generat  and shall condemn it  for she came from the uttermost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon  and  behold  a greater than solomon is here  12  43 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man  he walketh through dri place  seek rest  and findeth none  12  44 then he saith  i will return into my hous from whenc i came out  and when he is come  he findeth it empti  swept  and garnish  12  45 then goeth he  and taketh with himself seven other spirit more wick than himself  and they enter in and dwell there  and the last state of that man is wors than the first  even so shall it be also unto this wick generat  12  46 while he yet talk to the peopl  behold  his mother and his brethren stood without  desir to speak with him  12  47 then one said unto him  behold  thi mother and thi brethren stand without  desir to speak with thee  12  48 but he answer and said unto him that told him  who is my mother  and who are my brethren  12  49 and he stretch forth his hand toward his discipl  and said  behold my mother and my brethren  12  50 for whosoev shall do the will of my father which is in heaven  the same is my brother  and sister  and mother  13  1 the same day went jesus out of the hous  and sat by the sea side  13  2 and great multitud were gather togeth unto him  so that he went into a ship  and sat  and the whole multitud stood on the shore  13  3 and he spake mani thing unto them in parabl  say  behold  a sower went forth to sow  13  4 and when he sow  some seed fell by the way side  and the fowl came and devour them up  13  5 some fell upon stoni place  where they had not much earth  and forthwith they sprung up  becaus they had no deep of earth  13  6 and when the sun was up  they were scorch  and becaus they had no root  they wither away  13  7 and some fell among thorn  and the thorn sprung up  and choke them  13  8 but other fell into good ground  and brought forth fruit  some an hundredfold  some sixtyfold  some thirtyfold  13  9 who hath ear to hear  let him hear  13  10 and the discipl came  and said unto him  whi speakest thou unto them in parabl  13  11 he answer and said unto them  becaus it is given unto you to know the mysteri of the kingdom of heaven  but to them it is not given  13  12 for whosoev hath  to him shall be given  and he shall have more abund  but whosoev hath not  from him shall be taken away even that he hath  13  13 therefor speak i to them in parabl  becaus they see see not  and hear they hear not  neither do they understand  13  14 and in them is fulfil the propheci of esaia  which saith  by hear ye shall hear  and shall not understand  and see ye shall see  and shall not perceiv  13  15 for this peopl  s heart is wax gross  and their ear are dull of hear  and their eye they have close  lest at ani time they should see with their eye and hear with their ear  and should understand with their heart  and should be convert  and i should heal them  13  16 but bless are your eye  for they see  and your ear  for they hear  13  17 for verili i say unto you  that mani prophet and righteous men have desir to see those thing which ye see  and have not seen them  and to hear those thing which ye hear  and have not heard them  13  18 hear ye therefor the parabl of the sower  13  19 when ani one heareth the word of the kingdom  and understandeth it not  then cometh the wick one  and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart  this is he which receiv seed by the way side  13  20 but he that receiv the seed into stoni place  the same is he that heareth the word  and anon with joy receiveth it  13  21 yet hath he not root in himself  but dureth for a while  for when tribul or persecut ariseth becaus of the word  by and by he is offend  13  22 he also that receiv seed among the thorn is he that heareth the word  and the care of this world  and the deceit of rich  choke the word  and he becometh unfruit  13  23 but he that receiv seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word  and understandeth it  which also beareth fruit  and bringeth forth  some an hundredfold  some sixti  some thirti  13  24 anoth parabl put he forth unto them  say  the kingdom of heaven is liken unto a man which sow good seed in his field  13  25 but while men slept  his enemi came and sow tare among the wheat  and went his way  13  26 but when the blade was sprung up  and brought forth fruit  then appear the tare also  13  27 so the servant of the household came and said unto him  sir  didst not thou sow good seed in thi field  from whenc then hath it tare  13  28 he said unto them  an enemi hath done this  the servant said unto him  wilt thou then that we go and gather them up  13  29 but he said  nay  lest while ye gather up the tare  ye root up also the wheat with them  13  30 let both grow togeth until the harvest  and in the time of harvest i will say to the reaper  gather ye togeth first the tare  and bind them in bundl to burn them  but gather the wheat into my barn  13  31 anoth parabl put he forth unto them  say  the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed  which a man took  and sow in his field  13  32 which inde is the least of all seed  but when it is grown  it is the greatest among herb  and becometh a tree  so that the bird of the air come and lodg in the branch thereof  13  33 anoth parabl spake he unto them  the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven  which a woman took  and hid in three measur of meal  till the whole was leaven  13  34 all these thing spake jesus unto the multitud in parabl  and without a parabl spake he not unto them  13  35 that it might be fulfil which was spoken by the prophet  say  i will open my mouth in parabl  i will utter thing which have been kept secret from the foundat of the world  13  36 then jesus sent the multitud away  and went into the hous  and his discipl came unto him  say  declar unto us the parabl of the tare of the field  13  37 he answer and said unto them  he that soweth the good seed is the son of man  13  38 the field is the world  the good seed are the children of the kingdom  but the tare are the children of the wick one  13  39 the enemi that sow them is the devil  the harvest is the end of the world  and the reaper are the angel  13  40 as therefor the tare are gather and burn in the fire  so shall it be in the end of this world  13  41 the son of man shall send forth his angel  and they shall gather out of his kingdom all thing that offend  and them which do iniqu  13  42 and shall cast them into a furnac of fire  there shall be wail and gnash of teeth  13  43 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father  who hath ear to hear  let him hear  13  44 again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasur hid in a field  the which when a man hath found  he hideth  and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath  and buyeth that field  13  45 again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man  seek good pearl  13  46 who  when he had found one pearl of great price  went and sold all that he had  and bought it  13  47 again  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net  that was cast into the sea  and gather of everi kind  13  48 which  when it was full  they drew to shore  and sat down  and gather the good into vessel  but cast the bad away  13  49 so shall it be at the end of the world  the angel shall come forth  and sever the wick from among the just  13  50 and shall cast them into the furnac of fire  there shall be wail and gnash of teeth  13  51 jesus saith unto them  have ye understood all these thing  they say unto him  yea  lord  13  52 then said he unto them  therefor everi scribe which is instruct unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an household  which bringeth forth out of his treasur thing new and old  13  53 and it came to pass  that when jesus had finish these parabl  he depart thenc  13  54 and when he was come into his own countri  he taught them in their synagogu  insomuch that they were astonish  and said  whenc hath this man this wisdom  and these mighti work  13  55 is not this the carpent  s son  is not his mother call mari  and his brethren  jame  and jose  and simon  and juda  13  56 and his sister  are they not all with us  whenc then hath this man all these thing  13  57 and they were offend in him  but jesus said unto them  a prophet is not without honour  save in his own countri  and in his own hous  13  58 and he did not mani mighti work there becaus of their unbelief  14  1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus  14  2 and said unto his servant  this is john the baptist  he is risen from the dead  and therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him  14  3 for herod had laid hold on john  and bound him  and put him in prison for herodia  sake  his brother philip  s wife  14  4 for john said unto him  it is not law for thee to have her  14  5 and when he would have put him to death  he fear the multitud  becaus they count him as a prophet  14  6 but when herod  s birthday was kept  the daughter of herodia danc befor them  and pleas herod  14  7 whereupon he promis with an oath to give her whatsoev she would ask  14  8 and she  be befor instruct of her mother  said  give me here john baptist  s head in a charger  14  9 and the king was sorri  nevertheless for the oath  s sake  and them which sat with him at meat  he command it to be given her  14  10 and he sent  and behead john in the prison  14  11 and his head was brought in a charger  and given to the damsel  and she brought it to her mother  14  12 and his discipl came  and took up the bodi  and buri it  and went and told jesus  14  13 when jesus heard of it  he depart thenc by ship into a desert place apart  and when the peopl had heard thereof  they follow him on foot out of the citi  14  14 and jesus went forth  and saw a great multitud  and was move with compass toward them  and he heal their sick  14  15 and when it was even  his discipl came to him  say  this is a desert place  and the time is now past  send the multitud away  that they may go into the villag  and buy themselv victual  14  16 but jesus said unto them  they need not depart  give ye them to eat  14  17 and they say unto him  we have here but five loav  and two fish  14  18 he said  bring them hither to me  14  19 and he command the multitud to sit down on the grass  and took the five loav  and the two fish  and look up to heaven  he bless  and brake  and gave the loav to his discipl  and the discipl to the multitud  14  20 and they did all eat  and were fill  and they took up of the fragment that remain twelv basket full  14  21 and they that had eaten were about five thousand men  besid women and children  14  22 and straightway jesus constrain his discipl to get into a ship  and to go befor him unto the other side  while he sent the multitud away  14  23 and when he had sent the multitud away  he went up into a mountain apart to pray  and when the even was come  he was there alon  14  24 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea  toss with wave  for the wind was contrari  14  25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them  walk on the sea  14  26 and when the discipl saw him walk on the sea  they were troubl  say  it is a spirit  and they cri out for fear  14  27 but straightway jesus spake unto them  say  be of good cheer  it is i  be not afraid  14  28 and peter answer him and said  lord  if it be thou  bid me come unto thee on the water  14  29 and he said  come  and when peter was come down out of the ship  he walk on the water  to go to jesus  14  30 but when he saw the wind boister  he was afraid  and begin to sink  he cri  say  lord  save me  14  31 and immedi jesus stretch forth his hand  and caught him  and said unto him  o thou of littl faith  wherefor didst thou doubt  14  32 and when they were come into the ship  the wind ceas  14  33 then they that were in the ship came and worship him  say  of a truth thou art the son of god  14  34 and when they were gone over  they came into the land of gennesaret  14  35 and when the men of that place had knowledg of him  they sent out into all that countri round about  and brought unto him all that were diseas  14  36 and besought him that they might onli touch the hem of his garment  and as mani as touch were made perfect whole  15  1 then came to jesus scribe and pharise  which were of jerusalem  say  15  2 whi do thi discipl transgress the tradit of the elder  for they wash not their hand when they eat bread  15  3 but he answer and said unto them  whi do ye also transgress the command of god by your tradit  15  4 for god command  say  honour thi father and mother  and  he that curseth father or mother  let him die the death  15  5 but ye say  whosoev shall say to his father or his mother  it is a gift  by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me  15  6 and honour not his father or his mother  he shall be free  thus have ye made the command of god of none effect by your tradit  15  7 ye hypocrit  well did esaia prophesi of you  say  15  8 this peopl draweth nigh unto me with their mouth  and honoureth me with their lip  but their heart is far from me  15  9 but in vain they do worship me  teach for doctrin the command of men  15  10 and he call the multitud  and said unto them  hear  and understand  15  11 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man  but that which cometh out of the mouth  this defileth a man  15  12 then came his discipl  and said unto him  knowest thou that the pharise were offend  after they heard this say  15  13 but he answer and said  everi plant  which my heaven father hath not plant  shall be root up  15  14 let them alon  they be blind leader of the blind  and if the blind lead the blind  both shall fall into the ditch  15  15 then answer peter and said unto him  declar unto us this parabl  15  16 and jesus said  are ye also yet without understand  15  17 do not ye yet understand  that whatsoev entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belli  and is cast out into the draught  15  18 but those thing which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart  and they defil the man  15  19 for out of the heart proceed evil thought  murder  adulteri  fornic  theft  fals wit  blasphemi  15  20 these are the thing which defil a man  but to eat with unwashen hand defileth not a man  15  21 then jesus went thenc  and depart into the coast of tyre and sidon  15  22 and  behold  a woman of canaan came out of the same coast  and cri unto him  say  have merci on me  o lord  thou son of david  my daughter is grievous vex with a devil  15  23 but he answer her not a word  and his discipl came and besought him  say  send her away  for she crieth after us  15  24 but he answer and said  i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the hous of israel  15  25 then came she and worship him  say  lord  help me  15  26 but he answer and said  it is not meet to take the children  s bread  and to cast it to dog  15  27 and she said  truth  lord  yet the dog eat of the crumb which fall from their master  tabl  15  28 then jesus answer and said unto her  o woman  great is thi faith  be it unto thee even as thou wilt  and her daughter was made whole from that veri hour  15  29 and jesus depart from thenc  and came nigh unto the sea of galile  and went up into a mountain  and sat down there  15  30 and great multitud came unto him  have with them those that were lame  blind  dumb  maim  and mani other  and cast them down at jesus  feet  and he heal them  15  31 insomuch that the multitud wonder  when they saw the dumb to speak  the maim to be whole  the lame to walk  and the blind to see  and they glorifi the god of israel  15  32 then jesus call his discipl unto him  and said  i have compass on the multitud  becaus they continu with me now three day  and have noth to eat  and i will not send them away fast  lest they faint in the way  15  33 and his discipl say unto him  whenc should we have so much bread in the wilder  as to fill so great a multitud  15  34 and jesus saith unto them  how mani loav have ye  and they said  seven  and a few littl fish  15  35 and he command the multitud to sit down on the ground  15  36 and he took the seven loav and the fish  and gave thank  and brake them  and gave to his discipl  and the discipl to the multitud  15  37 and they did all eat  and were fill  and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven basket full  15  38 and they that did eat were four thousand men  besid women and children  15  39 and he sent away the multitud  and took ship  and came into the coast of magdala  16  1 the pharise also with the sadduce came  and tempt desir him that he would shew them a sign from heaven  16  2 he answer and said unto them  when it is even  ye say  it will be fair weather  for the sky is red  16  3 and in the morn  it will be foul weather to day  for the sky is red and lower  o ye hypocrit  ye can discern the face of the sky  but can ye not discern the sign of the time  16  4 a wick and adulter generat seeketh after a sign  and there shall no sign be given unto it  but the sign of the prophet jona  and he left them  and depart  16  5 and when his discipl were come to the other side  they had forgotten to take bread  16  6 then jesus said unto them  take heed and bewar of the leaven of the pharise and of the sadduce  16  7 and they reason among themselv  say  it is becaus we have taken no bread  16  8 which when jesus perceiv  he said unto them  o ye of littl faith  whi reason ye among yourselv  becaus ye have brought no bread  16  9 do ye not yet understand  neither rememb the five loav of the five thousand  and how mani basket ye took up  16  10 neither the seven loav of the four thousand  and how mani basket ye took up  16  11 how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concern bread  that ye should bewar of the leaven of the pharise and of the sadduce  16  12 then understood they how that he bade them not bewar of the leaven of bread  but of the doctrin of the pharise and of the sadduce  16  13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi  he ask his discipl  say  whom do men say that i the son of man am  16  14 and they said  some say that thou art john the baptist  some  elia  and other  jeremia  or one of the prophet  16  15 he saith unto them  but whom say ye that i am  16  16 and simon peter answer and said  thou art the christ  the son of the live god  16  17 and jesus answer and said unto him  bless art thou  simon barjona  for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee  but my father which is in heaven  16  18 and i say also unto thee  that thou art peter  and upon this rock i will build my church  and the gate of hell shall not prevail against it  16  19 and i will give unto thee the key of the kingdom of heaven  and whatsoev thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven  and whatsoev thou shalt loos on earth shall be loos in heaven  16  20 then charg he his discipl that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ  16  21 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his discipl  how that he must go unto jerusalem  and suffer mani thing of the elder and chief priest and scribe  and be kill  and be rais again the third day  16  22 then peter took him  and began to rebuk him  say  be it far from thee  lord  this shall not be unto thee  16  23 but he turn  and said unto peter  get thee behind me  satan  thou art an offenc unto me  for thou savourest not the thing that be of god  but those that be of men  16  24 then said jesus unto his discipl  if ani man will come after me  let him deni himself  and take up his cross  and follow me  16  25 for whosoev will save his life shall lose it  and whosoev will lose his life for my sake shall find it  16  26 for what is a man profit  if he shall gain the whole world  and lose his own soul  or what shall a man give in exchang for his soul  16  27 for the son of man shall come in the glori of his father with his angel  and then he shall reward everi man accord to his work  16  28 verili i say unto you  there be some stand here  which shall not tast of death  till they see the son of man come in his kingdom  17  1 and after six day jesus taketh peter  jame  and john his brother  and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart  17  2 and was transfigur befor them  and his face did shine as the sun  and his raiment was white as the light  17  3 and  behold  there appear unto them mose and elia talk with him  17  4 then answer peter  and said unto jesus  lord  it is good for us to be here  if thou wilt  let us make here three tabernacl  one for thee  and one for mose  and one for elia  17  5 while he yet spake  behold  a bright cloud overshadow them  and behold a voic out of the cloud  which said  this is my belov son  in whom i am well pleas  hear ye him  17  6 and when the discipl heard it  they fell on their face  and were sore afraid  17  7 and jesus came and touch them  and said  aris  and be not afraid  17  8 and when they had lift up their eye  they saw no man  save jesus onli  17  9 and as they came down from the mountain  jesus charg them  say  tell the vision to no man  until the son of man be risen again from the dead  17  10 and his discipl ask him  say  whi then say the scribe that elia must first come  17  11 and jesus answer and said unto them  elia truli shall first come  and restor all thing  17  12 but i say unto you  that elia is come alreadi  and they knew him not  but have done unto him whatsoev they list  likewis shall also the son of man suffer of them  17  13 then the discipl understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist  17  14 and when they were come to the multitud  there came to him a certain man  kneel down to him  and say  17  15 lord  have merci on my son  for he is lunatick  and sore vex  for ofttim he falleth into the fire  and oft into the water  17  16 and i brought him to thi discipl  and they could not cure him  17  17 then jesus answer and said  o faithless and pervers generat  how long shall i be with you  how long shall i suffer you  bring him hither to me  17  18 and jesus rebuk the devil  and he depart out of him  and the child was cure from that veri hour  17  19 then came the discipl to jesus apart  and said  whi could not we cast him out  17  20 and jesus said unto them  becaus of your unbelief  for verili i say unto you  if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed  ye shall say unto this mountain  remov henc to yonder place  and it shall remov  and noth shall be imposs unto you  17  21 howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast  17  22 and while they abod in galile  jesus said unto them  the son of man shall be betray into the hand of men  17  23 and they shall kill him  and the third day he shall be rais again  and they were exceed sorri  17  24 and when they were come to capernaum  they that receiv tribut money came to peter  and said  doth not your master pay tribut  17  25 he saith  yes  and when he was come into the hous  jesus prevent him  say  what thinkest thou  simon  of whom do the king of the earth take custom or tribut  of their own children  or of stranger  17  26 peter saith unto him  of stranger  jesus saith unto him  then are the children free  17  27 notwithstand  lest we should offend them  go thou to the sea  and cast an hook  and take up the fish that first cometh up  and when thou hast open his mouth  thou shalt find a piec of money  that take  and give unto them for me and thee  18  1 at the same time came the discipl unto jesus  say  who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven  18  2 and jesus call a littl child unto him  and set him in the midst of them  18  3 and said  verili i say unto you  except ye be convert  and becom as littl children  ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven  18  4 whosoev therefor shall humbl himself as this littl child  the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven  18  5 and whoso shall receiv one such littl child in my name receiveth me  18  6 but whoso shall offend one of these littl one which believ in me  it were better for him that a millston were hang about his neck  and that he were drown in the depth of the sea  18  7 woe unto the world becaus of offenc  for it must need be that offenc come  but woe to that man by whom the offenc cometh  18  8 wherefor if thi hand or thi foot offend thee  cut them off  and cast them from thee  it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maim  rather than have two hand or two feet to be cast into everlast fire  18  9 and if thine eye offend thee  pluck it out  and cast it from thee  it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye  rather than have two eye to be cast into hell fire  18  10 take heed that ye despis not one of these littl one  for i say unto you  that in heaven their angel do alway behold the face of my father which is in heaven  18  11 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost  18  12 how think ye  if a man have an hundr sheep  and one of them be gone astray  doth he not leav the nineti and nine  and goeth into the mountain  and seeketh that which is gone astray  18  13 and if so be that he find it  verili i say unto you  he rejoiceth more of that sheep  than of the nineti and nine which went not astray  18  14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven  that one of these littl one should perish  18  15 moreov if thi brother shall trespass against thee  go and tell him his fault between thee and him alon  if he shall hear thee  thou hast gain thi brother  18  16 but if he will not hear thee  then take with thee one or two more  that in the mouth of two or three wit everi word may be establish  18  17 and if he shall neglect to hear them  tell it unto the church  but if he neglect to hear the church  let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican  18  18 verili i say unto you  whatsoev ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven  and whatsoev ye shall loos on earth shall be loos in heaven  18  19 again i say unto you  that if two of you shall agre on earth as touch ani thing that they shall ask  it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven  18  20 for where two or three are gather togeth in my name  there am i in the midst of them  18  21 then came peter to him  and said  lord  how oft shall my brother sin against me  and i forgiv him  till seven time  18  22 jesus saith unto him  i say not unto thee  until seven time  but  until seventi time seven  18  23 therefor is the kingdom of heaven liken unto a certain king  which would take account of his servant  18  24 and when he had begun to reckon  one was brought unto him  which owe him ten thousand talent  18  25 but forasmuch as he had not to pay  his lord command him to be sold  and his wife  and children  and all that he had  and payment to be made  18  26 the servant therefor fell down  and worship him  say  lord  have patienc with me  and i will pay thee all  18  27 then the lord of that servant was move with compass  and loos him  and forgav him the debt  18  28 but the same servant went out  and found one of his fellowserv  which owe him an hundr penc  and he laid hand on him  and took him by the throat  say  pay me that thou owest  18  29 and his fellowserv fell down at his feet  and besought him  say  have patienc with me  and i will pay thee all  18  30 and he would not  but went and cast him into prison  till he should pay the debt  18  31 so when his fellowserv saw what was done  they were veri sorri  and came and told unto their lord all that was done  18  32 then his lord  after that he had call him  said unto him  o thou wick servant  i forgav thee all that debt  becaus thou desiredst me  18  33 shouldest not thou also have had compass on thi fellowserv  even as i had piti on thee  18  34 and his lord was wroth  and deliv him to the tormentor  till he should pay all that was due unto him  18  35 so likewis shall my heaven father do also unto you  if ye from your heart forgiv not everi one his brother their trespass  19  1 and it came to pass  that when jesus had finish these say  he depart from galile  and came into the coast of judaea beyond jordan  19  2 and great multitud follow him  and he heal them there  19  3 the pharise also came unto him  tempt him  and say unto him  is it law for a man to put away his wife for everi caus  19  4 and he answer and said unto them  have ye not read  that he which made them at the begin made them male and femal  19  5 and said  for this caus shall a man leav father and mother  and shall cleav to his wife  and they twain shall be one flesh  19  6 wherefor they are no more twain  but one flesh  what therefor god hath join togeth  let not man put asund  19  7 they say unto him  whi did mose then command to give a write of divorc  and to put her away  19  8 he saith unto them  mose becaus of the hard of your heart suffer you to put away your wive  but from the begin it was not so  19  9 and i say unto you  whosoev shall put away his wife  except it be for fornic  and shall marri anoth  committeth adulteri  and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adulteri  19  10 his discipl say unto him  if the case of the man be so with his wife  it is not good to marri  19  11 but he said unto them  all men cannot receiv this say  save they to whom it is given  19  12 for there are some eunuch  which were so born from their mother  s womb  and there are some eunuch  which were made eunuch of men  and there be eunuch  which have made themselv eunuch for the kingdom of heaven  s sake  he that is abl to receiv it  let him receiv it  19  13 then were there brought unto him littl children  that he should put his hand on them  and pray  and the discipl rebuk them  19  14 but jesus said  suffer littl children  and forbid them not  to come unto me  for of such is the kingdom of heaven  19  15 and he laid his hand on them  and depart thenc  19  16 and  behold  one came and said unto him  good master  what good thing shall i do  that i may have etern life  19  17 and he said unto him  whi callest thou me good  there is none good but one  that is  god  but if thou wilt enter into life  keep the command  19  18 he saith unto him  which  jesus said  thou shalt do no murder  thou shalt not commit adulteri  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not bear fals wit  19  19 honour thi father and thi mother  and  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  19  20 the young man saith unto him  all these thing have i kept from my youth up  what lack i yet  19  21 jesus said unto him  if thou wilt be perfect  go and sell that thou hast  and give to the poor  and thou shalt have treasur in heaven  and come and follow me  19  22 but when the young man heard that say  he went away sorrow  for he had great possess  19  23 then said jesus unto his discipl  verili i say unto you  that a rich man shall hard enter into the kingdom of heaven  19  24 and again i say unto you  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needl  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  19  25 when his discipl heard it  they were exceed amaz  say  who then can be save  19  26 but jesus beheld them  and said unto them  with men this is imposs  but with god all thing are possibl  19  27 then answer peter and said unto him  behold  we have forsaken all  and follow thee  what shall we have therefor  19  28 and jesus said unto them  verili i say unto you  that ye which have follow me  in the regener when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glori  ye also shall sit upon twelv throne  judg the twelv tribe of israel  19  29 and everi one that hath forsaken hous  or brethren  or sister  or father  or mother  or wife  or children  or land  for my name  s sake  shall receiv an hundredfold  and shall inherit everlast life  19  30 but mani that are first shall be last  and the last shall be first  20  1 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an household  which went out earli in the morn to hire labour into his vineyard  20  2 and when he had agre with the labour for a penni a day  he sent them into his vineyard  20  3 and he went out about the third hour  and saw other stand idl in the marketplac  20  4 and said unto them  go ye also into the vineyard  and whatsoev is right i will give you  and they went their way  20  5 again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour  and did likewis  20  6 and about the eleventh hour he went out  and found other stand idl  and saith unto them  whi stand ye here all the day idl  20  7 they say unto him  becaus no man hath hire us  he saith unto them  go ye also into the vineyard  and whatsoev is right  that shall ye receiv  20  8 so when even was come  the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward  call the labour  and give them their hire  begin from the last unto the first  20  9 and when they came that were hire about the eleventh hour  they receiv everi man a penni  20  10 but when the first came  they suppos that they should have receiv more  and they likewis receiv everi man a penni  20  11 and when they had receiv it  they murmur against the goodman of the hous  20  12 say  these last have wrought but one hour  and thou hast made them equal unto us  which have born the burden and heat of the day  20  13 but he answer one of them  and said  friend  i do thee no wrong  didst not thou agre with me for a penni  20  14 take that thine is  and go thi way  i will give unto this last  even as unto thee  20  15 is it not law for me to do what i will with mine own  is thine eye evil  becaus i am good  20  16 so the last shall be first  and the first last  for mani be call  but few chosen  20  17 and jesus go up to jerusalem took the twelv discipl apart in the way  and said unto them  20  18 behold  we go up to jerusalem  and the son of man shall be betray unto the chief priest and unto the scribe  and they shall condemn him to death  20  19 and shall deliv him to the gentil to mock  and to scourg  and to crucifi him  and the third day he shall rise again  20  20 then came to him the mother of zebede children with her son  worship him  and desir a certain thing of him  20  21 and he said unto her  what wilt thou  she saith unto him  grant that these my two son may sit  the one on thi right hand  and the other on the left  in thi kingdom  20  22 but jesus answer and said  ye know not what ye ask  are ye abl to drink of the cup that i shall drink of  and to be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with  they say unto him  we are abl  20  23 and he saith unto them  ye shall drink inde of my cup  and be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with  but to sit on my right hand  and on my left  is not mine to give  but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepar of my father  20  24 and when the ten heard it  they were move with indign against the two brethren  20  25 but jesus call them unto him  and said  ye know that the princ of the gentil exercis dominion over them  and they that are great exercis author upon them  20  26 but it shall not be so among you  but whosoev will be great among you  let him be your minist  20  27 and whosoev will be chief among you  let him be your servant  20  28 even as the son of man came not to be minist unto  but to minist  and to give his life a ransom for mani  20  29 and as they depart from jericho  a great multitud follow him  20  30 and  behold  two blind men sit by the way side  when they heard that jesus pass by  cri out  say  have merci on us  o lord  thou son of david  20  31 and the multitud rebuk them  becaus they should hold their peac  but they cri the more  say  have merci on us  o lord  thou son of david  20  32 and jesus stood still  and call them  and said  what will ye that i shall do unto you  20  33 they say unto him  lord  that our eye may be open  20  34 so jesus had compass on them  and touch their eye  and immedi their eye receiv sight  and they follow him  21  1 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem  and were come to bethphag  unto the mount of oliv  then sent jesus two discipl  21  2 say unto them  go into the villag over against you  and straightway ye shall find an ass tie  and a colt with her  loos them  and bring them unto me  21  3 and if ani man say ought unto you  ye shall say  the lord hath need of them  and straightway he will send them  21  4 all this was done  that it might be fulfil which was spoken by the prophet  say  21  5 tell ye the daughter of sion  behold  thi king cometh unto thee  meek  and sit upon an ass  and a colt the foal of an ass  21  6 and the discipl went  and did as jesus command them  21  7 and brought the ass  and the colt  and put on them their cloth  and they set him thereon  21  8 and a veri great multitud spread their garment in the way  other cut down branch from the tree  and straw them in the way  21  9 and the multitud that went befor  and that follow  cri  say  hosanna to the son of david  bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord  hosanna in the highest  21  10 and when he was come into jerusalem  all the citi was move  say  who is this  21  11 and the multitud said  this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galile  21  12 and jesus went into the templ of god  and cast out all them that sold and bought in the templ  and overthrew the tabl of the moneychang  and the seat of them that sold dove  21  13 and said unto them  it is written  my hous shall be call the hous of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thiev  21  14 and the blind and the lame came to him in the templ  and he heal them  21  15 and when the chief priest and scribe saw the wonder thing that he did  and the children cri in the templ  and say  hosanna to the son of david  they were sore displeas  21  16 and said unto him  hearest thou what these say  and jesus saith unto them  yea  have ye never read  out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou hast perfect prais  21  17 and he left them  and went out of the citi into bethani  and he lodg there  21  18 now in the morn as he return into the citi  he hunger  21  19 and when he saw a fig tree in the way  he came to it  and found noth thereon  but leav onli  and said unto it  let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever  and present the fig tree wither away  21  20 and when the discipl saw it  they marvel  say  how soon is the fig tree wither away  21  21 jesus answer and said unto them  verili i say unto you  if ye have faith  and doubt not  ye shall not onli do this which is done to the fig tree  but also if ye shall say unto this mountain  be thou remov  and be thou cast into the sea  it shall be done  21  22 and all thing  whatsoev ye shall ask in prayer  believ  ye shall receiv  21  23 and when he was come into the templ  the chief priest and the elder of the peopl came unto him as he was teach  and said  by what author doest thou these thing  and who gave thee this author  21  24 and jesus answer and said unto them  i also will ask you one thing  which if ye tell me  i in like wise will tell you by what author i do these thing  21  25 the baptism of john  whenc was it  from heaven  or of men  and they reason with themselv  say  if we shall say  from heaven  he will say unto us  whi did ye not then believ him  21  26 but if we shall say  of men  we fear the peopl  for all hold john as a prophet  21  27 and they answer jesus  and said  we cannot tell  and he said unto them  neither tell i you by what author i do these thing  21  28 but what think ye  a certain man had two son  and he came to the first  and said  son  go work to day in my vineyard  21  29 he answer and said  i will not  but afterward he repent  and went  21  30 and he came to the second  and said likewis  and he answer and said  i go  sir  and went not  21  31 whether of them twain did the will of his father  they say unto him  the first  jesus saith unto them  verili i say unto you  that the publican and the harlot go into the kingdom of god befor you  21  32 for john came unto you in the way of righteous  and ye believ him not  but the publican and the harlot believ him  and ye  when ye had seen it  repent not afterward  that ye might believ him  21  33 hear anoth parabl  there was a certain household  which plant a vineyard  and hedg it round about  and dig a winepress in it  and built a tower  and let it out to husbandmen  and went into a far countri  21  34 and when the time of the fruit drew near  he sent his servant to the husbandmen  that they might receiv the fruit of it  21  35 and the husbandmen took his servant  and beat one  and kill anoth  and stone anoth  21  36 again  he sent other servant more than the first  and they did unto them likewis  21  37 but last of all he sent unto them his son  say  they will rever my son  21  38 but when the husbandmen saw the son  they said among themselv  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  and let us seiz on his inherit  21  39 and they caught him  and cast him out of the vineyard  and slew him  21  40 when the lord therefor of the vineyard cometh  what will he do unto those husbandmen  21  41 they say unto him  he will miser destroy those wick men  and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen  which shall render him the fruit in their season  21  42 jesus saith unto them  did ye never read in the scriptur  the stone which the builder reject  the same is becom the head of the corner  this is the lord  s do  and it is marvel in our eye  21  43 therefor say i unto you  the kingdom of god shall be taken from you  and given to a nation bring forth the fruit thereof  21  44 and whosoev shall fall on this stone shall be broken  but on whomsoev it shall fall  it will grind him to powder  21  45 and when the chief priest and pharise had heard his parabl  they perceiv that he spake of them  21  46 but when they sought to lay hand on him  they fear the multitud  becaus they took him for a prophet  22  1 and jesus answer and spake unto them again by parabl  and said  22  2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king  which made a marriag for his son  22  3 and sent forth his servant to call them that were bidden to the wed  and they would not come  22  4 again  he sent forth other servant  say  tell them which are bidden  behold  i have prepar my dinner  my oxen and my fatl are kill  and all thing are readi  come unto the marriag  22  5 but they made light of it  and went their way  one to his farm  anoth to his merchandis  22  6 and the remnant took his servant  and entreat them spite  and slew them  22  7 but when the king heard thereof  he was wroth  and he sent forth his armi  and destroy those murder  and burn up their citi  22  8 then saith he to his servant  the wed is readi  but they which were bidden were not worthi  22  9 go ye therefor into the highway  and as mani as ye shall find  bid to the marriag  22  10 so those servant went out into the highway  and gather togeth all as mani as they found  both bad and good  and the wed was furnish with guest  22  11 and when the king came in to see the guest  he saw there a man which had not on a wed garment  22  12 and he saith unto him  friend  how camest thou in hither not have a wed garment  and he was speechless  22  13 then said the king to the servant  bind him hand and foot  and take him away  and cast him into outer dark  there shall be weep and gnash of teeth  22  14 for mani are call  but few are chosen  22  15 then went the pharise  and took counsel how they might entangl him in his talk  22  16 and they sent out unto him their discipl with the herodian  say  master  we know that thou art true  and teachest the way of god in truth  neither carest thou for ani man  for thou regardest not the person of men  22  17 tell us therefor  what thinkest thou  is it law to give tribut unto caesar  or not  22  18 but jesus perceiv their wicked  and said  whi tempt ye me  ye hypocrit  22  19 shew me the tribut money  and they brought unto him a penni  22  20 and he saith unto them  whose is this imag and superscript  22  21 they say unto him  caesar  s  then saith he unto them  render therefor unto caesar the thing which are caesar  s  and unto god the thing that are god  s  22  22 when they had heard these word  they marvel  and left him  and went their way  22  23 the same day came to him the sadduce  which say that there is no resurrect  and ask him  22  24 say  master  mose said  if a man die  have no children  his brother shall marri his wife  and rais up seed unto his brother  22  25 now there were with us seven brethren  and the first  when he had marri a wife  deceas  and  have no issu  left his wife unto his brother  22  26 likewis the second also  and the third  unto the seventh  22  27 and last of all the woman die also  22  28 therefor in the resurrect whose wife shall she be of the seven  for they all had her  22  29 jesus answer and said unto them  ye do err  not know the scriptur  nor the power of god  22  30 for in the resurrect they neither marri  nor are given in marriag  but are as the angel of god in heaven  22  31 but as touch the resurrect of the dead  have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god  say  22  32 i am the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  god is not the god of the dead  but of the live  22  33 and when the multitud heard this  they were astonish at his doctrin  22  34 but when the pharise had heard that he had put the sadduce to silenc  they were gather togeth  22  35 then one of them  which was a lawyer  ask him a question  tempt him  and say  22  36 master  which is the great command in the law  22  37 jesus said unto him  thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi heart  and with all thi soul  and with all thi mind  22  38 this is the first and great command  22  39 and the second is like unto it  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  22  40 on these two command hang all the law and the prophet  22  41 while the pharise were gather togeth  jesus ask them  22  42 say  what think ye of christ  whose son is he  they say unto him  the son of david  22  43 he saith unto them  how then doth david in spirit call him lord  say  22  44 the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine enemi thi footstool  22  45 if david then call him lord  how is he his son  22  46 and no man was abl to answer him a word  neither durst ani man from that day forth ask him ani more question  23  1 then spake jesus to the multitud  and to his discipl  23  2 say the scribe and the pharise sit in mose  seat  23  3 all therefor whatsoev they bid you observ  that observ and do  but do not ye after their work  for they say  and do not  23  4 for they bind heavi burden and grievous to be born  and lay them on men  s shoulder  but they themselv will not move them with one of their finger  23  5 but all their work they do for to be seen of men  they make broad their phylacteri  and enlarg the border of their garment  23  6 and love the uppermost room at feast  and the chief seat in the synagogu  23  7 and greet in the market  and to be call of men  rabbi  rabbi  23  8 but be not ye call rabbi  for one is your master  even christ  and all ye are brethren  23  9 and call no man your father upon the earth  for one is your father  which is in heaven  23  10 neither be ye call master  for one is your master  even christ  23  11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant  23  12 and whosoev shall exalt himself shall be abas  and he that shall humbl himself shall be exalt  23  13 but woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men  for ye neither go in yourselv  neither suffer ye them that are enter to go in  23  14 woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye devour widow  hous  and for a pretenc make long prayer  therefor ye shall receiv the greater damnat  23  15 woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye

23  25 woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye make clean the outsid of the cup and of the platter  but within they are full of extort and excess  23  26 thou blind pharise  cleans first that which is within the cup and platter  that the outsid of them may be clean also  23  27 woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye are like unto white sepulchr  which inde appear beauti

scribe and pharise  hypocrit  becaus ye build the tomb of the prophet  and garnish the sepulchr of the righteous  23  30 and say  if we had been in the day of our father  we would not have been partak with them in the blood of the prophet  23  31 wherefor ye be wit unto yourselv  that ye are the children of them which kill the prophet  23  32 fill ye up then the measur of your father  23  33 ye

the templ  and his discipl came to him for to shew him the build of the templ  24  2 and jesus said unto them  see ye not all these thing  verili i say unto you  there shall not be left here one stone upon anoth  that shall not be thrown down  24  3 and as he sat upon the mount of oliv  the discipl came unto him privat  say  tell us  when shall these thing be  and what shall be the sign of thi come  and of the end of the world  24  4 and jesus answer and said unto them  take heed that no man deceiv you  24  5 for mani shall come in my name  say  i am christ  and shall deceiv mani  24  6 and ye shall hear of war and rumour of war  see that ye be not troubl  for all these thing must come to pass  but the end is not yet  24  7 for nation shall rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  and there shall be famin  and pestil  and earthquak  in diver place  24  8 all these are the begin of sorrow  24  9 then shall they deliv you up to be afflict  and shall kill you  and ye shall be hate of all nation for my name  s sake  24  10 and then shall mani be offend  and shall betray one anoth  and shall hate one anoth  24  11 and mani fals prophet shall rise  and shall deceiv mani  24  12 and becaus iniqu shall abound  the love of mani shall wax cold  24  13 but he that shall endur unto the end  the same shall be save  24  14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preach in all the world for a wit unto all nation  and then shall the end come  24  15 when ye therefor shall see the abomin of desol  spoken of by daniel the prophet  stand in the holi place   whoso readeth  let him understand  24  16 then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountain  24  17 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take ani thing out of his hous  24  18 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his cloth  24  19 and woe unto them that are with child  and to them that give suck in those day  24  20 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter  neither on the sabbath day  24  21 for then shall be great tribul  such as was not sinc the begin of the world to this time  no  nor ever shall be  24  22 and except those day should be shorten  there should no flesh be save  but for the elect  s sake those day shall be shorten  24  23 then if ani man shall say unto you  lo  here is christ  or there  believ it not  24  24 for there shall aris fals christ  and fals prophet  and shall shew great sign and wonder  insomuch that  if it were possibl  they shall deceiv the veri elect  24  25 behold  i have told you befor  24  26 wherefor if they shall say unto you  behold  he is in the desert  go not forth  behold  he is in the secret chamber  believ it not  24  27 for as the lightn cometh out of the east  and shineth even unto the west  so shall also the come of the son of man be  24  28 for wheresoev the carcas is  there will the eagl be gather togeth  24  29 immedi after the tribul of those day shall the sun be darken  and the moon shall not give her light  and the star shall fall from heaven  and the power of the heaven shall be shaken  24  30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven  and then shall all the tribe of the earth mourn  and they shall see the son of man come in the cloud of heaven with power and great glori  24  31 and he shall send his angel with a great sound of a trumpet  and they shall gather togeth his elect from the four wind  from one end of heaven to the other  24  32 now learn a parabl of the fig tree  when his branch is yet tender  and putteth forth leav  ye know that summer is nigh  24  33 so likewis ye  when ye shall see all these thing  know that it is near  even at the door  24  34 verili i say unto you  this generat shall not pass  till all these thing be fulfil  24  35 heaven and earth shall pass away  but my word shall not pass away  24  36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man  no  not the angel of heaven  but my father onli  24  37 but as the day of noe were  so shall also the come of the son of man be  24  38 for as in the day that were befor the flood they were eat and drink  marri and give in marriag  until the day that noe enter into the ark  24  39 and knew not until the flood came  and took them all away  so shall also the come of the son of man be  24  40 then shall two be in the field  the one shall be taken  and the other left  24  41 two women shall be grind at the mill  the one shall be taken  and the other left  24  42 watch therefor  for ye know not what hour your lord doth come  24  43 but know this  that if the goodman of the hous had known in what watch the thief would come  he would have watch  and would not have suffer his hous to be broken up  24  44 therefor be ye also readi  for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh  24  45 who then is a faith and wise servant  whom his lord hath made ruler over his household  to give them meat in due season  24  46 bless is that servant  whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do  24  47 verili i say unto you  that he shall make him ruler over all his good  24  48 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart  my lord delayeth his come  24  49 and shall begin to smite his fellowserv  and to eat and drink with the drunken  24  50 the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him  and in an hour that he is not awar of  24  51 and shall cut him asund  and appoint him his portion with the hypocrit  there shall be weep and gnash of teeth  25  1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be liken unto ten virgin  which took their lamp  and went forth to meet the bridegroom  25  2 and five of them were wise  and five were foolish  25  3 they that were foolish took their lamp  and took no oil with them  25  4 but the wise took oil in their vessel with their lamp  25  5 while the bridegroom tarri  they all slumber and slept  25  6 and at midnight there was a cri made  behold  the bridegroom cometh  go ye out to meet him  25  7 then all those virgin aros  and trim their lamp  25  8 and the foolish said unto the wise  give us of your oil  for our lamp are gone out  25  9 but the wise answer  say  not so  lest there be not enough for us and you  but go ye rather to them that sell  and buy for yourselv  25  10 and while they went to buy  the bridegroom came  and they that were readi went in with him to the marriag  and the door was shut  25  11 afterward came also the other virgin  say  lord  lord  open to us  25  12 but he answer and said  verili i say unto you  i know you not  25  13 watch therefor  for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh  25  14 for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travel into a far countri  who call his own servant  and deliv unto them his good  25  15 and unto one he gave five talent  to anoth two  and to anoth one  to everi man accord to his sever abil  and straightway took his journey  25  16 then he that had receiv the five talent went and trade with the same  and made them other five talent  25  17 and likewis he that had receiv two  he also gain other two  25  18 but he that had receiv one went and dig in the earth  and hid his lord  s money  25  19 after a long time the lord of those servant cometh  and reckoneth with them  25  20 and so he that had receiv five talent came and brought other five talent  say  lord  thou deliveredst unto me five talent  behold  i have gain besid them five talent more  25  21 his lord said unto him  well done  thou good and faith servant  thou hast been faith over a few thing  i will make thee ruler over mani thing  enter thou into the joy of thi lord  25  22 he also that had receiv two talent came and said  lord  thou deliveredst unto me two talent  behold  i have gain two other talent besid them  25  23 his lord said unto him  well done  good and faith servant  thou hast been faith over a few thing  i will make thee ruler over mani thing  enter thou into the joy of thi lord  25  24 then he which had receiv the one talent came and said  lord  i knew thee that thou art an hard man  reap where thou hast not sown  and gather where thou hast not straw  25  25 and i was afraid  and went and hid thi talent in the earth  lo  there thou hast that is thine  25  26 his lord answer and said unto him  thou wick and sloth servant  thou knewest that i reap where i sow not  and gather where i have not straw  25  27 thou oughtest therefor to have put my money to the exchang  and then at my come i should have receiv mine own with usuri  25  28 take therefor the talent from him  and give it unto him which hath ten talent  25  29 for unto everi one that hath shall be given  and he shall have abund  but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath  25  30 and cast ye the unprofit servant into outer dark  there shall be weep and gnash of teeth  25  31 when the son of man shall come in his glori  and all the holi angel with him  then shall he sit upon the throne of his glori  25  32 and befor him shall be gather all nation  and he shall separ them one from anoth  as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goat  25  33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand  but the goat on the left  25  34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand  come  ye bless of my father  inherit the kingdom prepar for you from the foundat of the world  25  35 for i was an hungr  and ye gave me meat  i was thirsti  and ye gave me drink  i was a stranger  and ye took me in  25  36 nake  and ye cloth me  i was sick  and ye visit me  i was in prison  and ye came unto me  25  37 then shall the righteous answer him  say  lord  when saw we thee an hungr  and fed thee  or thirsti  and gave thee drink  25  38 when saw we thee a stranger  and took thee in  or nake  and cloth thee  25  39 or when saw we thee sick  or in prison  and came unto thee  25  40 and the king shall answer and say unto them  verili i say unto you  inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren  ye have done it unto me  25  41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand  depart from me  ye curs  into everlast fire  prepar for the devil and his angel  25  42 for i was an hungr  and ye gave me no meat  i was thirsti  and ye gave me no drink  25  43 i was a stranger  and ye took me not in  nake  and ye cloth me not  sick  and in prison  and ye visit me not  25  44 then shall they also answer him  say  lord  when saw we thee an hungr  or athirst  or a stranger  or nake  or sick  or in prison  and did not minist unto thee  25  45 then shall he answer them  say  verili i say unto you  inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these  ye did it not to me  25  46 and these shall go away into everlast punish  but the righteous into life etern  26  1 and it came to pass  when jesus had finish all these say  he said unto his discipl  26  2 ye know that after two day is the feast of the passov  and the son of man is betray to be crucifi  26  3 then assembl togeth the chief priest  and the scribe  and the elder of the peopl  unto the palac of the high priest  who was call caiapha  26  4 and consult that they might take jesus by subtilti  and kill him  26  5 but they said  not on the feast day  lest there be an uproar among the peopl  26  6 now when jesus was in bethani  in the hous of simon the leper  26  7 there came unto him a woman have an alabast box of veri precious ointment  and pour it on his head  as he sat at meat  26  8 but when his discipl saw it  they had indign  say  to what purpos is this wast  26  9 for this ointment might have been sold for much  and given to the poor  26  10 when jesus understood it  he said unto them  whi troubl ye the woman  for she hath wrought a good work upon me  26  11 for ye have the poor alway with you  but me ye have not alway  26  12 for in that she hath pour this ointment on my bodi  she did it for my burial  26  13 verili i say unto you  wheresoev this gospel shall be preach in the whole world  there shall also this  that this woman hath done  be told for a memori of her  26  14 then one of the twelv  call juda iscariot  went unto the chief priest  26  15 and said unto them  what will ye give me  and i will deliv him unto you  and they coven with him for thirti piec of silver  26  16 and from that time he sought opportun to betray him  26  17 now the first day of the feast of unleaven bread the discipl came to jesus  say unto him  where wilt thou that we prepar for thee to eat the passov  26  18 and he said  go into the citi to such a man  and say unto him  the master saith  my time is at hand  i will keep the passov at thi hous with my discipl  26  19 and the discipl did as jesus had appoint them  and they made readi the passov  26  20 now when the even was come  he sat down with the twelv  26  21 and as they did eat  he said  verili i say unto you  that one of you shall betray me  26  22 and they were exceed sorrow  and began everi one of them to say unto him  lord  is it i  26  23 and he answer and said  he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish  the same shall betray me  26  24 the son of man goeth as it is written of him  but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betray  it had been good for that man if he had not been born  26  25 then juda  which betray him  answer and said  master  is it i  he said unto him  thou hast said  26  26 and as they were eat  jesus took bread  and bless it  and brake it  and gave it to the discipl  and said  take  eat  this is my bodi  26  27 and he took the cup  and gave thank  and gave it to them  say  drink ye all of it  26  28 for this is my blood of the new testament  which is shed for mani for the remiss of sin  26  29 but i say unto you  i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine  until that day when i drink it new with you in my father  s kingdom  26  30 and when they had sung an hymn  they went out into the mount of oliv  26  31 then saith jesus unto them  all ye shall be offend becaus of me this night  for it is written  i will smite the shepherd  and the sheep of the flock shall be scatter abroad  26  32 but after i am risen again  i will go befor you into galile  26  33 peter answer and said unto him  though all men shall be offend becaus of thee  yet will i never be offend  26  34 jesus said unto him  verili i say unto thee  that this night  befor the cock crow  thou shalt deni me thrice  26  35 peter said unto him  though i should die with thee  yet will i not deni thee  likewis also said all the discipl  26  36 then cometh jesus with them unto a place call gethseman  and saith unto the discipl  sit ye here  while i go and pray yonder  26  37 and he took with him peter and the two son of zebede  and began to be sorrow and veri heavi  26  38 then saith he unto them  my soul is exceed sorrow  even unto death  tarri ye here  and watch with me  26  39 and he went a littl farther  and fell on his face  and pray  say  o my father  if it be possibl  let this cup pass from me  nevertheless not as i will  but as thou wilt  26  40 and he cometh unto the discipl  and findeth them asleep  and saith unto peter  what  could ye not watch with me one hour  26  41 watch and pray  that ye enter not into temptat  the spirit inde is will  but the flesh is weak  26  42 he went away again the second time  and pray  say  o my father  if this cup may not pass away from me  except i drink it  thi will be done  26  43 and he came and found them asleep again  for their eye were heavi  26  44 and he left them  and went away again  and pray the third time  say the same word  26  45 then cometh he to his discipl  and saith unto them  sleep on now  and take your rest  behold  the hour is at hand  and the son of man is betray into the hand of sinner  26  46 rise  let us be go  behold  he is at hand that doth betray me  26  47 and while he yet spake  lo  juda  one of the twelv  came  and with him a great multitud with sword and stave  from the chief priest and elder of the peopl  26  48 now he that betray him gave them a sign  say  whomsoev i shall kiss  that same is he  hold him fast  26  49 and forthwith he came to jesus  and said  hail  master  and kiss him  26  50 and jesus said unto him  friend  wherefor art thou come  then came they  and laid hand on jesus and took him  26  51 and  behold  one of them which were with jesus stretch out his hand  and drew his sword  and struck a servant of the high priest  s  and smote off his ear  26  52 then said jesus unto him  put up again thi sword into his place  for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword  26  53 thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father  and he shall present give me more than twelv legion of angel  26  54 but how then shall the scriptur be fulfil  that thus it must be  26  55 in that same hour said jesus to the multitud  are ye come out as against a thief with sword and stave for to take me  i sat daili with you teach in the templ  and ye laid no hold on me  26  56 but all this was done  that the scriptur of the prophet might be fulfil  then all the discipl forsook him  and fled  26  57 and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiapha the high priest  where the scribe and the elder were assembl  26  58 but peter follow him afar off unto the high priest  s palac  and went in  and sat with the servant  to see the end  26  59 now the chief priest  and elder  and all the council  sought fals wit against jesus  to put him to death  26  60 but found none  yea  though mani fals wit came  yet found they none  at the last came two fals wit  26  61 and said  this fellow said  i am abl to destroy the templ of god  and to build it in three day  26  62 and the high priest aros  and said unto him  answerest thou noth  what is it which these wit against thee  26  63 but jesus held his peac  and the high priest answer and said unto him  i adjur thee by the live god  that thou tell us whether thou be the christ  the son of god  26  64 jesus saith unto him  thou hast said  nevertheless i say unto you  hereaft shall ye see the son of man sit on the right hand of power  and come in the cloud of heaven  26  65 then the high priest rent his cloth  say  he hath spoken blasphemi  what further need have we of wit  behold  now ye have heard his blasphemi  26  66 what think ye  they answer and said  he is guilti of death  26  67 then did they spit in his face  and buffet him  and other smote him with the palm of their hand  26  68 say  prophesi unto us  thou christ  who is he that smote thee  26  69 now peter sat without in the palac  and a damsel came unto him  say  thou also wast with jesus of galile  26  70 but he deni befor them all  say  i know not what thou sayest  26  71 and when he was gone out into the porch  anoth maid saw him  and said unto them that were there  this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth  26  72 and again he deni with an oath  i do not know the man  26  73 and after a while came unto him they that stood by  and said to peter  sure thou also art one of them  for thi speech bewrayeth thee  26  74 then began he to curs and to swear  say  i know not the man  and immedi the cock crew  26  75 and peter rememb the word of jesus  which said unto him  befor the cock crow  thou shalt deni me thrice  and he went out  and wept bitter  27  1 when the morn was come  all the chief priest and elder of the peopl took counsel against jesus to put him to death  27  2 and when they had bound him  they led him away  and deliv him to pontius pilat the governor  27  3 then juda  which had betray

likewis also the chief priest mock him  with the scribe and elder  said  27  42 he save other  himself he cannot save  if he be the king of israel  let him now come down from the cross  and we will believ him  27  43 he trust in god  let him deliv him now  if he will have him  for he said  i am the son of god  27  44 the thiev also  which were crucifi with him  cast the same in his teeth  27  45

what new doctrin is this  for with author commandeth he even the unclean spirit  and they do obey him  1  28 and immedi his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galile  1  29 and forthwith  when they were come out of the synagogu  they enter into the hous of simon and andrew  with jame and john  1  30 but simon  s wife  s mother lay sick of a fever  and anon they tell him of her  1  31 and he came and took her by the hand  and lift her up  and immedi the fever left her  and she minist unto them  1  32 and at even  when the sun did set  they brought unto him all that were

follow after him  1  37 and when they had found him  they said unto him  all men seek for thee  1  38 and he said unto them  let us go into the next town  that i may preach there also  for therefor came i forth  1  39 and he preach in their synagogu throughout all galile  and cast out devil  1  40 and there came a leper to him  beseech him  and kneel down to him  and say unto him  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  1  41 and jesus  move with compass  put forth his hand  and touch him  and saith unto him  i will  be thou clean  1  42 and as soon as he had spoken  immedi the leprosi depart from him  and he was cleans  1  43 and he strait charg him  and forthwith sent him away  1  44 and saith unto him  see thou say noth to ani man  but go thi way  shew thyself to the priest  and offer for thi cleans those thing which mose command  for a testimoni unto them  1  45 but he went out  and began to publish it much  and to blaze abroad the matter  insomuch that jesus could no more open enter into the citi  but was without in desert place  and they came to him from everi quarter  2  1 and again he enter into capernaum after some day  and it was nois that he was in the hous  2  2 and straightway mani were gather togeth  insomuch that there was no room to receiv them  no  not so much as about the door  and he preach the word unto them  2  3 and they come unto him  bring one sick of the palsi  which was born of four  2  4 and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press  they uncov the roof where he was  and when they had broken it up  they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsi lay  2  5 when jesus saw their faith  he said unto the sick of the palsi  son  thi sin be forgiven thee  2  6 but there was certain of the scribe sit there  and reason in their heart  2  7 whi doth this man thus speak blasphemi  who can forgiv sin but god onli  2  8 and immedi when jesus perceiv in his spirit that they so reason within themselv  he said unto them  whi reason ye these thing in your heart  2  9 whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsi  thi sin be forgiven thee  or to say  aris  and take up thi bed  and walk  2  10 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin   he saith to the sick of the palsi  2  11 i say unto thee  aris  and take up thi bed  and go thi way into thine hous  2  12 and immedi he aros  took up the bed  and went forth befor them all  insomuch that they were all amaz  and glorifi god  say  we never saw it on this fashion  2  13 and he went forth again by the sea side  and all the multitud resort unto him  and he taught them  2  14 and as he pass by  he saw levi the son of alphaeus sit at the receipt of custom  and said unto him  follow me  and he aros and follow him  2  15 and it came to pass  that  as jesus sat at meat in his hous  mani publican and sinner sat also togeth with jesus and his discipl  for there were mani  and they follow him  2  16 and when the scribe and pharise saw him eat with publican and sinner  they said unto his discipl  how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publican and sinner  2  17 when jesus heard it  he saith unto them  they that are whole have no need of the physician  but they that are sick  i came not to call the righteous  but sinner to repent  2  18 and the discipl of john and of the pharise use to fast  and they come and say unto him  whi do the discipl of john and of the pharise fast  but thi discipl fast not  2  19 and jesus said unto them  can the children of the bridechamb fast  while the bridegroom is with them  as long as they have the bridegroom with them  they cannot fast  2  20 but the day will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them  and then shall they fast in those day  2  21 no man also seweth a piec of new cloth on an old garment  els the new piec that fill it up taketh away from the old  and the rent is made wors  2  22 and no man putteth new wine into old bottl  els the new wine doth burst the bottl  and the wine is spill  and the bottl will be mar  but new wine must be put into new bottl  2  23 and it came to pass  that he went through the corn field on the sabbath day  and his discipl began  as they went  to pluck the ear of corn  2  24 and the pharise said unto him  behold  whi do they on the sabbath day that which is not law  2  25 and he said unto them  have ye never read what david did  when he had need  and was an hungr  he  and they that were with him  2  26 how he went into the hous of god in the day of abiathar the high priest  and did eat the shewbread  which is not law to eat but for the priest  and gave also to them which were with him  2  27 and he said unto them  the sabbath was made for man  and not man for the sabbath  2  28 therefor the son of man is lord also of the sabbath  3  1 and he enter again into the synagogu  and there was a man there which had a wither hand  3  2 and they watch him  whether he would heal him on the sabbath day  that they might accus him  3  3 and he saith unto the man which had the wither hand  stand forth  3  4 and he saith unto them  is it law to do good on the sabbath day  or to do evil  to save life  or to kill  but they held their peac  3  5 and when he had look round about on them with anger  be griev for the hard of their heart  he saith unto the man  stretch forth thine hand  and he stretch it out  and his hand was restor whole as the other  3  6 and the pharise went forth  and straightway took counsel with the herodian against him  how they might destroy him  3  7 but jesus withdrew himself with his discipl to the sea  and a great multitud from galile follow him  and from judaea  3  8 and from jerusalem  and from idumaea  and from beyond jordan  and they about tyre and sidon  a great multitud  when they had heard what great thing he did  came unto him  3  9 and he spake to his discipl  that a small ship should wait on him becaus of the multitud  lest they should throng him  3  10 for he had heal mani  insomuch that they press upon him for to touch him  as mani as had plagu  3  11 and unclean spirit  when they saw him  fell down befor him  and cri  say  thou art the son of god  3  12 and he strait charg them that they should not make him known  3  13 and he goeth up into a mountain  and calleth unto him whom he would  and they came unto him  3  14 and he ordain twelv  that they should be with him  and that he might send them forth to preach  3  15 and to have power to heal sick  and to cast out devil  3  16 and simon he surnam peter  3  17 and jame the son of zebede  and john the brother of jame  and he surnam them boanerg  which is  the son of thunder  3  18 and andrew  and philip  and bartholomew  and matthew  and thoma  and jame the son of alphaeus  and thaddaeus  and simon the canaanit  3  19 and juda iscariot  which also betray him  and they went into an hous  3  20 and the multitud cometh togeth again  so that they could not so much as eat bread  3  21 and when his friend heard of it  they went out to lay hold on him  for they said  he is besid himself  3  22 and the scribe which came down from jerusalem said  he hath beelzebub  and by the princ of the devil casteth he out devil  3  23 and he call them unto him  and said unto them in parabl  how can satan cast out satan  3  24 and if a kingdom be divid against itself  that kingdom cannot stand  3  25 and if a hous be divid against itself  that hous cannot stand  3  26 and if satan rise up against himself  and be divid  he cannot stand  but hath an end  3  27 no man can enter into a strong man  s hous  and spoil his good  except he will first bind the strong man  and then he will spoil his hous  3  28 verili i say unto you  all sin shall be forgiven unto the son of men  and blasphemi wherewith soever they shall blasphem  3  29 but he that shall blasphem against the holi ghost hath never forgiv  but is in danger of etern damnat  3  30 becaus they said  he hath an unclean spirit  3  31 there came then his brethren and his mother  and  stand without  sent unto him  call him  3  32 and the multitud sat about him  and they said unto him  behold  thi mother and thi brethren without seek for thee  3  33 and he answer them  say  who is my mother  or my brethren  3  34 and he look round about on them which sat about him  and said  behold my mother and my brethren  3  35 for whosoev shall do the will of god  the same is my brother  and my sister  and mother  4  1 and he began again to teach by the sea side  and there was gather unto him a great multitud  so that he enter into a ship  and sat in the sea  and the whole multitud was by the sea on the land  4  2 and he taught them mani thing by parabl  and said unto them in his doctrin  4  3 hearken  behold  there went out a sower to sow  4  4 and it came to pass  as he sow  some fell by the way side  and the fowl of the air came and devour it up  4  5 and some fell on stoni ground  where it had not much earth  and immedi it sprang up  becaus it had no depth of earth  4  6 but when the sun was up  it was scorch  and becaus it had no root  it wither away  4  7 and some fell among thorn  and the thorn grew up  and choke it  and it yield no fruit  4  8 and other fell on good ground  and did yield fruit that sprang up and increas  and brought forth  some thirti  and some sixti  and some an hundr  4  9 and he said unto them  he that hath ear to hear  let him hear  4  10 and when he was alon  they that were about him with the twelv ask of him the parabl  4  11 and he said unto them  unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the kingdom of god  but unto them that are without  all these thing are done in parabl  4  12 that see they may see  and not perceiv  and hear they may hear  and not understand  lest at ani time they should be convert  and their sin should be forgiven them  4  13 and he said unto them  know ye not this parabl  and how then will ye know all parabl  4  14 the sower soweth the word  4  15 and these are they by the way side  where the word is sown  but when they have heard  satan cometh immedi  and taketh away the word that was sown in their heart  4  16 and these are they likewis which are sown on stoni ground  who  when they have heard the word  immedi receiv it with glad  4  17 and have no root in themselv  and so endur but for a time  afterward  when afflict or persecut ariseth for the word  s sake  immedi they are offend  4  18 and these are they which are sown among thorn  such as hear the word  4  19 and the care of this world  and the deceit of rich  and the lust of other thing enter in  choke the word  and it becometh unfruit  4  20 and these are they which are sown on good ground  such as hear the word  and receiv it  and bring forth fruit  some thirtyfold  some sixti  and some an hundr  4  21 and he said unto them  is a candl brought to be put under a bushel  or under a bed  and not to be set on a candlestick  4  22 for there is noth hid  which shall not be manifest  neither was ani thing kept secret  but that it should come abroad  4  23 if ani man have ear to hear  let him hear  4  24 and he said unto them  take heed what ye hear  with what measur ye mete  it shall be measur to you  and unto you that hear shall more be given  4  25 for he that hath  to him shall be given  and he that hath not  from him shall be taken even that which he hath  4  26 and he said  so is the kingdom of god  as if a man should cast seed into the ground  4  27 and should sleep  and rise night and day  and the seed should spring and grow up  he knoweth not how  4  28 for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself  first the blade  then the ear  after that the full corn in the ear  4  29 but when the fruit is brought forth  immedi he putteth in the sickl  becaus the harvest is come  4  30 and he said  whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god  or with what comparison shall we compar it  4  31 it is like a grain of mustard seed  which  when it is sown in the earth  is less than all the seed that be in the earth  4  32 but when it is sown  it groweth up  and becometh greater than all herb  and shooteth out great branch  so that the fowl of the air may lodg under the shadow of it  4  33 and with mani such parabl spake he the word unto them  as they were abl to hear it  4  34 but without a parabl spake he not unto them  and when they were alon  he expound all thing to his discipl  4  35 and the same day  when the even was come  he saith unto them  let us pass over unto the other side  4  36 and when they had sent away the multitud  they took him even as he was in the ship  and there were also with him other littl ship  4  37 and there aros a great storm of wind  and the wave beat into the ship  so that it was now full  4  38 and he was in the hinder part of the ship  asleep on a pillow  and they awak him  and say unto him  master  carest thou not that we perish  4  39 and he aros  and rebuk the wind  and said unto the sea  peac  be still  and the wind ceas  and there was a great calm  4  40 and he said unto them  whi are ye so fear  how is it that ye have no faith  4  41 and they fear exceed  and said one to anoth  what manner of man is this  that even the wind and the sea obey him  5  1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea  into the countri of the gadaren  5  2 and when he was come out of the ship  immedi there met him out of the tomb a man with an unclean spirit  5  3 who had his dwell among the tomb  and no man could bind him  no  not with chain  5  4 becaus that he had been often bound with fetter and chain  and the chain had been pluck asund by him  and the fetter broken in piec  neither could ani man tame him  5  5 and alway  night and day  he was in the mountain  and in the tomb  cri  and cut himself with stone  5  6 but when he saw jesus afar off  he ran and worship him  5  7 and cri with a loud voic  and said  what have i to do with thee  jesus  thou son of the most high god  i adjur thee by god  that thou torment me not  5  8 for he said unto him  come out of the man  thou unclean spirit  5  9 and he ask him  what is thi name  and he answer  say  my name is legion  for we are mani  5  10 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the countri  5  11 now there was there nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine feed  5  12 and all the devil besought him  say  send us into the swine  that we may enter into them  5  13 and forthwith jesus gave them leav  and the unclean spirit went out  and enter into the swine  and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the sea   they were about two thousand  and were choke in the sea  5  14 and they that fed the swine fled  and told it in the citi  and in the countri  and they went out to see what it was that was done  5  15 and they come to jesus  and see him that was possess with the devil  and had the legion  sit  and cloth  and in his right mind  and they were afraid  5  16 and they that saw it told them how it befel to him that was possess with the devil  and also concern the swine  5  17 and they began to pray him to depart out of their coast  5  18 and when he was come into the ship  he that had been possess with the devil pray him that he might be with him  5  19 howbeit jesus suffer him not  but saith unto him  go home to thi friend  and tell them how great thing the lord hath done for thee  and hath had compass on thee  5  20 and he depart  and began to publish in decapoli how great thing jesus had done for him  and all men did marvel  5  21 and when jesus was pass over again by ship unto the other side  much peopl gather unto him  and he was nigh unto the sea  5  22 and  behold  there cometh one of the ruler of the synagogu  jairus by name  and when he saw him  he fell at his feet  5  23 and besought him great  say  my littl daughter lieth at the point of death  i pray thee  come and lay thi hand on her  that she may be heal  and she shall live  5  24 and jesus went with him  and much peopl follow him  and throng him  5  25 and a certain woman  which had an issu of blood twelv year  5  26 and had suffer mani thing of mani physician  and had spent all that she had  and was noth better  but rather grew wors  5  27 when she had heard of jesus  came in the press behind  and touch his garment  5  28 for she said  if i may touch but his cloth  i shall be whole  5  29 and straightway the fountain of her blood was dri up  and she felt in her bodi that she was heal of that plagu  5  30 and jesus  immedi know in himself that virtu had gone out of him  turn him about in the press  and said  who touch my cloth  5  31 and his discipl said unto him  thou seest the multitud throng thee  and sayest thou  who touch me  5  32 and he look round about to see her that had done this thing  5  33 but the woman fear and trembl  know what was done in her  came and fell down befor him  and told him all the truth  5  34 and he said unto her  daughter  thi faith hath made thee whole  go in peac  and be whole of thi plagu  5  35 while he yet spake  there came from the ruler of the synagogu  s hous certain which said  thi daughter is dead  whi troublest thou the master ani further  5  36 as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken  he saith unto the ruler of the synagogu  be not afraid  onli believ  5  37 and he suffer no man to follow him  save peter  and jame  and john the brother of jame  5  38 and he cometh to the hous of the ruler of the synagogu  and seeth the tumult  and them that wept and wail great  5  39 and when he was come in  he saith unto them  whi make ye this ado  and weep  the damsel is not dead  but sleepeth  5  40 and they laugh him to scorn  but when he had put them all out  he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel  and them that were with him  and entereth in where the damsel was lie  5  41 and he took the damsel by the hand  and said unto her  talitha cumi  which is  be interpret  damsel  i say unto thee  aris  5  42 and straightway the damsel aros  and walk  for she was of the age of twelv year  and they were astonish with a great astonish  5  43 and he charg them strait that no man should know it  and command that someth should be given her to eat  6  1 and he went out from thenc  and came into his own countri  and his discipl follow him  6  2 and when the sabbath day was come  he began to teach in the synagogu  and mani hear him were astonish  say  from whenc hath this man these thing  and what wisdom is this which is given unto him  that even such mighti work are wrought by his hand  6  3 is not this the carpent  the son of mari  the brother of jame  and jose  and of juda  and simon  and are not his sister here with us  and they were offend at him  6  4 but jesus  said unto them  a prophet is not without honour  but in his own countri  and among his own kin  and in his own hous  6  5 and he could there do no mighti work  save that he laid his hand upon a few

for their sake which sat with him  he would not reject her  6  27 and immedi the king sent an execution  and command his head to be brought  and he went and behead him in the prison  6  28 and brought his head in a charger  and gave it to the damsel  and the damsel gave it to her mother  6  29 and when his discipl heard of it  they came and took up his corps  and laid it in a tomb  6  30 and the apostl gather themselv togeth unto jesus  and told him all thing  both what they had done  and what they had taught  6  31 and he said unto them  come ye yourselv apart into a desert place  and rest a while  for there were mani come and go  and they had no leisur so much as to eat  6  32 and they depart into a desert place by ship privat  6  33 and the peopl saw them depart  and mani knew him  and ran afoot thither out of all citi  and outwent them  and came togeth unto him  6  34 and jesus  when he came out  saw much peopl  and was move with compass toward them  becaus they were as sheep not

and he command them to make all sit down by compani upon the green grass  6  40 and they sat down in rank  by hundr  and by fifti  6  41 and when he had taken the five loav and the two fish  he look up to heaven  and bless  and brake the loav  and gave them to his discipl to set befor them  and the two fish divid he among them all  6  42 and they did all eat  and were fill  6  43 and they took up twelv basket full of the fragment  and of the fish  6  44 and they that did eat of the loav were about five thousand men  6  45 and straightway he constrain his discipl to get into the ship  and to go to the other side befor unto bethsaida  while he sent away the peopl  6  46 and when he had sent them away  he depart into a mountain to pray  6  47 and when even was come  the ship was in the midst of the sea  and he alon on the land  6  48 and he saw them toil in row  for the wind was contrari unto them  and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them  walk upon the sea  and would have pass by them  6  49 but when they saw him walk upon the sea  they suppos it had been a spirit  and cri out  6  50 for they all saw him  and were troubl  and immedi he talk with them  and saith unto them  be of good cheer  it is i  be not afraid  6  51 and he went up unto them into the ship  and the wind ceas  and they were sore amaz in themselv beyond measur  and wonder  6  52 for they consid not the miracl of the loav  for their heart was harden  6  53 and when they had pass over  they came into the land of gennesaret  and drew to the shore  6  54 and when they were come out of the ship  straightway they knew him  6  55 and ran through that whole region round about  and began to carri about in bed those that were sick  where they heard he was  6  56 and whithersoev he enter  into villag  or citi  or countri  they laid the sick in the street  and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment  and as mani as touch him were made whole  7  1 then came togeth unto him the pharise  and certain of the scribe  which came from jerusalem  7  2 and when they saw some of his discipl eat bread with defil  that is to say  with unwashen  hand  they found fault  7  3 for the pharise  and all the jew  except they wash their hand oft  eat not  hold the tradit of the elder  7  4 and when they come from the market  except they wash  they eat not  and mani other thing there be  which they have receiv to hold  as the wash of cup  and pot  brasen vessel  and of tabl  7  5 then the pharise and scribe ask him  whi walk not thi discipl accord to the tradit of the elder  but eat bread with unwashen hand  7  6 he answer and said unto them  well hath esaia prophesi of you hypocrit  as it is written  this peopl honoureth me with their lip  but their heart is far from me  7  7 howbeit in vain do they worship me  teach for doctrin the command of men  7  8 for lay asid the command of god  ye hold the tradit of men  as the wash of pot and cup  and mani other such like thing ye do  7  9 and he said unto them  full well ye reject the command of god  that ye may keep your own tradit  7  10 for mose said  honour thi father and thi mother  and  whoso curseth father or mother  let him die the death  7  11 but ye say  if a man shall say to his father or mother  it is corban  that is to say  a gift  by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me  he shall

 14 and when he had call all the peopl unto him  he said unto them  hearken unto me everi one of you  and understand  7  15 there is noth from without a man  that enter into him can defil him  but the thing which come out of him  those are they that defil the man  7  16 if ani man have ear to hear  let him hear  7  17 and when he was enter into the hous from the peopl  his discipl ask him concern the parabl  7  18 and he saith unto them  are ye so without understand also  do ye not perceiv  that whatsoev thing from without entereth into the man  it cannot defil him  7  19 becaus it entereth not into his heart  but into the belli  and goeth out into the draught  purg all meat  7  20 and he said  that which cometh out of the man  that defileth the man  7  21 for from within  out of the heart of men  proceed evil thought  adulteri  fornic  murder  7  22 theft  covet  wicked  deceit  lascivi  an evil eye  blasphemi  pride  foolish  7  23 all these evil thing come from within  and

whose young daughter had an unclean spirit  heard of him  and came and fell at his feet  7  26 the woman was a greek  a syrophenician by nation  and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter  7  27 but jesus said unto her  let the children first be fill  for it is not meet to take the children  s bread  and to cast it unto the dog  7  28 and she answer and said unto

hous  she found the devil gone out  and her daughter laid upon the bed  7  31 and again  depart from the coast of tyre and sidon  he came unto the sea of galile  through the midst of the coast of decapoli  7  32 and they bring unto him one that was deaf  and had an impedi in his speech  and they beseech him to put his hand upon him  7  33 and he took him asid from the multitud  and put his finger into his ear  and he spit  and touch his tongu  7  34 and look up to heaven  he sigh  and saith unto him  ephphatha  that is  be open  7  35 and straightway his ear were open  and the string of his tongu was loos  and he spake plain  7  36 and he charg them that they should tell no man  but the more he charg them  so much the more a great deal they publish it  7  37 and were beyond measur astonish  say  he hath done all thing well  he maketh both the deaf to hear  and the dumb to speak  8  1 in those day the multitud be veri great  and have noth to eat  jesus call his discipl unto him  and saith unto them  8  2 i have compass on the multitud  becaus they have now been with me three day  and have noth to eat  8  3 and if i send them away fast to their own hous  they will faint by the way  for diver of them came from far  8  4 and his discipl answer him  from whenc can a man satisfi these men with bread here in the wilder  8  5 and he ask them  how mani loav have ye  and they said  seven  8  6 and he command the peopl to sit down on the ground  and he took the seven loav  and gave thank  and brake  and gave to his discipl to set befor them  and they did set them befor the peopl  8  7 and they had a few small fish  and he bless  and command to set them also befor them  8  8 so they did eat  and were fill  and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven basket  8  9 and they that had eaten were about four thousand  and he sent them away  8  10 and straightway he enter into a ship with his discipl  and came into the part of dalmanutha  8  11 and the pharise came forth  and began to question with him  seek of him a sign from heaven  tempt him  8  12 and he sigh deepli in his spirit  and saith  whi doth this generat seek after a sign  verili i say unto you  there shall no sign be given unto this generat  8  13 and he left them  and enter into the ship again depart to the other side  8  14 now the discipl had forgotten to take bread  neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf  8  15 and he charg them  say  take heed  bewar of the leaven of the pharise  and of the leaven of herod  8  16 and they reason among themselv  say  it is becaus we have no bread  8  17 and when jesus knew it  he saith unto them  whi reason ye  becaus ye have no bread  perceiv ye not yet  neither understand  have ye your heart yet harden  8  18 have eye  see ye not  and have ear  hear ye not  and do ye not rememb  8  19 when i brake the five loav among five thousand  how mani basket full of fragment took ye up  they say unto him  twelv  8  20 and when the seven among four thousand  how mani basket full of fragment took ye up  and they said  seven  8  21 and he said unto them  how is it that ye do not understand  8  22 and he cometh to bethsaida  and they bring a blind man unto him  and besought him to touch him  8  23 and he took the blind man by the hand  and led him out of the town  and when he had spit on his eye  and put his hand upon him  he ask him if he saw ought  8  24 and he look up  and said  i see men as tree  walk  8  25 after that he put his hand again upon his eye  and made him look up  and he was restor  and saw everi man clear  8  26 and he sent him away to his hous  say  neither go into the town  nor tell it to ani in the town  8  27 and jesus went out  and his discipl  into the town of caesarea philippi  and by the way he ask his discipl  say unto them  whom do men say that i am  8  28 and they answer  john the baptist  but some say  elia  and other  one of the prophet  8  29 and he saith unto them  but whom say ye that i am  and peter answereth and saith unto him  thou art the christ  8  30 and he charg them that they should tell no man of him  8  31 and he began to teach them  that the son of man must suffer mani thing  and be reject of the elder  and of the chief priest  and scribe  and be kill  and after three day rise again  8  32 and he spake that say open  and peter took him  and began to rebuk him  8  33 but when he had turn about and look on his discipl  he rebuk peter  say  get thee behind me  satan  for thou savourest not the thing that be of god  but the thing that be of men  8  34 and when he had call the peopl unto him with his discipl also  he said unto them  whosoev will come after me  let him deni himself  and take up his cross  and follow me  8  35 for whosoev will save his life shall lose it  but whosoev shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel  s  the same shall save it  8  36 for what shall it profit a man  if he shall gain the whole world  and lose his own soul  8  37 or what shall a man give in exchang for his soul  8  38 whosoev therefor shall be asham of me and of my word in this adulter and sin generat  of him also shall the son of man be asham  when he cometh in the glori of his father with the holi angel  9  1 and he said unto them  verili i say unto you  that there be some of them that stand here  which shall not tast of death  till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power  9  2 and after six day jesus taketh with him peter  and jame  and john  and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselv  and he was transfigur befor them  9  3 and his raiment becam shine  exceed white as snow  so as no fuller on earth can white them  9  4 and there appear unto them elia with mose  and they were talk with jesus  9  5 and peter answer and said to jesus  master  it is good for us to be here  and let us make three tabernacl  one for thee  and one for mose  and one for elia  9  6 for he wist not what to say  for they were sore afraid  9  7 and there was a cloud that overshadow them  and a voic came out of the cloud  say  this is my belov son  hear him  9  8 and sudden  when they had look round about  they saw no man ani more  save jesus onli with themselv  9  9 and as they came down from the mountain  he charg them that they should tell no man what thing they had seen  till the son of man were risen from the dead  9  10 and they kept that say with themselv  question one with anoth what the rise from the dead should mean  9  11 and they ask him  say  whi say the scribe that elia must first come  9  12 and he answer and told them  elia verili cometh first  and restoreth all thing  and how it is written of the son of man  that he must suffer mani thing  and be set at nought  9  13 but i say unto you  that elia is inde come  and they have done unto him whatsoev they list  as it is written of him  9  14 and when he came to his discipl  he saw a great multitud about them  and the scribe question with them  9  15 and straightway all the peopl  when they beheld him  were great amaz  and run to him salut him  9  16 and he ask the scribe  what question ye with them  9  17 and one of the multitud answer and said  master  i have brought unto thee my son  which hath a dumb spirit  9  18 and wheresoev he taketh him  he teareth him  and he foameth  and gnasheth with his teeth  and pineth away  and i spake to thi discipl that they should cast him out  and they could not  9  19 he answereth him  and saith  o faithless generat  how long shall i be with you  how long shall i suffer you  bring him unto me  9  20 and they brought him unto him  and when he saw him  straightway the spirit tare him  and he fell on the ground  and wallow foam  9  21 and he ask his father  how long is it ago sinc this came unto him  and he said  of a child  9  22 and ofttim it hath cast him into the fire  and into the water  to destroy him  but if thou canst do ani thing  have compass on us  and help us  9  23 jesus said unto him  if thou canst believ  all thing are possibl to him that believeth  9  24 and straightway the father of the child cri out  and said with tear  lord  i believ  help thou mine unbelief  9  25 when jesus saw that the peopl came run togeth  he rebuk the foul spirit  say unto him  thou dumb and deaf spirit  i charg thee  come out of him  and enter no more into him  9  26 and the spirit cri  and rent him sore  and came out of him  and he was as one dead  insomuch that mani said  he is dead  9  27 but jesus took him by the hand  and lift him up  and he aros  9  28 and when he was come into the hous  his discipl ask him privat  whi could not we cast him out  9  29 and he said unto them  this kind can come forth by noth  but by prayer and fast  9  30 and they depart thenc  and pass through galile  and he would not that ani man should know it  9  31 for he taught his discipl  and said unto them  the son of man is deliv into the hand of men  and they shall kill him  and after that he is kill  he shall rise the third day  9  32 but they understood not that say  and were afraid to ask him  9  33 and he came to capernaum  and be in the hous he ask them  what was it that ye disput among yourselv by the way  9  34 but they held their peac  for by the way they had disput among themselv  who should be the greatest  9  35 and he sat down  and call the twelv  and saith unto them  if ani man desir to be first  the same shall be last of all  and servant of all  9  36 and he took a child  and set him in the midst of them  and when he had taken him in his arm  he said unto them  9  37 whosoev shall receiv one of such children in my name  receiveth me  and whosoev shall receiv me  receiveth not me  but him that sent me  9  38 and john answer him  say  master  we saw one cast out devil in thi name  and he followeth not us  and we forbad him  becaus he followeth not us  9  39 but jesus said  forbid him not  for there is no man which shall do a miracl in my name  that can light speak evil of me  9  40 for he that is not against us is on our part  9  41 for whosoev shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name  becaus ye belong to christ  verili i say unto you  he shall not lose his reward  9  42 and whosoev shall offend one of these littl one that believ in me  it is better for him that a millston were hang about his neck  and he were cast into the sea  9  43 and if thi hand offend thee  cut it off  it is better for thee to enter into life maim  than have two hand to go into hell  into the fire that never shall be quench  9  44 where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quench  9  45 and if thi foot offend thee  cut it off  it is better for thee to enter halt into life  than have two feet to be cast into hell  into the fire that never shall be quench  9  46 where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quench  9  47 and if thine eye offend thee  pluck it out  it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye  than have two eye to be cast into hell fire  9  48 where their worm dieth not  and the fire is not quench  9  49 for everi one shall be salt with fire  and everi sacrific shall be salt with salt  9  50 salt is good  but if the salt have lost his salt  wherewith will ye season it  have salt in yourselv  and have peac one with anoth  10  1 and he aros from thenc  and cometh into the coast of judaea by the farther side of jordan  and the peopl resort unto him again  and  as he was wont  he taught them again  10  2 and the pharise came to him  and ask him  is it law for a man to put away his wife  tempt him  10  3 and he answer and said unto them  what did mose command you  10  4 and they said  mose suffer to write a bill of divorc  and to put her away  10  5 and jesus answer and said unto them  for the hard of your heart he wrote you this precept  10  6 but from the begin of the creation god made them male and femal  10  7 for this caus shall a man leav his father and mother  and cleav to his wife  10  8 and they twain shall be one flesh  so then they are no more twain  but one flesh  10  9 what therefor god hath join togeth  let not man put asund  10  10 and in the hous his discipl ask him again of the same matter  10  11 and he saith unto them  whosoev shall put away his wife  and marri anoth  committeth adulteri against her  10  12 and if a woman shall put away her husband  and be marri to anoth  she committeth adulteri  10  13 and they brought young children to him  that he should touch them  and his discipl rebuk those that brought them  10  14 but when jesus saw it  he was much displeas  and said unto them  suffer the littl children to come unto me  and forbid them not  for of such is the kingdom of god  10  15 verili i say unto you  whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom of god as a littl child  he shall not enter therein  10  16 and he took them up in his arm  put his hand upon them  and bless them  10  17 and when he was gone forth into the way  there came one run  and kneel to him  and ask him  good master  what shall i do that i may inherit etern life  10  18 and jesus said unto him  whi callest thou me good  there is none good but one  that is  god  10  19 thou knowest the command  do not commit adulteri  do not kill  do not steal  do not bear fals wit  defraud not  honour thi father and mother  10  20 and he answer and said unto him  master  all these have i observ from my youth  10  21 then jesus behold him love him  and said unto him  one thing thou lackest  go thi way  sell whatsoev thou hast  and give to the poor  and thou shalt have treasur in heaven  and come  take up the cross  and follow me  10  22 and he was sad at that say  and went away griev  for he had great possess  10  23 and jesus look round about  and saith unto his discipl  how hard shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god  10  24 and the discipl were astonish at his word  but jesus answereth again  and saith unto them  children  how hard is it for them that trust in rich to enter into the kingdom of god  10  25 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needl  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  10  26 and they were astonish out of measur  say among themselv  who then can be save  10  27 and jesus look upon them saith  with men it is imposs  but not with god  for with god all thing are possibl  10  28 then peter began to say unto him  lo  we have left all  and have follow thee  10  29 and jesus answer and said  verili i say unto you  there is no man that hath left hous  or brethren  or sister  or father  or mother  or wife  or children  or land  for my sake  and the gospel  s  10  30 but he shall receiv an hundredfold now in this time  hous  and brethren  and sister  and mother  and children  and land  with persecut  and in the world to come etern life  10  31 but mani that are first shall be last  and the last first  10  32 and they were in the way go up to jerusalem  and jesus went befor them  and they were amaz  and as they follow  they were afraid  and he took again the twelv  and began to tell them what thing should happen unto him  10  33 say  behold  we go up to jerusalem  and the son of man shall be deliv unto the chief priest  and unto the scribe  and they shall condemn him to death  and shall deliv him to the gentil  10  34 and they shall mock him  and shall scourg him  and shall spit upon him  and shall kill him  and the third day he shall rise again  10  35 and jame and john  the son of zebede  come unto him  say  master  we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoev we shall desir  10  36 and he said unto them  what would ye that i should do for you  10  37 they said unto him  grant unto us that we may sit  one on thi right hand  and the other on thi left hand  in thi glori  10  38 but jesus said unto them  ye know not what ye ask  can ye drink of the cup that i drink of  and be baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with  10  39 and they said unto him  we can  and jesus said unto them  ye shall inde drink of the cup that i drink of  and with the baptism that i am baptiz withal shall ye be baptiz  10  40 but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give  but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepar  10  41 and when the ten heard it  they began to be much displeas with jame and john  10  42 but jesus call them to him  and saith unto them  ye know that they which are account to rule over the gentil exercis lordship over them  and their great one exercis author upon them  10  43 but so shall it not be among you  but whosoev will be great among you  shall be your minist  10  44 and whosoev of you will be the chiefest  shall be servant of all  10  45 for even the son of man came not to be minist unto  but to minist  and to give his life a ransom for mani  10  46 and they came to jericho  and as he went out of jericho with his discipl and a great number of peopl  blind bartimaeus  the son of timaeus  sat by the highway side beg  10  47 and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth  he began to cri out  and say  jesus  thou son of david  have merci on me  10  48 and mani charg him that he should hold his peac  but he cri the more a great deal  thou son of david  have merci on me  10  49 and jesus stood still  and command him to be call  and they call the blind man  say unto him  be of good comfort  rise  he

that i might receiv my sight  10  52 and jesus said unto him  go thi way  thi faith hath made thee whole  and immedi he receiv his sight  and follow jesus in the way  11  1 and when they came nigh to jerusalem  unto bethphag and bethani  at the mount of oliv  he sendeth forth two of his discipl  11  2 and saith unto them  go your way into the villag over against you  and as soon as ye be enter into it  ye shall find a colt tie  whereon never man sat  loos him  and bring him  11  3 and if ani man say unto you  whi do ye this  say ye that the lord hath need of him  and straightway he will

what do ye  loos the colt  11  6 and they said unto them even as jesus had command  and they let them go  11  7 and they brought the colt to jesus  and cast their garment on him  and he sat upon him  11  8 and mani spread their garment in the way  and other cut down branch off the tree  and straw them in the way  11  9 and they that went befor  and they that follow  cri  say  hosanna  bless is he

templ  and when he had look round about upon all thing  and now the eventid was come  he went out unto bethani with the twelv  11  12 and on the morrow  when they were come from bethani  he was hungri  11  13 and see a fig tree afar off have leav  he came  if hapli he might find ani thing thereon  and when he came to it  he found noth but leav  for the time of fig was not yet  11  14 and jesus answer and said unto it  no man eat fruit of thee hereaft for ever  and his discipl heard it  11  15 and they come to jerusalem  and jesus went into the templ  and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the templ  and overthrew the tabl of the moneychang  and the seat of them that sold dove  11  16 and would not suffer that ani man should carri ani vessel through the templ  11  17 and he taught  say unto them  is it not written  my hous shall be call of all nation the hous of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thiev  11  18 and the scribe and chief priest heard it  and sought how they might destroy him  for they fear him  becaus all the peopl was astonish at his doctrin  11  19 and when even was come  he went out of the citi  11  20 and in the morn  as they pass by  they saw

did ye not believ him  11  32 but if we shall say  of men  they fear the peopl  for all men count john  that he was a prophet inde  11  33 and they answer and said unto jesus  we cannot tell  and jesus answer saith unto them  neither do i tell you by what author i do these thing  12  1 and he began to speak unto them by parabl  a certain man plant a vineyard  and set an hedg about it  and dig a place for the winefat  and built a tower  and let it out to husbandmen  and went into a far countri  12  2 and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant  that he might receiv from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard  12  3 and they caught him  and beat him  and sent him away empti  12  4 and again he sent unto them anoth servant  and at him they cast stone  and wound him in the head  and sent him away shame handl  12  5 and again he sent anoth  and him they kill  and mani other  beat some  and kill some  12  6 have yet therefor one son  his wellbelov  he sent him also last unto them  say  they will rever my son  12  7 but those husbandmen said among themselv  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  and the inherit shall be our  s  12  8 and they took him  and kill him  and cast him out of the vineyard  12  9 what shall therefor the lord of the vineyard do  he will come and destroy the husbandmen  and will give the vineyard unto other  12  10 and have ye not read this scriptur  the stone which the builder reject is becom the head of the corner  12  11 this was the lord  s do  and it is marvel in our eye  12  12 and they sought to lay hold on him  but fear the peopl  for they knew that he had spoken the parabl against them  and they left him  and went their way  12  13 and they send unto him certain of the pharise and of the herodian  to catch him in his word  12  14 and when they were come  they say unto him  master  we know that thou art true  and carest for no man  for thou regardest not the person of men  but teachest the way of god in truth  is it law to give tribut to caesar  or not  12  15 shall we give  or shall we not give  but he  know their hypocrisi  said unto them  whi tempt ye me  bring me a penni  that i may see it  12  16 and they brought it  and he saith unto them  whose is this imag and superscript  and they said unto him  caesar  s  12  17 and jesus answer said unto them  render to caesar the thing that are caesar  s  and to god the thing that are god  s  and they marvel at him  12  18 then come unto him the sadduce  which say there is no resurrect  and they ask him  say  12  19 master  mose wrote unto us  if a man  s brother die  and leav his wife behind him  and leav no children  that his brother should take his wife  and rais up seed unto his brother  12  20 now there were seven brethren  and the first took a wife  and die left no seed  12  21 and the second took her  and die  neither left he ani seed  and the third likewis  12  22 and the seven had her  and left no seed  last of all the woman die also  12  23 in the resurrect therefor  when they shall rise  whose wife shall she be of them  for the seven had her to wife  12  24 and jesus answer said unto them  do ye not therefor err  becaus ye know not the scriptur  neither the power of god  12  25 for when they shall rise from the dead  they neither marri  nor are given in marriag  but are as the angel which are in heaven  12  26 and as touch the dead  that they rise  have ye not read in the book of mose  how in the bush god spake unto him  say  i am the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  12  27 he is not the god of the dead  but the god of the live  ye therefor do great err  12  28 and one of the scribe came  and have heard them reason togeth  and perceiv that he had answer them well  ask him  which is the first command of all  12  29 and jesus answer him  the first of all the command is  hear  o israel  the lord our god is one lord  12  30 and thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi heart  and with all thi soul  and with all thi mind  and with all thi strength  this is the first command  12  31 and the second is like  name this  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  there is none other command greater than these  12  32 and the scribe said unto him  well  master  thou hast said the truth  for there is one god  and there is none other but he  12  33 and to love him with all the heart  and with all the understand  and with all the soul  and with all the strength  and to love his neighbour as himself  is more than all whole burnt offer and sacrific  12  34 and when jesus saw that he answer discreet  he said unto him  thou art not far from the kingdom of god  and no man after that durst ask him ani question  12  35 and jesus answer and said  while he taught in the templ  how say the scribe that christ is the son of david  12  36 for david himself said by the holi ghost  the lord said to my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine enemi thi footstool  12  37 david therefor himself calleth him lord  and whenc is he then his son  and the common peopl heard him glad  12  38 and he said unto them in his doctrin  bewar of the scribe  which love to go in long cloth  and love salut in the marketplac  12  39 and the chief seat in the synagogu  and the uppermost room at feast  12  40 which devour widow  hous  and for a pretenc make long prayer  these shall receiv greater damnat  12  41 and jesus sat over against the treasuri  and beheld how the peopl cast money into the treasuri  and mani that were rich cast in much  12  42 and there came a certain poor widow  and she threw in two mite  which make a farth  12  43 and he call unto him his discipl  and saith unto them  verili i say unto you  that this poor widow hath cast more in  than all they which have cast into the treasuri  12  44 for all they did cast in of their abund  but she of her want did cast in all that she had  even all her live  13  1 and as he went out of the templ  one of his discipl saith unto him  master  see what manner of stone and what build are here  13  2 and jesus answer said unto him  seest thou these great build  there shall not be left one stone upon anoth  that shall not be thrown down  13  3 and as he sat upon the mount of oliv over against the templ  peter and jame and john and andrew ask him privat  13  4 tell us  when shall these thing be  and what shall be the sign when all these thing shall be fulfil  13  5 and jesus answer them began to say  take heed lest ani man deceiv you  13  6 for mani shall come in my name  say  i am christ  and shall deceiv mani  13  7 and when ye shall hear of war and rumour of war  be ye not troubl  for such thing must need be  but the end shall not be yet  13  8 for nation shall rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  and there shall be earthquak in diver place  and there shall be famin and troubl  these are the begin of sorrow  13  9 but take heed to yourselv  for they shall deliv you up to council  and in the synagogu ye shall be beaten  and ye shall be brought befor ruler and king for my sake  for a testimoni against them  13  10 and the gospel must first be publish among all nation  13  11 but when they shall lead you  and deliv you up  take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak  neither do ye premedit  but whatsoev shall be given you in that hour  that speak ye  for it is not ye that speak  but the holi ghost  13  12 now the brother shall betray the brother to death  and the father the son  and children shall rise up against their parent  and shall caus them to be put to death  13  13 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name  s sake  but he that shall endur unto the end  the same shall be save  13  14 but when ye shall see the abomin of desol  spoken of by daniel the prophet  stand where it ought not   let him that readeth understand  then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountain  13  15 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the hous  neither enter therein  to take ani thing out of his hous  13  16 and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment  13  17 but woe to them that are with child  and to them that give suck in those day  13  18 and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter  13  19 for in those day shall be afflict  such as was not from the begin of the creation which god creat unto this time  neither shall be  13  20 and except that the lord had shorten those day  no flesh should be save  but for the elect  s sake  whom he hath chosen  he hath shorten the day  13  21 and then if ani man shall say to you  lo  here is christ  or  lo  he is there  believ him not  13  22 for fals christ and fals prophet shall rise  and shall shew sign and wonder  to seduc  if it were possibl  even the elect  13  23 but take ye heed  behold  i have foretold you all thing  13  24 but in those day  after that tribul  the sun shall be darken  and the moon shall not give her light  13  25 and the star of heaven shall fall  and the power that are in heaven shall be shaken  13  26 and then shall they see the son of man come in the cloud with great power and glori  13  27 and then shall he send his angel  and shall gather togeth his elect from the four wind  from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven  13  28 now learn a parabl of the fig tree  when her branch is yet tender  and putteth forth leav  ye know that summer is near  13  29 so ye in like manner  when ye shall see these thing come to pass  know that it is nigh  even at the door  13  30 verili i say unto you  that this generat shall not pass  till all these thing be done  13  31 heaven and earth shall pass away  but my word shall not pass away  13  32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man  no  not the angel which are in heaven  neither the son  but the father  13  33 take ye heed  watch and pray  for ye know not when the time is  13  34 for the son of man is as a man take a far journey  who left his hous  and gave author to his servant  and to everi man his work  and command the porter to watch  13  35 watch ye therefor  for ye know not when the master of the hous cometh  at even  or at midnight  or at the cockcrow  or in the morn  13  36 lest come sudden he find you sleep  13  37 and what i say unto you i say unto all  watch  14  1 after two day was the feast

and have been given to the poor  and they murmur against her  14  6 and jesus said  let her alon  whi troubl ye her  she hath wrought a good work on me  14  7 for ye have the poor with you alway  and whensoev ye will ye may do them good  but me ye have not alway  14  8 she hath done what she could  she is come aforehand to anoint my bodi to the buri  14  9 verili i say unto you  wheresoev this gospel shall be preach throughout the whole world  this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memori of her  14  10 and juda iscariot  one of the twelv  went unto the chief priest  to betray him unto them  14  11 and when they heard it  they were glad  and promis to give him money  and he sought how he might conveni betray him  14  12 and the first day of unleaven bread  when they kill the passov  his discipl said unto him  where wilt thou that we go and prepar that thou mayest eat the passov  14  13 and he sendeth forth two of his discipl  and saith unto them  go ye into the

22 and as they did eat  jesus took bread  and bless  and brake it  and gave to them  and said  take  eat  this is my bodi  14  23 and he took the cup  and when he had given thank  he gave it to them  and they all drank of it  14  24 and he said unto them  this is my blood of the new testament  which is shed for mani  14  25 verili i say unto you  i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine  until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god  14  26 and when they had sung an hymn  they went out into the mount of oliv  14  27 and jesus saith unto them  all ye shall be offend becaus

he was in a certain citi  behold a man full of leprosi  who see jesus fell on his face  and besought him  say  lord  if thou wilt  thou canst make me clean  5  13 and he put forth his hand  and touch him  say  i will  be thou clean  and immedi the leprosi depart from him  5  14 and he charg him to tell no man  but go  and shew thyself to the priest  and offer for thi cleans  accord as mose command  for a testimoni unto them  5  15 but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him  and great multitud came togeth to hear  and to be heal by him of their infirm  5  16 and he withdrew himself into the wilder  and pray  5  17 and it came to pass on a certain day  as he was teach  that there were pharise and doctor of the law sit by  which were come out of everi town of galile  and judaea  and jerusalem  and the power of the lord was present to heal them  5  18 and  behold  men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsi  and they sought mean to bring him in  and to lay him befor him  5  19 and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in becaus of the multitud  they went upon the housetop  and let him down through the tile with his couch into the midst befor jesus  5  20 and when he saw their faith  he said unto him  man  thi sin are forgiven thee  5  21 and the scribe and the pharise began to reason  say  who is this which speaketh blasphemi  who can forgiv sin  but god alon  5  22 but when jesus perceiv their thought  he answer said unto them  what reason ye in your heart  5  23 whether is easier  to say  thi sin be forgiven thee  or to say  rise up and walk  5  24 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgiv sin   he said unto the sick of the palsi  i say unto thee  aris  and take up thi couch  and go into thine hous  5  25 and immedi he rose up befor them  and took up that whereon he lay  and depart to his own hous  glorifi god  5  26 and they were all amaz  and they glorifi god  and were fill with fear  say  we have seen strang thing to day  5  27 and after these thing he went forth  and saw a publican  name levi  sit at the receipt of custom  and he said unto him  follow me  5  28 and he left all  rose up  and follow him  5  29 and levi made him a great feast in his own hous  and there was a great compani of publican and of other that sat down with them  5  30 but their scribe and pharise murmur against his discipl  say  whi do ye eat and drink with publican and sinner  5  31 and jesus answer said unto them  they that are whole need not a physician  but they that are sick  5  32 i came not to call the righteous  but sinner to repent  5  33 and they said unto him  whi do the discipl of john fast often  and make prayer  and likewis the discipl of the pharise  but thine eat and drink  5  34 and he said unto them  can ye make the children of the bridechamb fast  while the bridegroom is with them  5  35 but the day will come  when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them  and then shall they fast in those day  5  36 and he spake also a parabl unto them  no man putteth a piec of a new garment upon an old  if otherwis  then both the new maketh a rent  and the piec that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old  5  37 and no man putteth new wine into old bottl  els the new wine will burst the bottl  and be spill  and the bottl shall perish  5  38 but new wine must be put into new bottl  and both are preserv  5  39 no man also have drunk old wine straightway desireth new  for he saith  the old is better  6  1 and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first  that he went through the corn field  and his discipl pluck the ear of corn  and did eat  rub them in their hand  6  2 and certain of the pharise said unto them  whi do ye that which is not law to do on the sabbath day  6  3 and jesus answer them said  have ye not read so much as this  what david did  when himself was an hungr  and they which were with him  6  4 how he went into the hous of god  and did take and eat the shewbread  and gave also to them that were with him  which it is not law to eat but for the priest alon  6  5 and he said unto them  that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath  6  6 and it came to pass also on anoth sabbath  that he enter into the synagogu and taught  and there was a man whose right hand was wither  6  7 and the scribe and pharise watch him  whether he would heal on the sabbath day  that they might find an accus against him  6  8 but he knew their thought  and said to the man which had the wither hand  rise up  and stand forth in the midst  and he aros and stood forth  6  9 then said jesus unto them  i will ask you one thing  is it law on the sabbath day to do good  or to do evil  to save life  or to destroy it  6  10 and look round about upon them all  he said unto the man  stretch forth thi hand  and he did so  and his hand was restor whole as the other  6  11 and they were fill with mad  and commune one with anoth what they might do to jesus  6  12 and it came to pass in those day  that he went out into a mountain to pray  and continu all night in prayer to god  6  13 and when it was day  he call unto him his discipl  and of them he chose twelv  whom also he name apostl  6  14 simon   whom he also name peter  and andrew his brother  jame and john  philip and bartholomew  6  15 matthew and thoma  jame the son of alphaeus  and simon call zelot  6  16 and juda the brother of jame  and juda iscariot  which also was the traitor  6  17 and he came down with them  and stood in the plain  and the compani of his discipl  and a great multitud of peopl out of all judaea and jerusalem  and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon  which came to hear him  and to be heal of their diseas  6  18 and they that were vex with unclean spirit  and they were heal  6  19 and the whole multitud sought to touch him  for there went virtu out of him  and heal them all  6  20 and he lift up his eye on his discipl  and said  bless be ye poor  for your is the kingdom of god  6  21 bless are ye that hunger now  for ye shall be fill  bless are ye that weep now  for ye shall laugh  6  22 bless are ye  when men shall hate you  and when they shall separ you from their compani  and shall reproach you  and cast out your name as evil  for the son of man  s sake  6  23 rejoic ye in that day  and leap for joy  for  behold  your reward is great in heaven  for in the like manner did their father unto the prophet  6  24 but woe unto you that are rich  for ye have receiv your consol  6  25 woe unto you that are full  for ye shall hunger  woe unto you that laugh now  for ye shall mourn and weep  6  26 woe unto you  when all men shall speak well of you  for so did their father to the fals prophet  6  27 but i say unto you which hear  love your enemi  do good to them which hate you  6  28 bless them that curs you  and pray for them which despit use you  6  29 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other  and him that taketh away thi cloak forbid not to take thi coat also  6  30 give to everi man that asketh of thee  and of him that taketh away thi good ask them not again  6  31 and as ye would that men should do to you  do ye also to them likewis  6  32 for if ye love them which love you  what thank have ye  for sinner also love those that love them  6  33 and if ye do good to them which do good to you  what thank have ye  for sinner also do even the same  6  34 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiv  what thank have ye  for sinner also lend to sinner  to receiv as much again  6  35 but love ye your enemi  and do good  and lend  hope for noth again  and your reward shall be great  and ye shall be the children of the highest  for he is kind unto the unthank and to the evil  6  36 be ye therefor merci  as your father also is merci  6  37 judg not  and ye shall not be judg  condemn not  and ye shall not be condemn  forgiv  and ye shall be forgiven  6  38 give  and it shall be given unto you  good measur  press down  and shaken togeth  and run over  shall men give into your bosom  for with the same measur that ye mete withal it shall be measur to you again  6  39 and he spake a parabl unto them  can the blind lead the blind  shall they not both fall into the ditch  6  40 the discipl is not abov his master  but everi one that is perfect shall be as his master  6  41 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother  s eye  but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye  6  42 either how canst thou say to thi brother  brother  let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye  when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye  thou hypocrit  cast out first the beam out of thine own eye  and then shalt thou see clear to pull out the mote that is in thi brother  s eye  6  43 for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit  neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit  6  44 for everi tree is known by his own fruit  for of thorn men do not gather fig  nor of a brambl bush gather they grape  6  45 a good man out of the good treasur of his heart bringeth forth that which is good  and an evil man out of the evil treasur of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil  for of the abund of the heart his mouth speaketh  6  46 and whi call ye me  lord  lord  and do not the thing which i say  6  47 whosoev cometh to me  and heareth my say  and doeth them  i will shew you to whom he is like  6  48 he is like a man which built an hous  and dig deep  and laid the foundat on a rock  and when the flood aros  the stream beat vehement upon that hous  and could not shake it  for it was found upon a rock  6  49 but he that heareth  and doeth not  is like a man that without a foundat built an hous upon the earth  against which the stream did beat vehement  and immedi it fell  and the ruin of that hous was great  7  1 now when he had end all his say in the audienc of the peopl  he enter into capernaum  7  2 and a certain centurion  s servant  who was dear unto him  was sick  and readi to die  7  3 and when he heard of jesus  he sent unto him the elder of the jew  beseech him that he would come and heal his servant  7  4 and when they came to jesus  they besought him instant  say  that he was worthi for whom he should do this  7  5 for he loveth our nation  and he hath built us a synagogu  7  6 then jesus went with them  and when he was now not far from the hous  the centurion sent friend to him  say unto him  lord  troubl not thyself  for i am not worthi that thou shouldest enter under my roof  7  7 wherefor neither thought i myself worthi to come unto thee  but say in a word  and my servant shall be heal  7  8 for i also am a man set under author  have under me soldier  and i say unto one  go  and he goeth  and to anoth  come  and he cometh  and to my servant  do this  and he doeth it  7  9 when jesus heard these thing  he marvel at him  and turn him about  and said unto the peopl that follow him  i say unto you  i have not found so great faith  no  not in israel  7  10 and they that were sent  return to the hous  found the servant whole that had been sick  7  11 and it came to pass the day after  that he went into a citi call nain  and mani of his discipl went with him  and much peopl  7  12 now when he came nigh to the gate of the citi  behold  there was a dead man carri out  the onli son of his mother  and she was a widow  and much peopl of the citi was with her  7  13 and when the lord saw her  he had compass on her  and said unto her  weep not  7  14 and he came and touch the bier  and they that bare him stood still  and he said  young man  i say unto thee  aris  7  15 and he that was dead sat up  and began to speak  and he deliv him to his mother  7  16 and there came a fear on all  and they glorifi god  say  that a great prophet is risen up among us  and  that god hath visit his peopl  7  17 and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea  and throughout all the region round about  7  18 and the discipl of john shew him of all these thing  7  19 and john call unto him two of his discipl sent them to jesus  say  art thou he that should come  or look we for anoth  7  20 when the men were come unto him  they said  john baptist hath sent us unto thee  say  art thou he that should come  or look we for anoth  7  21 and in that same hour he cure mani of their infirm and plagu  and of evil spirit  and unto mani that were blind he gave sight  7  22 then jesus answer said unto them  go your way  and tell john what thing ye have seen and heard  how that the blind see  the lame walk  the leper are cleans  the deaf hear  the dead are rais  to the poor the gospel is preach  7  23 and bless is he  whosoev shall not be offend in me  7  24 and when the messeng of john were depart  he began to speak unto the peopl concern john  what went ye out into the wilder for to see  a reed shaken with the wind  7  25 but what went ye out for to see  a man cloth in soft raiment  behold  they which are gorgeous apparel  and live delic  are in king  court  7  26 but what went ye out for to see  a prophet  yea  i say unto you  and much more than a prophet  7  27 this is he  of whom it is written  behold  i send my messeng befor thi face  which shall prepar thi way befor thee  7  28 for i say unto you  among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist  but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he  7  29 and all the peopl that heard him  and the publican  justifi god  be baptiz with the baptism of john  7  30 but the pharise and lawyer reject the counsel of god against themselv  be not baptiz of him  7  31 and the lord said  whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generat  and to what are they like  7  32 they are like unto children sit in the marketplac  and call one to anoth  and say  we have pipe unto you  and ye have not danc  we have mourn to you  and ye have not wept  7  33 for john the baptist came neither eat bread nor drink wine  and ye say  he hath a devil  7  34 the son of man is come eat and drink  and ye say  behold a glutton man  and a winebibb  a friend of publican and sinner  7  35 but wisdom is justifi of all her children  7  36 and one of the pharise desir him that he would eat with him  and he went into the pharise  s hous  and sat down to meat  7  37 and  behold  a woman in the citi  which was a sinner  when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharise  s hous  brought an alabast box of ointment  7  38 and stood at his feet behind him weep  and began to wash his feet with tear  and did wipe them with the hair of her head  and kiss his feet  and anoint them with the ointment  7  39 now when the pharise which had bidden him saw it  he spake within himself  say  this man  if he were a prophet  would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him  for she is a sinner  7  40 and jesus answer said unto him  simon  i have somewhat to say unto thee  and he saith  master  say on  7  41 there was a certain creditor which had two debtor  the one owe five hundr penc  and the other fifti  7  42 and when they had noth to pay  he frank forgav them both  tell me therefor  which of them will love him most  7  43 simon answer and said  i suppos that he  to whom he forgav most  and he said unto him  thou hast right judg  7  44 and he turn to the woman  and said unto simon  seest thou this woman  i enter into thine hous  thou gavest me no water for my feet  but she hath wash my feet with tear  and wipe them with the hair of her head  7  45 thou gavest me no kiss  but this woman sinc the time i came in hath not ceas to kiss my feet  7  46 my head with oil thou didst not anoint  but this woman hath anoint my feet with ointment  7  47 wherefor i say unto thee  her sin  which are mani  are forgiven  for she love much  but to whom littl is forgiven  the same loveth littl  7  48 and he said unto her  thi sin are forgiven  7  49 and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselv  who is this that forgiveth sin also  7  50 and he said to the woman  thi faith hath save thee  go in peac  8  1 and it came to pass afterward  that he went throughout everi citi and villag  preach and shew the glad tide of the kingdom of god  and the twelv were with him  8  2 and certain women  which had been heal of evil spirit and infirm  mari call magdalen  out of whom went seven devil  8  3 and joanna the wife of chuza herod  s steward  and susanna  and mani other  which minist unto him of their substanc  8  4 and when much peopl were gather togeth  and were come to him out of everi citi  he spake by a parabl  8  5 a sower went out to sow his seed  and as he sow  some fell by the way side  and it was trodden down  and the fowl of the air devour it  8  6 and some fell upon a rock  and as soon as it was sprung up  it wither away  becaus it lack moistur  8  7 and some fell among thorn  and the thorn sprang up with it  and choke it  8  8 and other fell on good ground  and sprang up  and bare fruit an hundredfold  and when he had said these thing  he cri  he that hath ear to hear  let him hear  8  9 and his discipl ask him  say  what might this parabl be  8  10 and he said  unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the kingdom of god  but to other in parabl  that see they might not see  and hear they might not understand  8  11 now the parabl is this  the seed is the word of god  8  12 those by the way side are they that hear  then cometh the devil  and taketh away the word out of their heart  lest they should believ and be save  8  13 they on the rock are they  which  when they hear  receiv the word with joy  and these have no root  which for a while believ  and in time of temptat fall away  8  14 and that which fell among thorn are they  which  when they have heard  go forth  and are choke with care and rich and pleasur of this life  and bring no fruit to perfect  8  15 but that on the good ground are they  which in an honest and good heart  have heard the word  keep it  and bring forth fruit with patienc  8  16 no man  when he hath light a candl  covereth it with a vessel  or putteth it under a bed  but setteth it on a candlestick  that they which enter in may see the light  8  17 for noth is secret  that shall not be made manifest  neither ani thing hid  that shall not be known and come abroad  8  18 take heed therefor how ye hear  for whosoev hath  to him shall be given  and whosoev hath not  from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have  8  19 then came to him his mother and his brethren  and could not come at him for the press  8  20 and it was told him by certain which said  thi mother and thi brethren stand without  desir to see thee  8  21 and he answer and said unto them  my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god  and do it  8  22 now it came to pass on a certain day  that he went into a ship with his discipl  and he said unto them  let us go over unto the other side of the lake  and they launch forth  8  23 but as they sail he fell asleep  and there came down a storm of wind on the lake  and they were fill with water  and were in jeopardi  8  24 and they came to him  and awok him  say  master  master  we perish  then he aros  and rebuk the wind and the rage of the water  and they ceas  and there was a calm  8  25 and he said unto them  where is your faith  and they be afraid wonder  say one to anoth  what manner of man is this  for he commandeth even the wind and water  and they obey him  8  26 and they arriv at the countri of the gadaren  which is over against galile  8  27 and when he went forth to land  there met him out of the citi a certain man  which had devil long time  and ware no cloth  neither abod in ani hous  but in the tomb  8  28 when he saw jesus  he cri out  and fell down befor him  and with a loud voic said  what have i to do with thee  jesus  thou son of god most high  i beseech thee  torment me not  8  29  for he had command the unclean spirit to come out of the man  for oftentim it had caught him  and he was kept bound with chain and in fetter  and he brake the band  and was driven of the devil into the wilder  8  30 and jesus ask him  say  what is thi name  and he said  legion  becaus mani devil were enter into him  8  31 and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep  8  32 and there was there an herd of mani swine feed on the mountain  and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them  and he suffer them  8  33 then went the devil out of the man  and enter into the swine  and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the lake  and were choke  8  34 when they that fed them saw what was done  they fled  and went and told it in the citi and in the countri  8  35 then they went out to see what was done  and came to jesus  and found the man  out of whom the devil were depart  sit at the feet of jesus  cloth  and in his right mind  and they were afraid  8  36 they also which saw it told them by what mean he that was possess of the devil was heal  8  37 then the whole multitud of the countri of the gadaren round about besought him to depart from them  for they were taken with great fear  and he went up into the ship  and return back again  8  38 now the man out of whom the devil were depart besought him that he might be with him  but jesus sent him away  say  8  39 return to thine own hous  and shew how great thing god hath done unto thee  and he went his way  and publish throughout the whole citi how great thing jesus had done unto him  8  40 and it came to pass  that  when jesus was return  the peopl glad receiv him  for they were all wait for him  8  41 and  behold  there came a man name jairus  and he was a ruler of the synagogu  and he fell down at jesus  feet  and besought him that he would come into his hous  8  42 for he had one onli daughter  about twelv

44 came behind him  and touch the border of his garment  and immedi her issu of blood stanch  8  45 and jesus said  who touch me  when all deni  peter and they that were with him said  master  the multitud throng thee and press thee  and sayest thou  who touch me  8  46 and jesus said  somebodi hath touch me  for i perceiv that virtu is gone out of me  8  47 and when the woman saw that she was not hid  she came trembl  and fall down befor him  she declar unto him befor all the peopl for what caus she had touch him  and how she was heal immedi  8  48 and he said unto her  daughter  be of good comfort  thi faith hath made thee whole  go in peac  8  49 while he yet spake  there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogu  s hous  say to him  thi daughter is dead  troubl not the master  8  50 but when jesus heard it  he answer him  say  fear not  believ onli  and she shall be made whole  8  51 and when he came into the hous  he suffer no man to go in  save peter  and jame  and john  and the father and the mother of the maiden  8  52 and all wept  and bewail her  but he said  weep not  she is not dead  but sleepeth  8  53 and they laugh him to scorn  know that she was dead  8  54 and he put them all out  and took her by the hand  and call  say  maid  aris  8  55 and her spirit came again  and she aros straightway  and he command to give her meat  8  56 and her parent were astonish  but he charg them that they should tell no man what was done  9  1 then he call his twelv discipl togeth  and gave them power and author over all devil  and to cure diseas  9  2 and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god  and to heal the sick  9  3 and he said unto them  take noth for your journey  neither stave  nor scrip  neither bread  neither money  neither have two coat apiec  9  4 and whatsoev hous ye enter into  there abid  and thenc depart  9  5 and whosoev will not receiv you  when ye go out of that citi  shake off the veri dust from your feet for a testimoni against them  9  6 and they depart  and went through the town  preach the gospel  and heal everi where  9  7 now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him  and he was perplex  becaus that it was said of some  that john was risen from the dead  9  8 and of some  that elia had appear  and of other  that one of the old prophet was risen again  9  9 and herod said  john have i behead  but who is this  of whom i hear such thing  and he desir to see him  9  10 and the apostl  when they were return  told him all that they had done  and he took them  and went asid privat into a desert place belong to the citi call bethsaida  9  11 and the peopl  when they knew it  follow him  and he receiv them  and spake unto them of the kingdom of god  and heal them that had need of heal  9  12 and when the day began to wear away  then came the twelv  and said unto him  send the multitud away  that they may go into the town and countri round about  and lodg  and get victual  for we are here in a desert place  9  13 but he said unto them  give ye them to eat  and they said  we have no more but five loav and two fish  except we should go and buy meat for all this peopl  9  14 for they were about five thousand men  and he said to his discipl  make them sit down by fifti in a compani  9  15 and they did so  and made them all sit down  9  16 then he took the five loav and the two fish  and look up to heaven  he

after me  let him deni himself  and take up his cross daili  and follow me  9  24 for whosoev will save his life shall lose it  but whosoev will lose his life for my sake  the same shall save it  9  25 for what is a man advantag  if he gain the whole world  and lose himself  or be cast away  9  26 for whosoev shall be asham of me and of my word  of him shall the son of man be asham  when he shall come in his own glori  and in his father  s  and of the holi angel  9  27 but i tell you of a truth  there be some stand here  which shall not tast of death  till they see the kingdom of god  9  28 and it came to pass about an eight day after these say  he took peter and john and jame  and went up into a mountain to pray  9  29 and as he pray  the fashion of his counten was alter  and his raiment was white and glister  9  30 and  behold  there talk with him two men  which were mose and elia  9  31 who appear in glori  and spake of his deceas which he should accomplish at jerusalem  9  32 but peter and they that were with him were heavi with sleep  and when they were awak  they saw his glori  and the two men that stood with him  9  33 and it came to pass  as they depart from him  peter said unto jesus  master  it is good for us to be here  and let us make three tabernacl  one for thee  and one for mose  and one for elia  not know what he said  9  34 while he thus spake  there came a cloud  and overshadow them  and they fear as they enter into the cloud  9  35 and there came a voic out of the cloud  say  this is my belov son  hear him  9  36 and when the voic was past  jesus was found alon  and they kept it close  and told no man in those day ani of those thing which they had seen  9  37 and it came to pass  that on the next day  when they were come down from the hill  much peopl met him  9  38 and  behold  a man of the compani cri out  say  master  i beseech thee  look upon my son  for he is mine onli child  9  39 and  lo  a spirit taketh him  and he sudden crieth out  and it teareth him that he foameth again  and bruis him hard departeth from him  9  40 and i besought thi discipl to cast him out  and they could not  9  41 and jesus answer said  o faithless and pervers generat  how long shall i be with you  and suffer you  bring thi son hither  9  42 and as he was yet a come  the devil threw him down  and tare him  and jesus rebuk the unclean spirit  and heal the child  and deliv him again to his father  9  43 and they were all amaz at the mighti power of god  but while they wonder everi one at all thing which jesus did  he said unto his discipl  9  44 let these say sink down into your ear  for the son of man shall be deliv into the hand of men  9  45 but they understood not this say  and it was hid from them  that they perceiv it not  and they fear to ask him of that say  9  46 then there aros a reason among them  which of them should be greatest  9  47 and jesus  perceiv the thought of their heart  took a child  and set him by him  9  48 and said unto them  whosoev shall receiv this child in my name receiveth me  and whosoev shall receiv me receiveth him that sent me  for he that is least among you all  the same shall be great  9  49 and john answer and said  master  we saw one cast out devil in thi name  and we forbad him  becaus he followeth not with us  9  50 and jesus said unto him  forbid him not  for he that is not against us is for us  9  51 and it came to pass  when the time was come that he should be receiv up  he stedfast set his face to go to jerusalem  9  52 and sent messeng befor his face  and they went  and enter into a villag of the samaritan  to make readi for him  9  53 and they did not receiv him  becaus his face was as though he would go to jerusalem  9  54 and when his discipl jame and john saw this  they said  lord  wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven  and consum them  even as elia did  9  55 but he turn  and rebuk them  and said  ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of  9  56 for the son of man is not come to destroy men  s live  but to save them  and they went to anoth villag  9  57 and it came to pass  that  as they went in the way  a certain man said unto him  lord  i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest  9  58 and jesus said unto him  fox have hole  and bird of the air have nest  but the son of man hath not where to lay his head  9  59 and he said unto anoth  follow me  but he said  lord  suffer me first to go and buri my father  9  60 jesus said unto him  let the dead buri their dead  but go thou and preach the kingdom of god  9  61 and anoth also said  lord  i will follow thee  but let me first go bid them farewel  which are at home at my hous  9  62 and jesus said unto him  no man  have put his hand to the plough  and look back  is fit for the kingdom of god  10  1 after these thing the lord appoint other seventi also  and sent them two and two befor his face into everi citi and place  whither he himself would come  10  2 therefor said he unto them  the harvest truli is great  but the labour are few  pray ye therefor the lord of the harvest  that he would send forth labour into his harvest  10  3 go your way  behold  i send you forth as lamb among wolv  10  4 carri neither purs  nor scrip  nor shoe  and salut no man by the way  10  5 and into whatsoev hous ye enter  first say  peac be to this hous  10  6 and if the son of peac be there  your peac shall rest upon it  if not  it shall turn to you again  10  7 and in the same hous remain  eat and drink such thing as they give  for the labour is worthi of his hire  go not from hous to hous  10  8 and into whatsoev citi ye enter  and they receiv you  eat such thing as are set befor you  10  9 and heal the sick that are therein  and say unto them  the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you  10  10 but into whatsoev citi ye enter  and they receiv you not  go your way out into the street of the same  and say  10  11 even the veri dust of your citi  which cleaveth on us  we do wipe off against you  notwithstand be ye sure of this  that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you  10  12 but i say unto you  that it shall be more toler in that day for sodom  than for that citi  10  13 woe unto thee  chorazin  woe unto thee  bethsaida  for if the mighti work had been done in tyre and sidon  which have been done in you  they had a great while ago repent  sit in sackcloth and ash  10  14 but it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the judgment  than for you  10  15 and thou  capernaum  which art exalt to heaven  shalt be thrust down to hell  10  16 he that heareth you heareth me  and he that despiseth you despiseth me  and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me  10  17 and the seventi return again with joy  say  lord  even the devil are subject unto us through thi name  10  18 and he said unto them  i beheld satan as lightn fall from heaven  10  19 behold  i give unto you power to tread on serpent and scorpion  and over all the power of the enemi  and noth shall by ani mean hurt you  10  20 notwithstand in this rejoic not  that the spirit are subject unto you  but rather rejoic  becaus your name are written in heaven  10  21 in that hour jesus rejoic in spirit  and said  i thank thee  o father  lord of heaven and earth  that thou hast hid these thing from the wise and prudent  and hast reveal them unto babe  even so  father  for so it seem good in thi sight  10  22 all thing are deliv to me of my father  and no man knoweth who the son is  but the father  and who the father is  but the son  and he to whom the son will reveal him  10  23 and he turn him unto his discipl  and said privat  bless are the eye which see the thing that ye see  10  24 for i tell you  that mani prophet and king have desir to see those thing which ye see  and have not seen them  and to hear those thing which ye hear  and have not heard them  10  25 and  behold  a certain lawyer stood up  and tempt him  say  master  what shall i do to inherit etern life  10  26 he said unto him  what is written in the law  how readest thou  10  27 and he answer said  thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi heart  and with all thi soul  and with all thi strength  and with all thi mind  and thi neighbour as thyself  10  28 and he said unto him  thou hast answer right  this do  and thou shalt live  10  29 but he  will to justifi himself  said unto jesus  and who is my neighbour  10  30 and jesus answer said  a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho  and fell among thiev  which strip him of his raiment  and wound him  and depart  leav him half dead  10  31 and by chanc there came down a certain priest that way  and when he saw him  he pass by on the other side  10  32 and likewis a levit  when he was at the place  came and look on him  and pass by on the other side  10  33 but a certain samaritan  as he journey  came where he was  and when he saw him  he had compass on him  10  34 and went to him  and bound up his wound  pour in oil and wine  and set him on his own beast  and brought him to an inn  and took care of him  10  35 and on the morrow when he depart  he took out two penc  and gave them to the host  and said unto him  take care of him  and whatsoev thou spendest more  when i come again  i will repay thee  10  36 which now of these three  thinkest thou  was neighbour unto him that fell among the thiev  10  37 and he said  he that shew merci on him  then said jesus unto him  go  and do thou likewis  10  38 now it came to pass  as they went  that he enter into a certain villag  and a certain woman name martha receiv him into her hous  10  39 and she had a sister call mari  which also sat at jesus  feet  and heard his word  10  40 but martha was cumber about much serv  and came to him  and said  lord  dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serv alon  bid her therefor that she help me  10  41 and jesus answer and said unto her  martha  martha  thou art care and troubl about mani thing  10  42 but one thing is need  and mari hath chosen that good part  which shall not be taken away from her  11  1 and it came to pass  that  as he was pray in a certain place  when he ceas  one of his discipl said unto him  lord  teach us to pray  as john also taught his discipl  11  2 and he said unto them  when ye pray  say  our father which art in heaven  hallow be thi name  thi kingdom come  thi will be done  as in heaven  so in earth  11  3 give us day by day our daili bread  11  4 and forgiv us our sin  for we also forgiv everi one that is indebt to us  and lead us not into temptat  but deliv us from evil  11  5 and he said unto them  which of you shall have a friend  and shall go unto him at midnight  and say unto him  friend  lend me three loav  11  6 for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me  and i have noth to set befor him  11  7 and he from within shall answer and say  troubl me not  the door is now shut  and my children are with me in bed  i cannot rise and give thee  11  8 i say unto you  though he will not rise and give him  becaus he is his friend  yet becaus of his importun he will rise and give him as mani as he needeth  11  9 and i say unto you  ask  and it shall be given you  seek  and ye shall find  knock  and it shall be open unto you  11  10 for everi one that asketh receiveth  and he that seeketh findeth  and to him that knocketh it shall be open  11  11 if a son shall ask bread of ani of you that is a father  will he give him a stone  or if he ask a fish  will he for a fish give him a serpent  11  12 or if he shall ask an egg  will he offer him a scorpion  11  13 if ye then  be evil  know how to give good gift unto your children  how much more shall your heaven father give the holi spirit to them that ask him  11  14 and he was cast out a devil  and it was dumb  and it came to pass  when the devil was gone out  the dumb spake  and the peopl wonder  11  15 but some of them said  he casteth out devil through beelzebub the chief of the devil  11  16 and other  tempt him  sought of him a sign from heaven  11  17 but he  know their thought  said unto them  everi kingdom divid against itself is brought to desol  and a hous divid against a hous falleth  11  18 if satan also be divid against himself  how shall his kingdom stand  becaus ye say that i cast out devil through beelzebub  11  19 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil  by whom do your son cast them out  therefor shall they be your judg  11  20 but if i with the finger of god cast out devil  no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you  11  21 when a strong man arm keepeth his palac  his good are in peac  11  22 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him  and overcom him  he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trust  and divideth his spoil  11  23 he that is not with me is against me  and he that gathereth not with me scattereth  11  24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man  he walketh through dri place  seek rest  and find none  he saith  i will return unto my hous whenc i came out  11  25 and when he cometh  he findeth it swept and garnish  11  26 then goeth he  and taketh to him seven other spirit more wick than himself  and they enter in  and dwell there  and the last state of that man is wors than the first  11  27 and it came to pass  as he spake these thing  a certain woman of the compani lift up her voic  and said unto him  bless is the womb that bare thee  and the pap which thou hast suck  11  28 but he said  yea rather  bless are they that hear the word of god  and keep it  11  29 and when the peopl were gather thick togeth  he began to say  this is an evil generat  they seek a sign  and there shall no sign be given it  but the sign of jona the prophet  11  30 for as jona was a sign unto the ninevit  so shall also the son of man be to this generat  11  31 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generat  and condemn them  for she came from the utmost part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon  and  behold  a greater than solomon is here  11  32 the men of ninev shall rise up in the judgment with this generat  and shall condemn it  for they repent at the preach of jona  and  behold  a greater than jona is here  11  33 no man  when he hath light a candl  putteth it in a secret place  neither under a bushel  but on a candlestick  that they which come in may see the light  11  34 the light of the bodi is the eye  therefor when thine eye is singl  thi whole bodi also is full of light  but when thine eye is evil  thi bodi also is full of dark  11  35 take heed therefor that the light which is in thee be not dark  11  36 if thi whole bodi therefor be full of light  have no part dark  the whole shall be full of light  as when the bright shine of a candl doth give thee light  11  37 and as he spake  a certain pharise besought him to dine with him  and he went in  and sat down to meat  11  38 and when the pharise saw it  he marvel that he had not first wash befor dinner  11  39 and the lord said unto him  now do ye pharise make clean the outsid of the cup and the platter  but your inward part is full of raven and wicked  11  40 ye fool  did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also  11  41 but rather give alm of such thing as ye have  and  behold  all thing are clean unto you  11  42 but woe unto you  pharise  for ye tith mint and rue and all manner of herb  and pass over judgment and the love of god  these ought ye to have done  and not to leav the other undon  11  43 woe unto you  pharise  for ye love the uppermost seat in the synagogu  and greet in the market  11  44 woe unto you  scribe and pharise  hypocrit  for ye are as grave which appear not  and the men that walk over them are not awar of them  11  45 then answer one of the lawyer  and said unto him  master  thus say thou reproachest us also  11  46 and he said  woe unto you also  ye lawyer  for ye lade men with burden grievous to be born  and ye yourselv touch not the burden with one of your finger  11  47 woe unto you  for ye build the sepulchr of the prophet  and your father kill them  11  48 truli ye bear wit that ye allow the deed of your father  for they inde kill them  and ye build their sepulchr  11  49 therefor also said the wisdom of god  i will send them prophet and apostl  and some of them they shall slay and persecut  11  50 that the blood of all the prophet  which was shed from the foundat of the world  may be requir of this generat  11  51 from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharia which perish between the altar and the templ  verili i say unto you  it shall be requir of this generat  11  52 woe unto you  lawyer  for ye have taken away the key of knowledg  ye enter not in yourselv  and them that were enter in ye hinder  11  53 and as he said these thing unto them  the scribe and the pharise began to urg him vehement  and to provok him to speak of mani thing  11  54 lay wait for him  and seek to catch someth out of his mouth  that they might accus him  12  1 in the mean time  when there were gather togeth an innumer multitud of peopl  insomuch that they trode one upon anoth  he began to say unto his discipl first of all  bewar ye of the leaven of the pharise  which is hypocrisi  12  2 for there is noth cover  that shall not be reveal  neither hid  that shall not be known  12  3 therefor whatsoev ye have spoken in dark shall be heard in the light  and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closet shall be proclaim upon the housetop  12  4 and i say unto you my friend  be not afraid of them that kill the bodi  and after that have no more that they can do  12  5 but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear  fear him  which after he hath kill hath power to cast into hell  yea  i say unto you  fear him  12  6 are not five sparrow sold for two farth  and not one of them is forgotten befor god  12  7 but even the veri hair of your head are all number  fear not therefor  ye are of more valu than mani sparrow  12  8 also i say unto you  whosoev shall confess me befor men  him shall the son of man also confess befor the angel of god  12  9 but he that denieth me befor men shall be deni befor the angel of god  12  10 and whosoev shall speak a word against the son of man  it shall be forgiven him  but unto him that blasphemeth against the holi ghost it shall not be forgiven  12  11 and when they bring you unto the synagogu  and unto magistr  and power  take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer  or what ye shall say  12  12 for the holi ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say  12  13 and one of the compani said unto him  master  speak to my brother  that he divid the inherit with me  12  14 and he said unto him  man  who made me a judg or a divid over you  12  15 and he said unto them  take heed  and bewar of covet  for a man  s life consisteth not in the abund of the thing which he possesseth  12  16 and he spake a parabl unto them  say  the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plenti  12  17 and he thought within himself  say  what shall i do  becaus i have no room where to bestow my fruit  12  18 and he said  this will i do  i will pull down my barn  and build greater  and there will i bestow all my fruit and my good  12  19 and i will say to my soul  soul  thou hast much good laid up for mani year  take thine eas  eat  drink  and be merri  12  20 but god said unto him  thou fool  this night thi soul shall be requir of thee  then whose shall those thing be  which thou hast provid  12  21 so is he that layeth up treasur for himself  and is not rich toward god  12  22 and he said unto his discipl  therefor i say unto you  take no thought for your life  what ye shall eat  neither for the bodi  what ye shall put on  12  23 the life is more than meat  and the bodi is more than raiment  12  24 consid the raven  for they neither sow nor reap  which neither have storehous nor barn  and god feedeth them  how much more are ye better than the fowl  12  25 and which of you with take thought can add to his statur one cubit  12  26 if ye then be not abl to do that thing which is least  whi take ye thought for the rest  12  27 consid the lili how they grow  they toil not  they spin not  and yet i say unto you  that solomon in all his glori was not array like one of these  12  28 if then god so cloth the grass  which is to day in the field  and to morrow is cast into the oven  how much more will he cloth you  o ye of littl faith  12  29 and seek not ye what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink  neither be ye of doubt mind  12  30 for all these thing do the nation of the world seek after  and your father knoweth that ye have need of these thing  12  31 but rather seek ye the kingdom of god  and all these thing shall be ad unto you  12  32 fear not  littl flock  for it is your father  s good pleasur to give you the kingdom  12  33 sell that ye have  and give alm  provid yourselv bag which wax not old  a treasur in the heaven that faileth not  where no thief approacheth  neither moth corrupteth  12  34 for where your treasur is  there will your heart be also  12  35 let your loin be gird about  and your light burn  12  36 and ye yourselv like unto men that wait for their lord  when he will return from the wed  that when he cometh and knocketh  they may open unto him immedi  12  37 bless are those servant  whom the lord when he cometh shall find watch  verili i say unto you  that he shall gird himself  and make them to sit down to meat  and will come forth and serv them  12  38 and if he shall come in the second watch  or come in the third watch  and find them so  bless are those servant  12  39 and this know  that if the goodman of the hous had known what hour the thief would come  he would have watch  and not have suffer his hous to be broken through  12  40 be ye therefor readi also  for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not  12  41 then peter said unto him  lord  speakest thou this parabl unto us  or even to all  12  42 and the lord said  who then is that faith and wise steward  whom his lord shall make ruler over his household  to give them their portion of meat in due season  12  43 bless is that servant  whom his lord when he cometh shall find so do  12  44 of a truth i say unto you  that he will make him ruler over all that he hath  12  45 but and if that servant say in his heart  my lord delayeth his come  and shall begin to beat the menserv and maiden  and to eat and drink  and to be drunken  12  46 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him  and at an hour when he is not awar  and will cut him in sunder  and will appoint him his portion with the unbeliev  12  47 and that servant  which knew his lord  s will  and prepar not himself  neither did accord to his will  shall be beaten with mani stripe  12  48 but he that knew not  and did commit thing worthi of stripe  shall be beaten with few stripe  for unto whomsoev much is given  of him shall be much requir  and to whom men have commit much  of him they will ask the more  12  49 i am come to send fire on the earth  and what will i  if it be alreadi kindl  12  50 but i have a baptism to be baptiz with  and how am i straiten till it be accomplish  12  51 suppos ye that i am come to give peac on earth  i tell you  nay  but rather divis  12  52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one hous divid  three against two  and two against three  12  53 the father shall be divid against the son  and the son against the father  the mother against the daughter  and the daughter against the mother  the mother in law against her daughter in law  and the daughter in law against her mother in law  12  54 and he said also to the peopl  when ye see a cloud rise out of the west  straightway ye say  there cometh a shower  and so it is  12  55 and when ye see the south wind blow  ye say  there will be heat  and it cometh to pass  12  56 ye hypocrit  ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth  but how is it that ye do not discern this time  12  57 yea  and whi even of yourselv judg ye not what is right  12  58 when thou goest with thine adversari to the magistr  as thou art in the way  give dilig that thou mayest be deliv from him  lest he hale thee to the judg  and the judg deliv thee to the offic  and the offic cast thee into prison  12  59 i tell thee  thou shalt not depart thenc  till thou hast paid the veri last mite  13  1 there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaean  whose blood pilat had mingl with their sacrific  13  2 and jesus answer said unto them  suppos ye that these galilaean were sinner abov all the galilaean  becaus they suffer such thing  13  3 i tell you  nay  but  except ye repent  ye shall all likewis perish  13  4 or those eighteen  upon whom the tower in siloam fell  and slew them  think ye that they were sinner abov all men that dwelt in jerusalem  13  5 i tell you  nay  but  except ye repent  ye shall all likewis perish  13  6 he spake also this parabl  a certain man had a fig tree plant in his vineyard  and he came and sought fruit thereon  and found none  13  7 then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard  behold  these three year i come seek fruit on this fig tree  and find none  cut it down  whi cumbereth it the ground  13  8 and he answer said unto him  lord  let it alon this year also  till i shall dig about it  and dung it  13  9 and if it bear fruit  well  and if not  then after that thou shalt cut it down  13  10 and he was teach in one of the synagogu on the sabbath  13  11 and  behold  there was a woman which had a spirit of infirm eighteen year  and was bow togeth  and could in no wise lift up herself  13  12 and when jesus saw her  he call her to him  and said unto her  woman  thou art loos from thine infirm  13  13 and he laid his hand on her  and immedi she was made straight  and glorifi god  13  14 and the ruler of the synagogu answer with indign  becaus that jesus had heal on the sabbath day  and said unto the peopl  there are six day in which men ought to work  in them therefor come and be heal  and not on the sabbath day  13  15 the lord then answer him  and said  thou hypocrit  doth not each one of you on the sabbath loos his ox or his ass from the stall  and lead him away to water  13  16 and ought not this woman  be a daughter of abraham  whom satan hath bound  lo  these eighteen year  be loos from this bond on the sabbath day  13  17 and when he had said these thing  all his adversari were asham  and all the peopl rejoic for all the glorious thing that were done by him  13  18 then said he  unto what is the kingdom of god like  and whereunto shall i resembl it  13  19 it is like a grain of mustard seed  which a man took  and cast into his garden  and it grew  and wax a great tree  and the fowl of the air lodg in the branch of it  13  20 and again he said  whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god  13  21 it is like leaven  which a woman took and hid in three measur of meal  till the whole was leaven  13  22 and he went through the citi and villag  teach  and journey toward jerusalem  13  23 then said one unto him  lord  are there few that be save  and he said unto them  13  24 strive to enter in at the strait gate  for mani  i say unto you  will seek to enter in  and shall not be abl  13  25 when onc the master of the hous is risen up  and hath shut to the door  and ye begin to stand without  and to knock at the door  say  lord  lord  open unto us  and he shall answer and say unto you  i know you not whenc ye are  13  26 then shall ye begin to say  we have eaten and drunk in thi presenc  and thou hast taught in our street  13  27 but he shall say  i

the kingdom of god  and you yourselv thrust out  13  29 and they shall come from the east  and from the west  and from the north  and from the south  and shall sit down in the kingdom of god  13  30 and  behold  there are last which shall be first  and there are first which shall be last  13  31 the same day there came certain of the pharise  say unto him  get thee out  and depart henc  for herod will kill thee  13  32 and he said unto them  go ye  and tell that fox  behold  i cast out devil  and i do cure to day and to morrow  and the third day i shall be perfect  13  33 nevertheless i must walk to day  and to morrow  and the day follow  for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem  13  34 o jerusalem  jerusalem  which killest the prophet  and stonest them that are sent unto thee  how often would i have gather thi children togeth  as a hen doth gather her brood under her wing  and ye would not  13  35 behold  your hous is left unto you desol  and verili i say unto you  ye shall not see me  until the time come when ye shall say  bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord  14  1 and it came to pass  as he went into the hous of one of the chief pharise to eat bread on the sabbath day  that they watch him  14  2 and  behold  there was a certain man befor him which had the dropsi  14  3 and jesus answer spake unto the lawyer and pharise  say  is it law to heal on the sabbath day  14  4 and they held their peac  and he took him  and heal him  and let him go  14  5 and answer them  say  which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit  and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day  14  6 and they could not answer him again to these thing  14  7 and he put forth a parabl to those which were bidden  when he mark how they chose out the chief room  say unto them  14  8 when thou art bidden of ani man to a wed  sit not down in the highest room  lest a more honour man than thou be bidden of him  14  9 and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee  give this man place  and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room  14  10 but when thou art bidden  go and sit down in the lowest room  that when he that bade thee cometh  he may say unto thee  friend  go up higher  then shalt thou have worship in the presenc of them that sit at meat with thee  14  11 for whosoev exalteth himself shall be abas  and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt  14  12 then said he also to him that bade him  when thou makest a dinner or a supper  call not thi friend  nor thi brethren  neither thi kinsmen  nor thi rich neighbour  lest they also bid thee again  and a recomp be made thee  14  13 but when thou makest a feast  call the poor  the maim  the lame  the blind  14  14 and thou shalt be bless  for they cannot recompens thee  for thou shalt be recompens at the resurrect of the just  14  15 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these thing  he said unto him  bless is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god  14  16 then said he unto him  a certain man made a great supper  and bade mani  14  17 and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden  come  for all thing are now readi  14  18 and they all with one consent began to make excus  the first said unto him  i have bought a piec of ground  and i must need go and see it  i pray thee have me excus  14  19 and anoth said  i have bought five yoke of oxen  and i go to prove them  i pray thee have me excus  14  20 and anoth said  i have marri a wife  and therefor i cannot come  14  21 so that servant came  and shew his lord these thing  then the master of the hous be angri said to his servant  go out quick into the street and lane of the citi  and bring in hither the poor  and the maim  and the halt  and the blind  14  22 and the servant said  lord  it is done as thou hast command  and yet there is room  14  23 and the lord said unto the servant  go out into the highway and hedg  and compel them to come in  that my hous may be fill  14  24 for i say unto you  that none of those men which were bidden shall tast of my supper  14  25 and there went great multitud with him  and he turn  and said unto them  14  26 if ani man come to me  and hate not his father  and mother  and wife  and children  and brethren  and sister  yea  and his own life also  he cannot be my discipl  14  27 and whosoev doth not bear his cross  and come after me  cannot be my discipl  14  28 for which of you  intend to build a tower  sitteth not down first  and counteth the cost  whether he have suffici to finish it  14  29 lest hapli  after he hath laid the foundat  and is not abl to finish it  all that behold it begin to mock him  14  30 say  this man began to build  and was not abl to finish  14  31 or what king  go to make war against anoth king  sitteth not down first  and consulteth whether he be abl with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenti thousand  14  32 or els  while the other is yet a great way off  he sendeth an ambassag  and desireth condit of peac  14  33 so likewis  whosoev he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath  he cannot be my discipl  14  34 salt is good  but if the salt have lost his savour  wherewith shall it be season  14  35 it is neither fit for the land  nor yet for the dunghil  but men cast it out  he that hath ear to hear  let him hear  15  1 then drew near unto him all the publican and sinner for to hear him  15  2 and the pharise and scribe murmur  say  this man receiveth sinner  and eateth with them  15  3 and he spake this parabl unto them  say  15  4 what man of you  have an hundr sheep  if he lose one of them  doth not leav the nineti and nine in the wilder  and go after that which is lost  until he find it  15  5 and when he hath found it  he layeth it on his shoulder  rejoic  15  6 and when he cometh home  he calleth togeth his friend and neighbour  say unto them  rejoic with me  for i have found my sheep which was lost  15  7 i say unto you  that likewis joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth  more than over nineti and nine just person  which need no repent  15  8 either what woman have ten piec of silver  if she lose one piec  doth not light a candl  and sweep the hous  and seek dilig till she find it  15  9 and when she hath found it  she calleth her friend and her neighbour togeth  say  rejoic with me  for i have found the piec which i had lost  15  10 likewis  i say unto you  there is joy in the presenc of the angel of god over one sinner that repenteth  15  11 and he said  a certain man had two son  15  12 and the younger of them said to his father  father  give me the portion of good that falleth to me  and he divid unto them his live  15  13 and not mani day after the younger son gather all togeth  and took his journey into a far countri  and there wast his substanc with riotous live  15  14 and when he had spent all  there aros a mighti famin in that land  and he began to be in want  15  15 and he went and join himself to a citizen of that countri  and he sent him into his field to feed swine  15  16 and he would fain have fill his belli with the husk that the swine did eat  and no man gave unto him  15  17 and when he came to himself  he said  how mani hire servant of my father  s have bread enough and to spare  and i perish with hunger  15  18 i will aris and go to my father  and will say unto him  father  i have sin against heaven  and befor thee  15  19 and am no more worthi to be call thi son  make me as one of thi hire servant  15  20 and he aros  and came to his father  but when he was yet a great way off  his father saw him  and had compass  and ran  and fell on his neck  and kiss him  15  21 and the son said unto him  father  i have sin against heaven  and in thi sight  and am no more worthi to be call thi son  15  22 but the father said to his servant  bring forth the best robe  and put it on him  and put a ring on his hand  and shoe on his feet  15  23 and bring hither the fat calf  and kill it  and let us eat  and be merri  15  24 for this my son was dead  and is aliv again  he was lost  and is found  and they began to be merri  15  25 now his elder son was in the field  and as he came and drew nigh to the hous  he heard musick and danc  15  26 and he call one of the servant  and ask what these thing meant  15  27 and he said unto him  thi brother is come  and thi father hath kill the fat calf  becaus he hath receiv him safe and sound  15  28 and he was angri  and would not go in  therefor came his father out  and intreat him  15  29 and he answer said to his father  lo  these mani year do i serv thee  neither transgress i at ani time thi command  and yet thou never gavest me a kid  that i might make merri with my friend  15  30 but as soon as this thi son was come  which hath devour thi live with harlot  thou hast kill for him the fat calf  15  31 and he said unto him  son  thou art ever with me  and all that i have is thine  15  32 it was meet that we should make merri  and be glad  for this thi brother was dead  and is aliv again  and was lost  and is found  16  1 and he said also unto his discipl  there was a certain rich man  which had a steward  and the same was accus unto him that he had wast his good  16  2 and he call him  and said unto him  how is it that i hear this of thee  give an account of thi stewardship  for thou mayest be no longer steward  16  3 then the steward said within himself  what shall i do  for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship  i cannot dig  to beg i am asham  16  4 i am resolv what to do  that  when i am put out of the stewardship  they may receiv me into their hous  16  5 so he call everi one of his lord  s debtor unto him  and said unto the first  how much owest thou unto my lord  16  6 and he said  an hundr measur of oil  and he said unto him  take thi bill  and sit down quick  and write fifti  16  7 then said he to anoth  and how much owest thou  and he said  an hundr measur of wheat  and he said unto him  take thi bill  and write fourscor  16  8 and the lord commend the unjust steward  becaus he had done wise  for the children of this world are in their generat wiser than the children of light  16  9 and i say unto you  make to yourselv friend of the mammon of unright  that  when ye fail  they may receiv you into everlast habit  16  10 he that is faith in that which is least is faith also in much  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much  16  11 if therefor ye have not been faith in the unright mammon  who will commit to your trust the true rich  16  12 and if ye have not been faith in that which is anoth man  s  who shall give you that which is your own  16  13 no servant can serv two master  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or els he will hold to the one  and despis the other  ye cannot serv god and mammon  16  14 and the pharise also  who were covet  heard all these thing  and they derid him  16  15 and he said unto them  ye are they which justifi yourselv befor men  but god knoweth your heart  for that which is high esteem among men is abomin in the sight of god  16  16 the law and the prophet were until john  sinc that time the kingdom of god is preach  and everi man presseth into it  16  17 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass  than one tittl of the law to fail  16  18 whosoev putteth away his wife  and marrieth anoth  committeth adulteri  and whosoev marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adulteri  16  19 there was a certain rich man  which was cloth in purpl and fine linen  and fare sumptuous everi day  16  20 and there was a certain beggar name lazarus  which was laid at his gate  full of sore  16  21 and desir to be fed with the crumb which fell from the rich man  s tabl  moreov the dog came and lick his sore  16  22 and it came to pass  that the beggar die  and was carri by the angel into abraham  s bosom  the rich man also die  and was buri  16  23 and in hell he lift up his eye  be in torment  and seeth abraham afar off  and lazarus in his bosom  16  24 and he cri and said  father abraham  have merci on me  and send lazarus  that he may dip the tip of his finger in water  and cool my tongu  for i am torment in this flame  16  25 but abraham said  son  rememb that thou in thi lifetim receivedst thi good thing  and likewis lazarus evil thing  but now he is comfort  and thou art torment  16  26 and besid all this  between us and you there is a great gulf fix  so that they which would pass from henc to you cannot  neither can they pass to us  that would come from thenc  16  27 then he said  i pray thee therefor  father  that thou wouldest send him to my father  s hous  16  28 for i have five brethren  that he may testifi unto them  lest they also come into this place of torment  16  29 abraham saith unto him  they have mose and the prophet  let them hear them  16  30 and he said  nay  father abraham  but if one went unto them from the dead  they will repent  16  31 and he said unto him  if they hear not mose and the prophet  neither will they be persuad  though one rose from the dead  17  1 then said he unto the discipl  it is imposs but that offenc will come  but woe unto him  through whom they come  17  2 it were better for him that a millston were hang about his neck  and he cast into the sea  than that he should offend one of these littl one  17  3 take heed to yourselv  if thi brother trespass against thee  rebuk him  and if he repent  forgiv him  17  4 and if he trespass against thee seven time in a day  and seven time in a day turn again to thee  say  i repent  thou shalt forgiv him  17  5 and the apostl said unto the lord  increas our faith  17  6 and the lord said  if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed  ye might say unto this sycamin tree  be thou pluck up by the root  and be thou plant in the sea  and it should obey you  17  7 but which of you  have a servant plow or feed cattl  will say unto him by and by  when he is come from the field  go and sit down to meat  17  8 and will not rather say unto him  make readi wherewith i may sup  and gird thyself  and serv me  till i have eaten and drunken  and afterward thou shalt eat and drink  17  9 doth he thank that servant becaus he did the thing that were command him  i trow not  17  10 so likewis ye  when ye shall have done all those thing which are command you  say  we are unprofit servant  we have done that which was our duti to do  17  11 and it came to pass  as he went to jerusalem  that he pass through the midst of samaria and galile  17  12 and as he enter into a certain villag  there met him ten men that were leper  which stood afar off  17  13 and they lift up their voic  and said  jesus  master  have merci on us  17  14 and when he saw them  he said unto them  go shew yourselv unto the priest  and it came to pass  that  as they went  they were cleans  17  15 and one of them  when he saw that he was heal  turn back  and with a loud voic glorifi god  17  16 and fell down on his face at his feet  give him thank  and he was a samaritan  17  17 and jesus answer said  were there not ten cleans  but where are the nine  17  18 there are not found that return to give glori to god  save this stranger  17  19 and he said unto him  aris  go thi way  thi faith hath made thee whole  17  20 and when he was demand of the pharise  when the kingdom of god should come  he answer them and said  the kingdom of god cometh not with observ  17  21 neither shall they say  lo here  or  lo there  for  behold  the kingdom of god is within you  17  22 and he said unto the discipl  the day will come  when ye shall desir to see one of the day of the son of man  and ye shall not see it  17  23 and they shall say to you  see here  or  see there  go not after them  nor follow them  17  24 for as the lightn  that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven  shineth unto the other part under heaven  so shall also the son of man be in his day  17  25 but first must he suffer mani thing  and be reject of this generat  17  26 and as it was in the day of noe  so shall it be also in the day of the son of man  17  27 they did eat  they drank  they marri wive  they were given in marriag  until the day that noe enter into the ark  and the flood came  and destroy them all  17  28 likewis also as it was in the day of lot  they did eat  they drank  they bought  they sold  they plant  they build  17  29 but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rain fire and brimston from heaven  and destroy them all  17  30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is reveal  17  31 in that day  he which shall be upon the housetop  and his stuff in the hous  let him not come down to take it away  and he that is in the field  let him likewis not return back  17  32 rememb lot  s wife  17  33 whosoev shall seek to save his life shall lose it  and whosoev shall lose his life shall preserv it  17  34 i tell you  in that night there shall be two men in one bed  the one shall be taken  and the other shall be left  17  35 two women shall be grind togeth  the one shall be taken  and the other left  17  36 two men shall be in the field  the one shall be taken  and the other left  17  37 and they answer and said unto him  where  lord  and he said unto them  wheresoev the bodi is  thither will the eagl be gather togeth  18  1 and he spake a parabl unto them to this end  that men ought alway to pray  and not to faint  18  2 say  there was in a citi a judg  which fear not god  neither regard man  18  3 and there was a widow in that citi  and she came unto him  say  aveng me of mine adversari  18  4 and he would not for a while  but afterward he said within himself  though i fear not god  nor regard man  18  5 yet becaus this widow troubleth me  i will aveng her  lest by her continu come she weari me  18  6 and the lord said  hear what the unjust judg saith  18  7 and shall not god aveng his own elect  which cri day and night unto him  though he bear long with them  18  8 i tell you that he will aveng them speedili  nevertheless when the son of man cometh  shall he find faith on the earth  18  9 and he spake this parabl unto certain which trust in themselv that they were righteous  and despis other  18  10 two men went up into the templ to pray  the one a pharise  and the other a publican  18  11 the pharise stood and pray thus with himself  god  i thank thee  that i am not as other men are  extortion  unjust  adulter  or even as this publican  18  12 i fast twice in the week  i give tith of all that i possess  18  13 and the publican  stand afar off  would not lift up so much as his eye unto heaven  but smote upon his breast  say  god be merci to me a sinner  18  14 i tell you  this man went down to his hous justifi rather than the other  for everi one that exalteth himself shall be abas  and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt  18  15 and they brought unto him also infant  that he would touch them  but when his discipl saw it  they rebuk them  18  16 but jesus call them unto him  and said  suffer littl children to come unto me  and forbid them not  for of such is the kingdom of god  18  17 verili i say unto you  whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom of god as a littl child shall in no wise enter therein  18  18 and a certain ruler ask him  say  good master  what shall i do to inherit etern life  18  19 and jesus said unto him  whi callest thou me good  none is good  save one  that is  god  18  20 thou knowest the command  do not commit adulteri  do not kill  do not steal  do not bear fals wit  honour thi father and thi mother  18  21 and he said  all these have i kept from my youth up  18  22 now when jesus heard these thing  he said unto him  yet lackest thou one thing  sell all that thou hast  and distribut unto the poor  and thou shalt have treasur in heaven  and come  follow me  18  23 and when he heard this  he was veri sorrow  for he was veri rich  18  24 and when jesus saw that he was veri sorrow  he said  how hard shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god  18  25 for it is easier for a camel to go through a needl  s eye  than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god  18  26 and they that heard it said  who then can be save  18  27 and he said  the thing which are imposs with men are possibl with god  18  28 then peter said  lo  we have left all  and follow thee  18  29 and he said unto them  verili i say unto you  there is no man that hath left hous  or parent  or brethren  or wife  or children  for the kingdom of god  s sake  18  30 who shall not receiv manifold more in this present time  and in the world to come life everlast  18  31 then he took unto him the twelv  and said unto them  behold  we go up to jerusalem  and all thing that are written by the prophet concern the son of man shall be accomplish  18  32 for he shall be deliv unto the gentil  and shall be mock  and spite entreat  and spit on  18  33 and they shall scourg him  and put him to death  and the third day he shall rise again  18  34 and they understood none of these thing  and this say was hid from them  neither knew they the thing which were spoken  18  35 and it came to pass  that as he was come nigh unto jericho  a certain blind man sat by the way side beg  18  36 and hear the multitud pass by  he ask what it meant  18  37 and they told him  that jesus of nazareth passeth by  18  38 and he cri  say  jesus  thou son of david  have merci on me  18  39 and they which went befor rebuk him  that he should hold his peac  but he cri so much the more  thou son of david  have merci on me  18  40 and jesus stood  and command him to be brought unto him  and when he was come near  he ask him  18  41 say  what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee  and he said  lord  that i may receiv my sight  18  42 and jesus said unto him  receiv thi sight  thi faith hath save thee  18  43 and immedi he receiv his sight  and follow him  glorifi god  and all the peopl  when they saw it  gave prais unto god  19  1 and jesus enter and pass through jericho  19  2 and  behold  there was a man name zacchaeus  which was the chief among the publican  and he was rich  19  3 and he sought to see jesus who he was  and could not for the press  becaus he was littl of statur  19  4 and he ran befor  and climb up into a sycomor tree to see him  for he was to pass that way  19  5 and when jesus came to the place  he look up  and saw him  and said unto him  zacchaeus  make hast  and come down  for to day i must abid at thi hous  19  6 and he made hast  and came down  and receiv him joy  19  7 and when they saw it  they all murmur  say  that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner  19  8 and zacchaeus stood  and said unto the lord  behold  lord  the half of my good i give to the poor  and if i have taken ani thing from ani man by fals accus  i restor him fourfold  19  9 and jesus said unto him  this day is salvat come to this hous  forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham  19  10 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  19  11 and as they heard these thing  he ad and spake a parabl  becaus he was nigh to jerusalem  and becaus they thought that the kingdom of god should immedi appear  19  12 he said therefor  a certain nobleman went into a far countri to receiv for himself a kingdom  and to return  19  13 and he call his ten servant  and deliv them ten pound  and said unto them  occupi till i come  19  14 but his citizen hate him  and sent a messag after him  say  we will not have this man to reign over us  19  15 and it came to pass  that when he was return  have receiv the kingdom  then he command these servant to be call unto him  to whom he had given the money  that he might know how much everi man had gain by trade  19  16 then came the first  say  lord  thi pound hath gain ten pound  19  17 and he said unto him  well  thou good servant  becaus thou hast been faith in a veri littl  have thou author over ten citi  19  18 and the second came  say  lord  thi pound hath gain five pound  19  19 and he said likewis to him  be thou also over five citi  19  20 and anoth came  say  lord  behold  here is thi pound  which i have kept laid up in a napkin  19  21 for i fear thee  becaus thou art an auster man  thou takest up that thou layedst not down  and reapest that thou didst not sow  19  22 and he saith unto him  out of thine own mouth will i judg thee  thou wick servant  thou knewest that i was an auster man  take up that i laid not down  and reap that i did not sow  19  23 wherefor then gavest not thou my money into the bank  that at my come i might have requir mine own with usuri  19  24 and he said unto them that stood by  take from him the pound  and give it to him that hath ten pound  19  25  and they said unto him  lord  he hath ten pound  19  26 for i say unto you  that unto everi one which hath shall be given  and from him that hath not  even that he hath shall be taken away from him  19  27 but those mine enemi  which would not that i should reign over them  bring hither  and slay them befor me  19  28 and when he had thus spoken  he went befor  ascend up to jerusalem  19  29 and it came to pass  when he was come nigh to bethphag and bethani  at the mount call the mount of oliv  he sent two of his discipl  19  30 say  go ye into the villag over against you  in the which at your enter ye shall find a colt tie  whereon yet never man sat  loos him  and bring him hither  19  31 and if ani man ask you  whi do ye loos him  thus shall ye say unto him  becaus the lord hath need of him  19  32 and they that were sent went their way  and found even as he had said unto them  19  33 and as they were loos the colt  the owner thereof said unto them  whi loos ye the colt  19  34 and they said  the lord hath need of him  19  35 and they brought him to jesus  and they cast their garment upon the colt  and they set jesus thereon  19  36 and as he went  they spread their cloth in the way  19  37 and when he was come nigh  even now at the descent of the mount of oliv  the whole multitud of the discipl began to rejoic and prais god with a loud voic for all the mighti work that they had seen  19  38 say  bless be the king that cometh in the name of the lord  peac in heaven  and glori in the highest  19  39 and some of the pharise from among the multitud said unto him  master  rebuk thi discipl  19  40 and he answer and said unto them  i tell you that  if these should hold their peac  the stone would immedi cri out  19  41 and when he was come near  he beheld the citi  and wept over it  19  42 say  if thou hadst known  even thou  at least in this thi day  the thing which belong unto thi peac  but now they are hid from thine eye  19  43 for the day shall come upon thee  that thine enemi shall cast a trench about thee  and compass thee round  and keep thee in on everi side  19  44 and shall lay thee even with the ground  and thi children within thee  and they shall not leav in thee one stone upon anoth  becaus thou knewest not the time of thi visit  19  45 and he went into the templ  and began to cast out them that sold therein  and them that bought  19  46 say unto them  it is written  my hous is the hous of prayer  but ye have made it a den of thiev  19  47 and he taught daili in the templ  but the chief priest and the scribe and the chief of the peopl sought to destroy him  19  48 and could not find what they might do  for all the peopl were veri attent to hear him  20  1 and it came to pass  that on one of those day  as he taught the peopl in the templ  and preach the gospel  the chief priest and the scribe came upon him with the elder  20  2 and spake unto him  say  tell us  by what author doest thou these thing  or who is he that gave thee this author  20  3 and he answer and said unto them  i will also ask you one thing  and answer me  20  4 the baptism of john  was it from heaven  or of men  20  5 and they reason with themselv  say  if we shall say  from heaven  he will say  whi then believ ye him not  20  6 but and if we say  of men  all the peopl will stone us  for they be persuad that john was a prophet  20  7 and they answer  that they could not tell whenc it was  20  8 and jesus said unto them  neither tell i you by what author i do these thing  20  9 then began he to speak to the peopl this parabl  a certain man plant a vineyard  and let it forth to husbandmen  and went into a far countri for a long time  20  10 and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen  that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard  but the husbandmen beat him  and sent him away empti  20  11 and again he sent anoth servant  and they beat him also  and entreat him shame  and sent him away empti  20  12 and again he sent a third  and they wound him also  and cast him out  20  13 then said the lord of the vineyard  what shall i do  i will send my belov son  it may be they will rever him when they see him  20  14 but when the husbandmen saw him  they reason among themselv  say  this is the heir  come  let us kill him  that the inherit may be our  20  15 so they cast him out of the vineyard  and kill him  what therefor shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them  20  16 he shall come and destroy these husbandmen  and shall give the vineyard to other  and when they heard it  they said  god forbid  20  17 and he beheld them  and said  what is this then that is written  the stone which the builder reject  the same is becom the head of the corner  20  18 whosoev shall fall upon that stone shall be broken  but on whomsoev it shall fall  it will grind him to powder  20  19 and the chief priest and the scribe the same hour sought to lay hand on him  and they fear the peopl  for they perceiv that he had spoken this parabl against them  20  20 and they watch him  and sent forth spi  which should feign themselv just men  that they might take hold of his word  that so they might deliv him unto the power and author of the governor  20  21 and they ask him  say  master  we know that thou sayest and teachest right  neither acceptest thou the person of ani  but teachest the way of god truli  20  22 is it law for us to give tribut unto caesar  or no  20  23 but he perceiv their crafti  and said unto them  whi tempt ye me

thing which be god  s  20  26 and they could not take hold of his word befor the peopl  and they marvel at his answer  and held their peac  20  27 then came to him certain of the sadduce  which deni that there is ani resurrect  and they ask him  20  28 say  master  mose wrote unto us  if ani man  s brother die  have a wife  and he die without children  that his brother should take his wife  and

the third took her  and in like manner the seven also  and they left no children  and die  20  32 last of all the woman die also  20  33 therefor in the resurrect whose wife of them is she  for seven had her to wife  20  34 and jesus answer said unto them  the children of this world marri  and are given in marriag  20  35 but they which shall be account worthi to obtain that world  and the resurrect from the dead  neither marri  nor are given in marriag  20  36 neither can they die ani more  for they are equal unto the angel  and are the children of god  be the children of the resurrect  20  37 now that the dead are rais  even mose shew at the bush  when he calleth the lord the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  20  38 for he is not a god of the dead  but of

them  how say they that christ is david  s son  20  42 and david himself saith in the book of psalm  the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  20  43 till i make thine enemi thi footstool  20  44 david therefor calleth him lord  how is he then his son  20  45 then in the audienc of all the peopl he said unto his discipl  20  46 bewar of the scribe  which desir to walk in long robe  and

1 and he look up  and saw the rich men cast their gift into the treasuri  21  2 and he saw also a certain poor widow cast in thither two mite  21  3 and he said  of a truth i say unto you  that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all  21  4 for all these have of their abund cast in unto the offer of god  but she of her penuri hath cast in all the live that she had  21  5 and as some spake

onli a stranger in jerusalem  and hast not known the thing which are come to pass there in these day  24  19 and he said unto them  what thing  and they said unto him  concern jesus of nazareth  which was a prophet mighti in deed and word befor god and all the peopl  24  20 and how the chief priest and our ruler deliv him to be condemn to death  and have crucifi him  24  21 but we trust that it had been he which should have redeem israel  and besid all this  to day is the third day sinc these thing were done  24  22 yea  and certain women also of our compani made us astonish  which were earli at the sepulchr  24  23 and when they found not his bodi  they came  say  that they had also seen a vision of angel  which said that he was aliv  24  24 and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchr  and found it even so as the women had said  but him they saw not  24  25 then he said unto them  o fool  and slow of heart to believ all that the prophet have spoken  24  26 ought not christ to have suffer these thing  and to enter into his glori  24  27 and begin at mose and all the prophet  he expound unto them in all the scriptur the thing concern himself  24  28 and they drew nigh unto the villag  whither they went  and he made as though he would have gone further  24  29 but they constrain him  say  abid with us  for it is toward even  and the day is far spent  and he went in to tarri with them  24  30 and it came to pass  as he sat at meat with them  he took bread  and bless it  and brake  and gave to them  24  31 and their eye were open  and they knew him  and he vanish out of their sight  24  32 and they said one to anoth  did not our heart burn within us  while he talk with us by the way  and while he open to us the scriptur  24  33 and they rose up the same hour  and return to jerusalem  and found the eleven gather togeth  and them that were with them  24  34 say  the lord is risen inde  and hath appear to simon  24  35 and they told what thing were done in the way  and how he was known of them in break of bread  24  36 and as they thus spake  jesus himself stood in the midst of them  and saith unto them  peac be unto you  24  37 but they were terrifi and affright  and suppos that they had seen a spirit  24  38 and he said unto them  whi are ye troubl  and whi do thought aris in your heart  24  39 behold my hand and my feet  that it is i myself  handl me  and see  for a spirit hath not flesh and bone  as ye see me have  24  40 and when he had thus spoken  he shew them his hand and his feet  24  41 and while they yet believ not for joy  and wonder  he said unto them  have ye here ani meat  24  42 and they gave him a piec of a broil fish  and of an honeycomb  24  43 and he took it  and did eat befor them  24  44 and he said unto them  these are the word which i spake unto you  while i was yet with you  that all thing must be fulfil  which were written in the law of mose  and in the prophet  and in the psalm  concern me  24  45 then open he their understand  that they might understand the scriptur  24  46 and said unto them  thus it is written  and thus it behov christ to suffer  and to rise from the dead the third day  24  47 and that repent and remiss of sin should be preach in his name among all nation  begin at jerusalem  24  48 and ye are wit of these thing  24  49 and  behold  i send the promis of my father upon you  but tarri ye in the citi of jerusalem  until ye be endu with power from on high  24  50 and he led them out as far as to bethani  and he lift up his hand  and bless them  24  51 and it came to pass  while he bless them  he was part from them  and carri up into heaven  24  52 and they worship him  and return to jerusalem with great joy  24  53 and were continu in the templ  prais and bless god  amen  the gospel accord to saint john 1  1 in the begin was the word  and the word was with god  and the word was god  1  2 the same was in the begin with god  1  3 all thing were made by him  and without him was not ani thing made that was made  1  4 in him was life  and the life was the light of men  1  5 and the light shineth in dark  and the dark comprehend it not  1  6 there was a man sent from god  whose name was john  1  7 the same came for a wit  to bear wit of the light  that all men through him might believ  1  8 he was not that light  but was sent to bear wit of that light  1  9 that was the true light  which lighteth everi man that cometh into the world  1  10 he was in the world  and the world was made by him  and the world knew him not  1  11 he came unto his own  and his own receiv him not  1  12 but as mani as receiv him  to them gave he power to becom the son of god  even to them that believ on his name  1  13 which were born  not of blood  nor of the will of the flesh  nor of the will of man  but of god  1  14 and the word was made flesh  and dwelt among us   and we beheld his glori  the glori as of the onli begotten of the father  full of grace and truth  1  15 john bare wit of him  and cri  say  this was he of whom i spake  he that cometh after me is prefer befor me  for he was befor me  1  16 and of his ful have all we receiv  and grace for grace  1  17 for the law was given by mose  but grace and truth came by jesus christ  1  18 no man hath seen god at ani time  the onli begotten son  which is in the bosom of the father  he hath declar him  1  19 and this is the record of john  when the jew sent priest and levit from jerusalem to ask him  who art thou  1  20 and he confess  and deni not  but confess  i am not the christ  1  21 and they ask him  what then  art thou elia  and he saith  i am not  art thou that prophet  and he answer  no  1  22 then said they unto him  who art thou  that we may give an answer to them that sent us  what sayest

1  29 the next day john seeth jesus come unto him  and saith  behold the lamb of god  which taketh away the sin of the world  1  30 this is he of whom i said  after me cometh a man which is prefer befor me  for he was befor me  1  31 and i knew him not  but that he should be made manifest to israel  therefor am i come baptiz with water  1  32 and john bare record  say  i saw the spirit descend from heaven like a dove  and it abod upon him  1  33 and i knew him not  but he that sent me to baptiz with water  the same said unto me  upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend  and remain on him  the same is he which baptizeth with the holi ghost  1  34 and i saw  and bare record that this is the son of god  1  35 again the next day after john stood  and two of his discipl  1  36 and look upon jesus as he walk  he saith  behold the lamb of god  1  37 and the two discipl heard him speak  and they follow jesus  1  38 then jesus turn  and saw them follow  and saith unto them  what seek ye  they said unto him  rabbi   which is to say  be interpret  master  where dwellest thou  1  39 he saith unto them  come and see  they came and saw where he dwelt  and abod with him that day  for it was about the tenth hour  1  40 one of the two which heard john speak  and follow him  was andrew  simon peter  s brother  1  41 he first findeth his own brother simon  and saith unto him  we have found the messia  which is  be interpret  the christ  1  42 and he brought him to jesus  and when jesus beheld him  he said  thou art simon the son of jona  thou shalt be call cepha  which is by

philip findeth nathanael  and saith unto him  we have found him  of whom mose in the law  and the prophet  did write  jesus of nazareth  the son of joseph  1  46 and nathanael said unto him  can there ani good thing come out of nazareth  philip saith unto him  come and see  1  47 jesus saw nathanael come to him  and saith of him  behold an israelit inde  in whom is no guil  1  48 nathanael saith

the son of god  thou art the king of israel  1  50 jesus answer and said unto him  becaus i said unto thee  i saw thee under the fig tree  believest thou  thou shalt see greater thing than these  1  51 and he saith unto him  verili  verili  i say unto you  hereaft ye shall see heaven open  and the angel of god ascend and descend upon the son of man  2  1 and the third day there was a marriag in cana of galile  and the mother of jesus was there  2  2 and both jesus was call  and his discipl  to the marriag  2  3 and when they want wine  the mother of jesus saith unto him  they have no wine  2  4 jesus saith unto her  woman  what have i to do with thee  mine hour is not yet come  2  5 his mother saith unto the servant  whatsoev he saith unto you  do it  2  6 and there were set there six waterpot of stone  after the manner of the purifi of the jew  contain two or three firkin apiec  2  7 jesus saith unto them  fill the waterpot with water  and they fill them up to the brim  2  8 and he saith unto them  draw out now  and bear unto the governor of the feast  and they bare it  2  9 when the ruler of the feast had tast the water that was made wine  and knew not whenc it was   but the servant which drew the water knew  the governor of the feast call the bridegroom  2  10 and saith unto him  everi man at the begin doth set forth good wine  and when men have well drunk  then that which is wors  but thou hast kept the good wine until now  2  11 this begin of miracl did jesus in cana of galile  and manifest forth his glori  and his discipl believ on him  2  12 after this he went down to capernaum  he  and his mother  and his brethren  and his discipl  and they continu there not mani day  2  13 and the jew  passov was at hand  and jesus went up to jerusalem  2  14 and found in the templ those that sold oxen and sheep and dove  and the changer of money sit  2  15 and when he had made a scourg of small cord  he drove them all out of the templ  and the sheep  and the oxen  and pour out the changer  money  and overthrew the tabl  2  16 and said unto them that sold dove  take these thing henc  make not my father  s hous an hous of merchandis  2  17 and his discipl rememb that it was written  the zeal of thine hous hath eaten me up  2  18 then answer the jew and said unto him  what sign shewest thou unto us  see that thou doest these thing  2  19 jesus answer and said unto them  destroy this templ  and in three day i will rais it up  2  20 then said the jew  forti and six year was this templ in build  and wilt thou rear it up in three day  2  21 but he spake of the templ of his bodi  2  22 when therefor he was risen from the dead  his discipl rememb that he had said this unto them  and they believ the scriptur  and the word which jesus had said  2  23 now when he was in jerusalem at the passov  in the feast day  mani believ in his name  when they saw the miracl which he did  2  24 but jesus did not commit himself unto them  becaus he knew all men  2  25 and need not that ani should testifi of man  for he knew what was in man  3  1 there was a man of the pharise  name nicodemus  a ruler of the jew  3  2 the same came to jesus by night  and said unto him  rabbi  we know that thou art a teacher come from god  for no man can do these miracl that thou doest  except god be with him  3  3 jesus answer and said unto him  verili  verili  i say unto thee  except a man be born again  he cannot see the kingdom of god  3  4 nicodemus saith unto him  how can a man be born when he is old  can he enter the second time into his mother  s womb  and be born  3  5 jesus answer  verili  verili  i say unto thee  except a man be born of water and of the spirit  he cannot enter into the kingdom of god  3  6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh  and that which is born of the spirit is spirit  3  7 marvel not that i said unto thee  ye must be born again  3  8 the wind bloweth where it listeth  and thou hearest the sound thereof  but canst not tell whenc it cometh  and whither it goeth  so is everi one that is born of the spirit  3  9 nicodemus answer and said unto him  how can these thing be  3  10 jesus answer and said unto him  art thou a master of israel  and knowest not these thing  3  11 verili  verili  i say unto thee  we speak that we do know  and testifi that we have seen  and ye receiv not our wit  3  12 if i have told you earth thing  and ye believ not  how shall ye believ  if i tell you of heaven thing  3  13 and no man hath ascend up to heaven  but he that came down from heaven  even the son of man which is in heaven  3  14 and as mose lift up the serpent in the wilder  even so must the son of man be lift up  3  15 that whosoev believeth in him should not perish  but have etern life  3  16 for god so love the world  that he gave his onli begotten son  that whosoev believeth in him should not perish  but have everlast life  3  17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world  but that the world through him might be save  3  18 he that believeth on him is not condemn  but he that believeth not is condemn alreadi  becaus he hath not believ in the name of the onli begotten son of god  3  19 and this is the condemn  that light is come into the world  and men love dark rather than light  becaus their deed were evil  3  20 for everi one that doeth evil hateth the light  neither cometh to the light  lest his deed should be reprov  3  21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light  that his deed may be made manifest  that they are wrought in god  3  22 after these thing came jesus and his discipl into the land of judaea  and there he tarri with them  and baptiz  3  23 and john also was baptiz in aenon near to salim  becaus there was much water there  and they came  and were baptiz  3  24 for john was not yet cast into prison  3  25 then there aros a question between some of john  s discipl and the jew about purifi  3  26 and they came unto john  and said unto him  rabbi  he that was with thee beyond jordan  to whom thou barest wit  behold  the same baptizeth  and all men come to him  3  27 john answer and said  a man can receiv noth  except it be given him from heaven  3  28 ye yourselv bear me wit  that i said  i am not the christ  but that i am sent befor him  3  29 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom  but the friend of the bridegroom  which standeth and heareth him  rejoiceth great becaus of the bridegroom  s voic  this my joy therefor is fulfil  3  30 he must increas  but i must decreas  3  31 he that cometh from abov is abov all  he that is of the earth is earth  and speaketh of the earth  he that cometh from heaven is abov all  3  32 and what he hath seen and heard  that he testifieth  and no man receiveth his testimoni  3  33 he that hath receiv his testimoni hath set to his seal that god is true  3  34 for he whom god hath sent speaketh the word of god  for god giveth not the spirit by measur unto him  3  35 the father loveth the son  and hath given all thing into his hand  3  36 he that believeth on the son hath everlast life  and he that believeth not the son shall not see life  but the wrath of god abideth on him  4  1 when therefor the lord knew how the pharise had heard that jesus made and baptiz more discipl than john  4  2  though jesus himself baptiz not  but his discipl  4  3 he left judaea  and depart again into galile  4  4 and he must need go through samaria  4  5 then cometh he to a citi of samaria  which is call sychar  near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph  4  6 now jacob  s well was there  jesus therefor  be weari with his journey  sat thus on the well  and it was about the sixth hour  4  7 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water  jesus saith unto her  give me to drink  4  8  for his discipl were gone away unto the citi to buy meat  4  9 then saith the woman of samaria unto him  how is it that thou  be a jew  askest drink of me  which am a woman of samaria  for the jew have no deal with the samaritan  4  10 jesus answer and said unto her  if thou knewest the gift of god  and who it is that saith to thee  give me to drink  thou wouldest have ask of him  and he would have given thee live water  4  11 the woman saith unto him  sir  thou hast noth to draw with  and the well is deep  from whenc then hast thou that live water  4  12 art thou greater than our father jacob  which gave us the well  and drank thereof himself  and his children  and his cattl  4  13 jesus answer and said unto her  whosoev drinketh of this water shall thirst again  4  14 but whosoev drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst  but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water spring up into everlast life  4  15 the woman saith unto him  sir  give me this water  that i thirst not  neither come hither to draw  4  16 jesus saith unto her  go  call thi husband  and come hither  4  17 the woman answer and said  i have no husband  jesus said unto her  thou hast well said  i have no husband  4  18 for thou hast had five husband  and he whom thou now hast is not thi husband  in that saidst thou truli  4  19 the woman saith unto him  sir  i perceiv that thou art a prophet  4  20 our father worship in this mountain  and ye say  that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship  4  21 jesus saith unto her  woman  believ me  the hour cometh  when ye shall neither in this mountain  nor yet at jerusalem  worship the father  4  22 ye worship ye know not what  we know what we worship  for salvat is of the jew  4  23 but the hour cometh  and now is  when the true worshipp shall worship the father in spirit and in truth  for the father seeketh such to worship him  4  24 god is a spirit  and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth  4  25 the woman saith unto him  i know that messia cometh  which is call christ  when he is come  he will tell us all thing  4  26 jesus saith unto her  i that speak unto thee am he  4  27 and upon this came his discipl  and marvel that he talk with the woman  yet no man said  what seekest thou  or  whi talkest thou with her  4  28 the woman then left her waterpot  and went her way into the citi  and saith to the men  4  29 come  see a man  which told me all thing that ever i did  is not this the christ  4  30 then they went out of the citi  and came unto him  4  31 in the mean while his discipl pray him  say  master  eat  4  32 but he said unto them  i have meat to eat that ye know not of  4  33 therefor said the discipl one to anoth  hath ani man brought him ought to eat  4  34 jesus saith unto them  my meat is to do the will of him that sent me  and to finish his work  4  35 say not ye  there are yet four month  and then cometh harvest  behold  i say unto you  lift up your eye  and look on the field  for they are white alreadi to harvest  4  36 and he that reapeth receiveth wage  and gathereth fruit unto life etern  that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoic togeth  4  37 and herein is that say true  one soweth  and anoth reapeth  4  38 i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestow no labour  other men labour  and ye are enter into their labour  4  39 and mani of the samaritan of that citi believ on him for the say of the woman  which testifi  he told me all that ever i did  4  40 so when the samaritan were come unto him  they besought him that he would tarri with them  and he abod there two day  4  41 and mani more believ becaus of his own word  4  42 and said unto the woman  now we believ  not becaus of thi say  for we have heard him ourselv  and know that this is inde the christ  the saviour of the world  4  43 now after two day he depart thenc  and went into galile  4  44 for jesus himself testifi  that a prophet hath no honour in his own countri  4  45 then when he was come into galile  the galilaean receiv him  have seen all the thing that he did at jerusalem at the feast  for they also went unto the feast  4  46 so jesus came again into cana of galile  where he made the water wine  and there was a certain nobleman  whose son was sick at capernaum  4  47 when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galile  he went unto him  and besought him that he would come down  and heal his son  for he was at the point of death  4  48 then said jesus unto him  except ye see sign and wonder  ye will not believ  4  49 the nobleman saith unto him  sir  come down ere my child die  4  50 jesus saith unto him  go thi way  thi son liveth  and the man believ the word that jesus had spoken unto him  and he went his way  4  51 and as he was now go down  his servant met him  and told him  say  thi son liveth  4  52 then enquir he of them the hour when he began to amend  and they said unto him  yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him  4  53 so the father knew that it was at the same hour  in the which jesus said unto him  thi son liveth  and himself believ  and his whole hous  4  54 this is again the second miracl that jesus did  when he was come out of judaea into galile  5  1 after this there was a feast of the jew  and jesus went up to jerusalem  5  2 now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool  which is call in the hebrew tongu bethesda  have five porch  5  3 in these lay a great multitud of impot folk  of blind  halt  wither  wait for the move of the water  5  4 for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool  and troubl the water  whosoev then first after the troubl of the water step in was made whole of whatsoev diseas he had  5  5 and a certain man was there  which had an infirm thirti and eight year  5  6 when jesus saw him lie  and knew that he had been now a long time in that case  he saith unto him  wilt thou be made whole  5  7 the impot man answer him  sir  i have no man  when the water is troubl  to put me into the pool  but while i am come  anoth steppeth down befor me  5  8 jesus saith unto him  rise  take up thi bed  and walk  5  9 and immedi the man was made whole  and took up his bed  and walk  and on the same day was the sabbath  5  10 the jew therefor said unto him that was cure  it is the sabbath day  it is not law for thee to carri thi bed  5  11 he answer them  he that made me whole  the same said unto me  take up thi bed  and walk  5  12 then ask they him  what man is that which said unto thee  take up thi bed  and walk  5  13 and he that was heal wist not who it was  for jesus had convey himself away  a multitud be in that place  5  14 afterward jesus findeth him in the templ  and said unto him  behold  thou art made whole  sin no more  lest a wors thing come unto thee  5  15 the man depart  and told the jew that it was jesus  which had made him whole  5  16 and therefor did the jew persecut jesus  and sought to slay him  becaus he had done these thing on the sabbath day  5  17 but jesus answer them  my father worketh hitherto  and i work  5  18 therefor the jew sought the more to kill him  becaus he not onli had broken the sabbath  but said also that god was his father  make himself equal with god  5  19 then answer jesus and said unto them  verili  verili  i say unto you  the son can do noth of himself  but what he seeth the father do  for what thing soever he doeth  these also doeth the son likewis  5  20 for the father loveth the son  and sheweth him all thing that himself doeth  and he will shew him greater work than these  that ye may marvel  5  21 for as the father raiseth up the dead  and quickeneth them  even so the son quickeneth whom he will  5  22 for the father judgeth no man  but hath commit all judgment unto the son  5  23 that all men should honour the son  even as they honour the father  he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him  5  24 verili  verili  i say unto you  he that heareth my word  and believeth on him that sent me  hath everlast life  and shall not come into condemn  but is pass from death unto life  5  25 verili  verili  i say unto you  the hour is come  and now is  when the dead shall hear the voic of the son of god  and they that hear shall live  5  26 for as the father hath life in himself  so hath he given to the son to have life in himself  5  27 and hath given him author to execut judgment also  becaus he is the son of man  5  28 marvel not at this  for the hour is come  in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voic  5  29 and shall come forth  they that have done good  unto the resurrect of life  and they that have done evil  unto the resurrect of damnat  5  30 i can of mine own self do noth  as i hear  i judg  and my judgment is just  becaus i seek not mine own will  but the will of the father which hath sent me  5  31 if i bear wit of myself  my wit is not true  5  32 there is anoth that beareth wit of me  and i know that the wit which he witnesseth of me is true  5  33 ye sent unto john  and he bare wit unto the truth  5  34 but i receiv not testimoni from man  but these thing i say  that ye might be save  5  35 he was a burn and a shine light  and ye were will for a season to rejoic in his light  5  36 but i have greater wit than that of john  for the work which the father hath given me to finish  the same work that i do  bear wit of me  that the father hath sent me  5  37 and the father himself  which hath sent me  hath born wit of me  ye have neither heard his voic at ani time  nor seen his shape  5  38 and ye have not his word abid in you  for whom he hath sent  him ye believ not  5  39 search the scriptur  for in them ye think ye have etern life  and they are they which testifi of me  5  40 and ye will not come to me  that ye might have life  5  41 i receiv not honour from men  5  42 but i know you  that ye have not the love of god in you  5  43 i am come in my father  s name  and ye receiv me not  if anoth shall come in his own name  him ye will receiv  5  44 how can ye believ  which receiv honour one of anoth  and seek not the honour that cometh from god onli  5  45 do not think that i will accus you to the father  there is one that accuseth you  even mose  in whom ye trust  5  46 for had ye believ mose  ye would have believ me  for he wrote of me  5  47 but if ye believ not his write  how shall ye believ my word  6  1 after these thing jesus went over the sea of galile  which is the sea of tiberia  6  2 and a great multitud follow him  becaus they saw his miracl which he did on them that were diseas  6  3 and jesus went up into a mountain  and there he sat with his discipl  6  4 and the passov  a feast of the jew  was nigh  6  5 when jesus then lift up his eye  and saw a great compani come unto him  he saith unto philip  whenc shall we buy bread  that these may eat  6  6 and this he said to prove him  for he himself knew what he would do  6  7 philip answer him  two hundr pennyworth of bread is not suffici for them  that everi one of them may take a littl  6  8 one of his discipl  andrew  simon peter  s brother  saith unto him  6  9 there is a lad here  which hath five barley loav  and two small fish  but what are they among so mani  6  10 and jesus said  make the men sit down  now there was much grass in the place  so the men sat down  in number about five thousand  6  11 and jesus took the loav  and when he had given thank  he distribut to the discipl  and the discipl to them that were set down  and likewis of the fish as much as they would  6  12 when they were fill  he said unto his discipl  gather up the fragment that remain  that noth be lost  6  13 therefor they gather them togeth  and fill twelv basket with the fragment of the five barley loav  which remain over and abov unto them that had eaten  6  14 then those men  when they had seen the miracl that jesus did  said  this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world  6  15 when jesus therefor perceiv that they would come and take him by forc  to make him a king  he depart again into a mountain himself alon  6  16 and when even was now come  his discipl went down unto the sea  6  17 and enter into a ship  and went over the sea toward capernaum  and it was now dark  and jesus was not come to them  6  18 and the sea aros by reason of a great wind that blew  6  19 so when they had row about five and twenti or thirti furlong  they see jesus walk on the sea  and draw nigh unto the ship  and they were afraid  6  20 but he saith unto them  it is i  be not afraid  6  21 then they will receiv him into the ship  and immedi the ship was at the land whither they went  6  22 the day follow  when the peopl which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there  save that one whereinto his discipl were enter  and that jesus went not with his discipl into the boat  but that his discipl were gone away alon  6  23  howbeit there came other boat from tiberia nigh unto the place where they did eat bread  after that the lord had given thank  6  24 when the peopl therefor saw that jesus was not there  neither his discipl  they also took ship  and came to capernaum  seek for jesus  6  25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea  they said unto him  rabbi  when camest thou hither  6  26 jesus answer them and said  verili  verili  i say unto you  ye seek me  not becaus ye saw the miracl  but becaus ye did eat of the loav  and were fill  6  27 labour not for the meat which perisheth  but for that meat which endureth unto everlast life  which the son of man shall give unto you  for him hath god the father seal  6  28 then said they unto him  what shall we do  that we might work the work of god  6  29 jesus answer and said unto them  this is the work of god  that ye believ on him whom he hath sent  6  30 they said therefor unto him  what sign shewest thou then  that we may see  and believ thee  what dost thou work  6  31 our father did eat manna in the desert  as it is written  he gave them bread from heaven to eat  6  32 then jesus said unto them  verili  verili  i say unto you  mose gave you not that bread from heaven  but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven  6  33 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven  and giveth life unto the world  6  34 then said they unto him  lord  evermor give us this bread  6  35 and jesus said unto them  i am the bread of life  he that cometh to me shall never hunger  and he that believeth on me shall never thirst  6  36 but i said unto you  that ye also have seen me  and believ not  6  37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me  and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  6  38 for i came down from heaven  not to do mine own will  but the will of him that sent me  6  39 and this is the father  s will which hath sent me  that of all which he hath given me i should lose noth  but should rais it up again at the last day  6  40 and this is the will of him that sent me  that everi one which seeth the son  and believeth on him  may have everlast life  and i will rais him up at the last day  6  41 the jew then murmur at him  becaus he said  i am the bread which came down from heaven  6  42 and they said  is not this jesus  the son of joseph  whose father and mother we know  how is it then that he saith  i came down from heaven  6  43 jesus therefor answer and said unto them  murmur not among yourselv  6  44 no man can come to me  except the father which hath sent me draw him  and i will rais him up at the last day  6  45 it is written in the prophet  and they shall be all taught of god  everi man therefor that hath heard  and hath learn of the father  cometh unto me  6  46 not that ani man hath seen the father  save he which is of god  he hath seen the father  6  47 verili  verili  i say unto you  he that believeth on me hath everlast life  6  48 i am that bread of life  6  49 your father did eat manna in the wilder  and are dead  6  50 this is the bread which cometh down from heaven  that a man may eat thereof  and not die  6  51 i am the live bread which came down from heaven  if ani man eat of this bread  he shall live for ever  and the bread that i will give is my flesh  which i will give for the life of the world  6  52 the jew therefor strove among themselv  say  how can this man give us his flesh to eat  6  53 then jesus said unto them  verili  verili  i say unto you  except ye eat the flesh of the son of man  and drink his blood  ye have no life in you  6  54 whoso eateth my flesh  and drinketh my blood  hath etern life  and i will rais him up at the last day  6  55 for my flesh is meat inde  and my blood is drink inde  6  56 he that eateth my flesh  and drinketh my blood  dwelleth in me  and i in him  6  57 as the live father hath sent me  and i live by the father  so he that eateth me  even he shall live by me  6  58 this is that bread which came down from heaven  not as your father did eat manna  and are dead  he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever  6  59 these thing said he in the synagogu  as he taught in capernaum  6  60 mani therefor of his discipl  when they had heard this  said  this is an hard say  who can hear it  6  61 when jesus knew in himself that his discipl murmur at it  he said unto them  doth this offend you  6  62 what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was befor  6  63 it is the spirit that quickeneth  the flesh profiteth noth  the word that i speak unto you  they are spirit  and they are life  6  64 but there are some of you that believ not  for jesus knew from the begin who they were that believ not  and who should betray him  6  65 and he said  therefor said i unto you  that no man can come unto me  except it were given unto him of my father  6  66 from that time mani of his discipl went back  and walk no more with him  6  67 then said jesus unto the twelv  will ye also go away  6  68 then simon peter answer him  lord  to whom shall we go  thou hast the word of etern life  6  69 and we believ and are sure that thou art that christ  the son of the live god  6  70 jesus answer them  have not i chosen you twelv  and one of you is a devil  6  71 he spake of juda iscariot the son of simon  for he it was that should betray him  be one of the twelv  7  1 after these thing jesus walk in galile  for he would not walk in jewri  becaus the jew sought to kill him  7  2 now the jew  s feast of tabernacl was at hand  7  3 his brethren therefor said unto him  depart henc  and go into judaea  that thi discipl also may see the work that thou doest  7  4 for there is no man that doeth ani thing in secret  and he himself seeketh to be known open  if thou do these thing  shew thyself to the world  7  5 for neither did his brethren believ in him  7  6 then jesus said unto them  my time is not yet come  but your time is alway readi  7  7 the world cannot hate you  but me it hateth  becaus i testifi of it  that the work thereof are evil  7  8 go ye up unto this feast  i go not up yet unto this feast  for my time is not yet full come  7  9 when he had said these word unto them  he abod still in galile  7  10 but when his brethren were gone up  then went he also up unto the feast  not open  but as it were in secret  7  11 then the jew sought him at the feast  and said  where is he  7  12 and there was much murmur among the peopl concern him  for some said  he is a good man  other said  nay  but he deceiveth the peopl  7  13 howbeit no man spake open of him for fear of the jew  7  14 now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the templ  and taught  7  15 and the jew marvel  say  how knoweth this man letter  have never learn  7  16 jesus answer them  and said  my doctrin is not mine  but his that sent me  7  17 if ani man will do his will  he shall know of the doctrin  whether it be of god  or whether i speak of myself  7  18 he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glori  but he that seeketh his glori that sent him  the same is true  and no unright is in him  7  19 did not mose give you the law  and yet none of you keepeth the law  whi go ye about to kill me  7  20 the peopl answer and said  thou hast a devil  who goeth about to kill thee  7  21 jesus answer and said unto them  i have done one work  and ye all marvel  7  22 mose therefor gave unto you circumcis   not becaus it is of mose  but of the father  and ye on the sabbath day circumcis a man  7  23 if a man on the sabbath day receiv circumcis  that the law of mose should not be broken  are ye angri at me  becaus i have made a man everi whit whole on the sabbath day  7  24 judg not accord to the appear  but judg righteous judgment  7  25 then said some of them of jerusalem  is not this he  whom they seek to kill  7  26 but  lo  he speaketh bold  and they say noth unto him  do the ruler know inde that this is the veri christ  7  27 howbeit we know this man whenc he is  but when christ cometh  no man knoweth whenc he is  7  28 then cri jesus in the templ as he taught  say  ye both know me  and ye know whenc i am  and i am not come of myself  but he that sent me is true  whom ye know not  7  29 but i know him  for i am from him  and he hath sent me  7  30 then they sought to take him  but no man laid hand on him  becaus his hour was not yet come  7  31 and mani of the peopl believ on him  and said  when christ cometh  will he do more miracl than these which this man hath done  7  32 the pharise heard that the peopl murmur such thing concern him  and the pharise and the chief priest sent offic to take him  7  33 then said jesus unto them  yet a littl while am i with you  and then i go unto him that sent me  7  34 ye shall seek me  and shall not find me  and where i am  thither ye cannot come  7  35 then said the jew among themselv  whither will he go  that we shall not find him  will he go unto the dispers among the gentil  and teach the gentil  7  36 what manner of say is this that he said  ye shall seek me  and shall not find me  and where i am  thither ye cannot come  7  37 in the last day  that great day of the feast  jesus stood and cri  say  if ani man thirst  let him come unto me  and drink  7  38 he that believeth on me  as the scriptur hath said  out of his belli shall flow river of live water  7  39  but this spake he of the spirit  which they that believ on him should receiv  for the holi ghost was not yet given  becaus that jesus was not yet glorifi  7  40 mani of the peopl therefor  when they heard this say  said  of a truth this is the prophet  7  41 other said  this is the christ  but some said  shall christ come out of galile  7  42 hath not the scriptur said  that christ cometh of the seed of david  and out of the town of bethlehem  where david was  7  43 so there was a divis among the peopl becaus of him  7  44 and some of them would have taken him  but no man laid hand on him  7  45 then came the offic to the chief priest and pharise  and they said unto them  whi have ye not brought him  7  46 the offic answer  never man spake like this man  7  47 then answer them the pharise  are ye also deceiv  7  48 have ani of the ruler or of the pharise believ on him  7  49 but this peopl who knoweth not the law are curs  7  50 nicodemus saith unto them   he that came to jesus by night  be one of them  7  51 doth our law judg ani man  befor it hear him  and know what he doeth  7  52 they answer and said unto him  art thou also of galile  search  and look  for out of galile ariseth no prophet  7  53 and everi man went unto his own hous  8  1 jesus went unto the mount of oliv  8  2 and earli in the morn he came again into the templ  and all the peopl came unto him  and he sat down  and taught them  8  3 and the scribe and pharise brought unto him a woman taken in adulteri  and when they had set her in the midst  8  4 they say unto him  master  this woman was taken in adulteri  in the veri act  8  5 now mose in the law command us  that such should be stone  but what sayest thou  8  6 this they said  tempt him  that they might have to accus him  but jesus stoop down  and with his finger wrote on the ground  as though he heard them not  8  7 so when they continu ask him  he lift up himself  and said unto them  he that is without sin among you  let him first cast a stone at her  8  8 and again he stoop down  and wrote on the ground  8  9 and they which heard it  be convict by their own conscienc  went out one by one  begin at the eldest  even unto the last  and jesus was left alon  and the woman stand in the midst  8  10 when jesus had lift up himself  and saw none but the woman  he said unto her  woman  where are those thine accus  hath no man condemn thee  8  11 she said  no man  lord  and jesus said unto her  neither do i condemn thee  go  and sin no more  8  12 then spake jesus again unto them  say  i am the light of the world  he that followeth me shall not walk in dark  but shall have the light of life  8  13 the pharise therefor said unto him  thou bearest record of thyself  thi record is not true  8  14 jesus answer and said unto them  though i bear record of myself  yet my record is true  for i know whenc i came  and whither i go  but ye cannot tell whenc i come  and whither i go  8  15 ye judg after the flesh  i judg no man  8  16 and yet if i judg  my judgment is true  for i am not alon  but i and the father that sent me  8  17 it is also written in your law  that the testimoni of two men is true  8  18 i am one that bear wit of myself  and the father that sent me beareth wit of me  8  19 then said they unto him  where is thi father  jesus answer  ye neither know me  nor my father  if ye had known me  ye should have known my father also  8  20 these word spake jesus in the treasuri  as he taught in the templ  and no man laid hand on him  for his hour was not yet come  8  21 then said jesus again unto them  i go my way  and ye shall seek me  and shall die in your sin  whither i go  ye cannot come  8  22 then said the jew  will he kill himself  becaus he saith  whither i go  ye cannot come  8  23 and he said unto them  ye are from beneath  i am from abov  ye are of this world  i am not of this world  8  24 i said therefor unto you  that ye shall die in your sin  for if ye believ not that i am he  ye shall die in your sin  8  25 then said they unto him  who art thou  and jesus saith unto them  even the same that i said unto you from the begin  8  26 i have mani thing to say and to judg of you  but he that sent me is true  and i speak to the world those thing which i have heard of him  8  27 they understood not that he spake to them of the father  8  28 then said jesus unto them  when ye have lift up the son of man  then shall ye know that i am he  and that i do noth of myself  but as my father hath taught me  i speak these thing  8  29 and he that sent me is with me  the father hath not left me alon  for i do alway those thing that pleas him  8  30 as he spake these word  mani believ on him  8  31 then said jesus to those jew which believ on him  if ye continu in my word  then are ye my discipl inde  8  32 and ye shall know the truth  and the truth shall make you free  8  33 they answer him  we be abraham  s seed  and were never in bondag to ani man  how sayest thou  ye shall be made free  8  34 jesus answer them  verili  verili  i say unto you  whosoev committeth sin is the servant of sin  8  35 and the servant abideth not in the hous for ever  but the son abideth ever  8  36 if the son therefor shall make you free  ye shall be free inde  8  37 i know that ye are abraham  s seed  but ye seek to kill me  becaus my word hath no place in you  8  38 i speak that which i have seen with my father  and ye do that which ye have seen with your father  8  39 they answer and said unto him  abraham is our father  jesus saith unto them  if ye were abraham  s children  ye would do the work of abraham  8  40 but now ye seek to kill me  a man that hath told you the truth  which i have heard of god  this did not abraham  8  41 ye do the deed of your father  then said they to him  we be not born of fornic  we have one father  even god  8  42 jesus said unto them  if god were your father  ye would love me  for i proceed forth and came from god  neither came i of myself  but he sent me  8  43 whi do ye not understand my speech  even becaus ye cannot hear my word  8  44 ye are of your father the devil  and the lust of your father ye will do  he was a murder from the begin  and abod not in the truth  becaus there is no truth in him  when he speaketh a lie  he speaketh of his own  for he is a liar  and the father of it  8  45 and becaus i tell you the truth  ye believ me not  8  46 which of you convinceth me of sin  and if i say the truth  whi do ye not believ me  8  47 he that is of god heareth god  s word  ye therefor hear them not  becaus ye are not of god  8  48 then answer the jew  and said unto him  say we not well that thou art a samaritan  and hast a devil  8  49 jesus answer  i have not a devil  but i honour my father  and ye do dishonour me  8  50 and i seek not mine own glori  there is one that seeketh and judgeth  8  51 verili  verili  i say unto you  if a man keep my say  he shall never see death  8  52 then said the jew unto him  now we know that thou hast a devil  abraham is dead  and the prophet  and thou sayest  if a man keep my say  he shall never tast of death  8  53 art thou greater than our father abraham  which is dead  and the prophet are dead  whom makest thou thyself  8  54 jesus answer  if i honour myself  my honour is noth  it is my father that honoureth me  of whom ye say  that he is your god  8  55 yet ye have not known him  but i know him  and if i should say  i know him not  i shall be a liar like unto you  but i know him  and keep his say  8  56 your father abraham rejoic to see my day  and he saw it  and was glad  8  57 then said the jew unto him  thou art not yet fifti year old  and hast thou seen abraham  8  58 jesus said unto them  verili  verili  i say unto you  befor abraham was  i am  8  59 then took they up stone to cast at him  but jesus hid himself  and went out of the templ  go through the midst of them  and so pass by  9  1 and as jesus pass by  he saw a man which was blind from his birth  9  2 and his discipl ask him  say  master  who did sin  this man  or his parent  that he was born blind  9  3 jesus answer  neither hath this man sin  nor his parent  but that the work of god should be made manifest in him  9  4 i must work the work of him that sent me  while it is day  the night cometh  when no man can work  9  5 as long as i am in the world  i am the light of the world  9  6 when he had thus spoken  he spat on the ground  and made clay of the spittl  and he anoint the eye of the blind man with the clay  9  7 and said unto him  go  wash in the pool of siloam   which is by interpret  sent  he went his way therefor  and wash  and came see  9  8 the neighbour therefor  and they which befor had seen him that he was blind  said  is not this he that sat and beg  9  9 some said  this is he  other said  he is like him  but he said  i am he  9  10 therefor said they unto him  how were thine eye open  9  11 he answer and said  a man that is call jesus made clay  and anoint mine eye  and said unto me  go to the pool of siloam  and wash  and i went and wash  and i receiv sight  9  12 then said they unto him  where is he  he said  i know not  9  13 they brought to the pharise him that aforetim was blind  9  14 and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay  and open his eye  9  15 then again the pharise also ask him how he had receiv his sight  he said unto them  he put clay upon mine eye  and i wash  and do see  9  16 therefor said some of the pharise  this man is not of god  becaus he keepeth not the sabbath day  other said  how can a man that is a sinner do such miracl  and there was a divis among them  9  17 they say unto the blind man again  what sayest thou of him  that he hath open thine eye  he said  he is a prophet  9  18 but the jew did not believ concern him  that he had been blind  and receiv his sight  until they call the parent of him that had receiv his sight  9  19 and they ask them  say  is this your son  who ye say was born blind  how then doth he now see  9  20 his parent answer them and said  we know that this is our son  and that he was born blind  9  21 but by what mean he now seeth  we know not  or who hath open his eye  we know not  he is of age  ask him  he shall speak for himself  9  22 these word spake his parent  becaus they fear the jew  for the jew had agre alreadi  that if ani man did confess that he was christ  he should be put out of the synagogu  9  23 therefor said his parent  he is of age  ask him  9  24 then again call they the man that was blind  and said unto him  give god the prais  we know that this man is a sinner  9  25 he answer and said  whether he be a sinner or no  i know not  one thing i know  that  wherea i was blind  now i see  9  26 then said they to him again  what did he to thee  how open he thine eye  9  27 he answer them  i have told you alreadi  and ye did not hear  wherefor would ye hear it again  will ye also be his discipl  9  28 then they revil him  and said  thou art his discipl  but we are mose  discipl  9  29 we know that god spake unto mose  as for this fellow  we know not from whenc he is  9  30 the man answer and said unto them  whi herein is a marvel thing  that ye know not from whenc he is  and yet he hath open mine eye  9  31 now we know that god heareth not sinner  but if ani man be a worshipp of god  and doeth his will  him he heareth  9  32 sinc the world began was it not heard that ani man open the eye of one that was born blind  9  33 if this man were not of god  he could do noth  9  34 they answer and said unto him  thou wast altogeth born in sin  and dost thou teach us  and they cast him out  9  35 jesus heard that they had cast him out  and when he had found him  he said unto him  dost thou believ on the son of god  9  36 he answer and said  who is he  lord  that i might believ on him  9  37 and jesus said unto him  thou hast both seen him  and it is he that talketh with thee  9  38 and he said  lord  i believ  and he worship him  9  39 and jesus said  for judgment i am come into this world  that they which see not might see  and that they which see might be made blind  9  40 and some of the pharise which were with him heard these word  and said unto him  are we blind also  9  41 jesus said unto them  if ye were blind  ye should have no sin  but now ye say  we see  therefor your sin remaineth  10  1 verili  verili  i say unto you  he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold  but climbeth up some other way  the same is a thief and a robber  10  2 but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep  10  3 to him the porter openeth  and the sheep hear his voic  and he calleth his own sheep by name  and leadeth them out  10  4 and when he putteth forth his own sheep  he goeth befor them  and the sheep follow him  for they know his voic  10  5 and a stranger will they not follow  but will flee from him  for they know not the voic of stranger  10  6 this parabl spake jesus unto them  but they understood not what thing they were which he spake unto them  10  7 then said jesus unto them again  verili  verili  i say unto you  i am the door of the sheep  10  8 all that ever came befor me are thiev and robber  but the sheep did not hear them  10  9 i am the door  by me if ani man enter in  he shall be save  and shall go in and out  and find pastur  10  10 the thief cometh not

them  mani good work have i shew you from my father  for which of those work do ye stone me  10  33 the jew answer him  say  for a good work we stone thee not  but for blasphemi  and becaus that thou

 10  36 say ye of him  whom the father hath sanctifi  and sent into the world  thou blasphemest  becaus i said  i am the son of god  10  37 if i do not the work of my father  believ me not  10  38 but if i do  though ye believ not me  believ the work  that ye may know  and believ  that the father is in me  and i in him  10  39 therefor they sought again to take him  but he escap out of their hand  10  40 and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptiz  and there he abod  10  41 and mani resort unto him  and said  john did no miracl  but all thing that john spake of this man were true  10  42 and mani believ on him there  11  1 now a certain man was sick  name lazarus  of bethani  the town of mari and her sister martha  11  2  it was that mari which anoint the lord with ointment  and wipe his feet with her hair  whose brother lazarus was sick  11  3 therefor his sister sent unto him  say  lord  behold  he whom thou lovest is sick  11  4 when jesus heard that  he said  this sick is not unto death  but for the glori of god  that the son of god might be glorifi therebi  11  5 now jesus love martha  and her sister  and lazarus  11  6 when he had heard therefor that he was sick  he abod two day still in the same place where he was  11  7 then after that saith he to his discipl  let us go into judaea again  11  8 his discipl say unto him  master  the jew of late sought to stone thee  and goest thou thither again  11  9 jesus answer  are there not twelv hour in the day  if ani man walk in the day  he stumbleth not  becaus he seeth the light of this world  11  10 but if a man walk in the night  he stumbleth  becaus there is no light in him  11  11 these thing said he  and after that he saith unto them  our friend lazarus sleepeth  but i go  that i may awak him out of sleep  11  12 then said his discipl  lord  if he sleep  he shall do well  11  13 howbeit jesus spake of his death  but they thought that he had spoken of take of rest in sleep  11  14 then said jesus unto them plain  lazarus is dead  11  15 and i am glad for your sake that i was not there  to the intent ye may believ  nevertheless let us go unto him  11  16 then said thoma  which is call didymus  unto his fellowdiscipl  let us also go  that we may die with him  11  17 then when jesus came  he found that he had lain in the grave four day alreadi  11  18 now bethani was nigh unto jerusalem  about fifteen furlong off  11  19 and mani of the jew came to martha and mari  to comfort them concern their brother  11  20 then martha  as soon as she heard that jesus was come  went and met him  but mari sat still in the hous  11  21 then said martha unto jesus  lord  if thou hadst been here  my brother had not die  11  22 but i know  that even now  whatsoev thou wilt ask of god  god will give it thee  11  23 jesus saith unto her  thi brother shall rise again  11  24 martha saith unto him  i know that he shall rise again in the resurrect at the last day  11  25 jesus said unto her  i am the resurrect  and the life  he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  11  26 and whosoev liveth and believeth in me shall never die  believest thou this  11  27 she saith unto him  yea  lord  i believ that thou art the christ  the son of god  which should come into the world  11  28 and when she had so said  she went her way  and call mari her sister secret  say  the master is come  and calleth for thee  11  29 as soon as she heard that  she aros quick  and came unto him  11  30 now jesus was not yet come into the town  but was in that place where martha met him  11  31 the jew then which were with her in the hous  and comfort her  when they saw mari  that she rose up hastili and went out  follow her  say  she goeth unto the grave to weep there  11  32 then when mari was come where jesus was  and saw him  she fell down at his feet  say unto him  lord  if thou hadst been here  my brother had not die  11  33 when jesus therefor saw her weep  and the jew also weep which came with her  he groan in the spirit  and was troubl  11  34 and said  where have ye laid him  they said unto him  lord  come and see  11  35 jesus wept  11  36 then said the jew  behold how he love him  11  37 and some of them said  could not this man  which open the eye of the blind  have caus that even this man should not have die  11  38 jesus therefor again groan in himself cometh to the grave  it was a cave  and a stone lay upon it  11  39 jesus said  take ye away the stone  martha  the sister of him that was dead  saith unto him  lord  by this time he stinketh  for he hath been dead four day  11  40 jesus saith unto her  said i not unto thee  that  if thou wouldest believ  thou shouldest see the glori of god  11  41 then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid  and jesus lift up his eye  and said  father  i thank thee that thou hast heard me  11  42 and i knew that thou hearest me alway  but becaus of the peopl which stand by i said it  that they may believ that thou hast sent me  11  43 and when he thus had spoken  he cri with a loud voic  lazarus  come forth  11  44 and he that was dead came forth  bound hand and foot with gravecloth  and his face was bound about with a napkin  jesus saith unto them  loos him  and let him go  11  45 then mani of the jew which came to mari  and had seen the thing which jesus did  believ on him  11  46 but some of them went their way to the pharise  and told them what thing jesus had done  11  47 then gather the chief priest and the pharise a council  and said  what do we  for this man doeth mani miracl  11  48 if we let him thus alon  all men will believ on him  and the roman shall come and take away both our place and nation  11  49 and one of them  name caiapha  be the high priest that same year  said unto them  ye know noth at all  11  50 nor consid that it is expedi for us  that one man should die for the peopl  and that the whole nation perish not  11  51 and this spake he not of himself  but be high priest that year  he prophesi that jesus should die for that nation  11  52 and not for that nation onli  but that also he should gather togeth in one the children of god that were scatter abroad  11  53 then from that day forth they took counsel togeth for to put him to death  11  54 jesus therefor walk no more open among the jew  but went thenc unto a countri near to the wilder  into a citi call ephraim  and there continu with his discipl  11  55 and the jew  passov was nigh at hand  and mani went out of the countri up to jerusalem befor the passov  to purifi themselv  11  56 then sought they for jesus  and spake among themselv  as they stood in the templ  what think ye  that he will not come to the feast  11  57 now both the chief priest and the pharise had given a command  that  if ani man knew where he were  he should shew it  that they might take him  12  1 then jesus six day befor the passov came to bethani  where lazarus was  which had been dead  whom he rais from the dead  12  2 there they made him a supper  and martha serv  but lazarus was one of them that sat at the tabl with him  12  3 then took mari a pound of ointment of spikenard  veri cost  and anoint the feet of jesus  and wipe his feet with her hair  and the hous was fill with the odour of the ointment  12  4 then saith one of his discipl  juda iscariot  simon  s son  which should betray him  12  5 whi was not this ointment sold for three hundr penc  and given to the poor  12  6 this he said  not that he care for the poor  but becaus he was a thief  and had the bag  and bare what was put therein  12  7 then said jesus  let her alon  against the day of my buri hath she kept this  12  8 for the poor alway ye have with you  but me ye have not alway  12  9 much peopl of the jew therefor knew that he was there  and they came not for jesus  sake onli  but that they might see lazarus also  whom he had rais from the dead  12  10 but the chief priest consult that they might put lazarus also to death  12  11 becaus that by reason of him mani of the jew went away  and believ on jesus  12  12 on the next day much peopl that were come to the feast  when they heard that jesus was come to jerusalem  12  13 took branch of palm tree  and went forth to meet him  and cri  hosanna  bless is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord  12  14 and jesus  when he had found a young ass  sat thereon  as it is written  12  15 fear not  daughter of sion  behold  thi king cometh  sit on an ass  s colt  12  16 these thing understood not his discipl at the first  but when jesus was glorifi  then rememb they that these thing were written of him  and that they had done these thing unto him  12  17 the peopl therefor that was with him when he call lazarus out of his grave  and rais him from the dead  bare record  12  18 for this caus the peopl also met him  for that they heard that he had done this miracl  12  19 the pharise therefor said among themselv  perceiv ye how ye prevail noth  behold  the world is gone after him  12  20 and there were certain greek among them that came up to worship at the feast  12  21 the same came therefor to philip  which was of bethsaida of galile  and desir him  say  sir  we would see jesus  12  22 philip cometh and telleth andrew  and again andrew and philip tell jesus  12  23 and jesus answer them  say  the hour is come  that the son of man should be glorifi  12  24 verili  verili  i say unto you  except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die  it abideth alon  but if it die  it bringeth forth much fruit  12  25 he that loveth his life shall lose it  and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life etern  12  26 if ani man serv me  let him follow me  and where i am  there shall also my servant be  if ani man serv me  him will my father honour  12  27 now is my soul troubl  and what shall i say  father  save me from this hour  but for this caus came i unto this hour  12  28 father  glorifi thi name  then came there a voic from heaven  say  i have both glorifi it  and will glorifi it again  12  29 the peopl therefor  that stood by  and heard it  said that it thunder  other said  an angel spake to him  12  30 jesus answer and said  this voic came not becaus of me  but for your sake  12  31 now is the judgment of this world  now shall the princ of this world be cast out  12  32 and i  if i be lift up from the earth  will draw all men unto me  12  33 this he said  signifi what death he should die  12  34 the peopl answer him  we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever  and how sayest thou  the son of man must be lift up  who is this son of man  12  35 then jesus said unto them  yet a littl while is the light with you  walk while ye have the light  lest dark come upon you  for he that walketh in dark knoweth not whither he goeth  12  36 while ye have light  believ in the light  that ye may be the children of light  these thing spake jesus  and depart  and did hide himself from them  12  37 but though he had done so mani miracl befor them  yet they believ not on him  12  38 that the say of esaia the prophet might be fulfil  which he spake  lord  who hath believ our report  and to whom hath the arm of the lord been reveal  12  39 therefor they could not believ  becaus that esaia said again  12  40 he hath blind their eye  and harden their heart  that they should not see with their eye  nor understand with their heart  and be convert  and i should heal them  12  41 these thing said esaia  when he saw his glori  and spake of him  12  42 nevertheless among the chief ruler also mani believ on him  but becaus of the pharise they did not confess him  lest they should be put out of the synagogu  12  43 for they love the prais of men more than the prais of god  12  44 jesus cri and said  he that believeth on me  believeth not on me  but on him that sent me  12  45 and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me  12  46 i am come a light into the world  that whosoev believeth on me should not abid in dark  12  47 and if ani man hear my word  and believ not  i judg him not  for i came not to judg the world  but to save the world  12  48 he that rejecteth me  and receiveth not my word  hath one that judgeth him  the word that i have spoken  the same shall judg him in the last day  12  49 for i have not spoken of myself  but the father which sent me  he gave me a command  what i should say  and what i should speak  12  50 and i know that his command is life everlast  whatsoev i speak therefor  even as the father said unto me  so i speak  13  1 now befor the feast of the passov  when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father  have love his own which were in the world  he love them unto the end  13  2 and supper be end  the devil have now put into the heart of juda iscariot  simon  s son  to betray him  13  3 jesus know that the father had given all thing into his hand  and that he was come from god  and went to god  13  4 he riseth from supper  and laid asid his garment  and took a towel  and gird himself  13  5 after that he poureth water into a bason  and began to wash the discipl  feet  and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was gird  13  6 then cometh he to simon peter  and peter saith unto him  lord  dost thou wash my feet  13  7 jesus answer and said unto him  what i do thou knowest not now  but thou shalt know hereaft  13  8 peter saith unto him  thou shalt never wash my feet  jesus answer him  if i wash thee not  thou hast no part with me  13  9 simon peter saith unto him  lord  not my feet onli  but also my hand and my head  13  10 jesus saith to him  he that is wash needeth not save to wash his feet  but is clean everi whit  and ye are clean  but not all  13  11 for he knew who should betray him  therefor said he  ye are not all clean  13  12 so after he had wash their feet  and had taken his garment  and was set down again  he said unto them  know ye what i have done to you  13  13 ye call me master and lord  and ye say well  for so i am  13  14 if i then  your lord and master  have wash your feet  ye also ought to wash one anoth  s feet  13  15 for i have given you an exampl  that ye should do as i have done to you  13  16 verili  verili  i say unto you  the servant is not greater than his lord  neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him  13  17 if ye know these thing  happi are ye if ye do them  13  18 i speak not of you all  i know whom i have chosen  but that the scriptur may be fulfil  he that eateth bread with me hath lift up his heel against me  13  19 now i tell you befor it come  that  when it is come to pass  ye may believ that i am he  13  20 verili  verili  i say unto you  he that receiveth whomsoev i send receiveth me  and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me  13  21 when jesus had thus said  he was troubl in spirit  and testifi  and said  verili  verili  i say unto you  that one of you shall betray me  13  22 then the discipl look one on anoth  doubt of whom he spake  13  23 now there was lean on jesus  bosom one of his discipl  whom jesus love  13  24 simon peter therefor beckon to him  that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake  13  25 he then lie on jesus  breast saith unto him  lord  who is it  13  26 jesus answer  he it is  to whom i shall give a sop  when i have dip it  and when he had dip the sop  he gave it to juda iscariot  the son of simon  13  27 and after the sop satan enter into him  then said jesus unto him  that thou doest  do quick  13  28 now no man at the tabl knew for what intent he spake this unto him  13  29 for some of them thought  becaus juda had the bag  that jesus had said unto him  buy those thing that we have need of against the feast  or  that he should give someth to the poor  13  30 he then have receiv the sop went immedi out  and it was night  13  31 therefor  when he was gone out  jesus said  now is the son of man glorifi  and god is glorifi in him  13  32 if god be glorifi in him  god shall also glorifi him in himself  and shall straightway glorifi him  13  33 littl children  yet a littl while i am with you  ye shall seek me  and as i said unto the jew  whither i go  ye cannot come  so now i say to you  13  34 a new command i give unto you  that ye love one anoth  as i have love you  that ye also love one anoth  13  35 by this shall all men know that ye are my discipl  if ye have love one to anoth  13  36 simon peter said unto him  lord  whither goest thou  jesus answer him  whither i go  thou canst not follow me now  but thou shalt follow me afterward  13  37 peter said unto him  lord  whi cannot i follow thee now  i will lay down my life for thi sake  13  38 jesus answer him  wilt thou lay down thi life for my sake  verili  verili  i say unto thee  the cock shall not crow  till thou hast deni me thrice  14  1 let not your heart be troubl  ye believ in god  believ also in me  14  2 in my father  s hous are mani mansion  if it were not so  i would have told you  i go to prepar a place for you  14  3 and if i go and prepar a place for you  i will come

can we know the way  14  6 jesus saith unto him  i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me  14  7 if ye had known me  ye should have known my father also  and from henceforth ye know him  and have seen him  14  8 philip saith unto him  lord  shew us the father  and it sufficeth us  14  9 jesus saith unto him  have i been so long time with you  and yet hast thou not known me  philip  he that hath seen me hath seen the father  and how sayest thou then  shew us the father  14  10 believest thou not that i am in the father  and the father in me  the word that i speak unto you i speak not of myself  but the father that dwelleth in me  he doeth the work  14  11 believ me that i am in the father  and the father in me  or els believ me for the veri work  sake  14  12 verili  verili  i say unto you  he that believeth on me  the work that i do shall he do also  and greater work than these shall he do  becaus i go unto my father  14  13 and whatsoev ye shall ask in my name  that will i do  that the father may be glorifi in the son  14  14 if ye shall ask ani thing in my name  i will do it  14  15 if ye love me  keep my command  14  16 and i will pray the father  and he shall give you anoth comfort  that he may abid with you for ever  14  17 even the spirit of truth  whom the world cannot receiv  becaus it seeth him not  neither knoweth him  but ye know him  for he dwelleth with you  and shall be in you  14  18 i will not leav you comfortless  i will come to you  14  19 yet a littl while  and the world seeth me no more  but ye see me  becaus i live  ye shall live also  14  20 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father  and ye in me  and i in you  14  21 he that hath my command  and keepeth them  he it is that loveth me  and he that loveth me shall be love of my father  and i will love him  and will manifest myself to him  14  22 juda saith unto him  not iscariot  lord  how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us  and not unto the world  14  23 jesus answer and said unto him  if a man love me  he will keep my word  and my father will love him  and we will come unto him  and make our abod with him  14  24 he that loveth me not keepeth not my say  and the word which ye hear is not mine  but the father  s which sent me  14  25 these thing have i spoken unto you  be yet present with you  14  26 but the

if ye love me  ye would rejoic  becaus i said  i go unto the father  for my father is greater than i  14  29 and now i have told you befor it come to pass  that  when it is come to pass  ye might believ  14  30 hereaft i will not talk much with you  for the princ of this world cometh  and hath noth in me  14  31 but that the world may know that i love the father  and as the father gave me command  even so i do  aris  let us go henc  15  1 i am the true vine  and my father is the husbandman  15  2 everi branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away  and everi branch that beareth fruit  he purgeth it  that it may bring forth more fruit  15  3 now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you  15  4 abid in me  and i in you  as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself  except it abid in the vine  no more can ye  except ye abid in me  15  5 i am the vine  ye are the branch  he that abideth in me  and i in him  the same bringeth forth much fruit  for without me ye can do noth  15  6 if a man abid not in me  he is cast forth as a branch  and is wither  and men gather them  and cast them into the fire  and they are burn  15  7 if ye abid in me  and my word abid in you  ye shall ask what ye will  and it shall be done unto you  15  8 herein is my father glorifi  that ye bear much fruit  so shall ye be my discipl  15  9 as the father hath love me  so have

that my joy might remain in you  and that your joy might be full  15  12 this is my command  that ye love one anoth  as i have love you  15  13 greater love hath no man than this  that a man lay down his life for his friend  15  14 ye are my friend  if ye do whatsoev i command you  15  15 henceforth i call you not servant  for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth  but i have call you friend  for all thing that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you  15  16 ye have not chosen me  but i have chosen you  and ordain you  that ye should go and bring forth fruit  and that your fruit should remain  that whatsoev ye shall ask of the father in my name  he may give it you  15  17 these thing i command you  that ye love one anoth  15  18 if the world hate you  ye know that it hate me befor it hate you  15  19 if ye were of the world  the world would love his own  but becaus ye are not of the world  but i have chosen you out of the world  therefor the world hateth you  15  20 rememb the word that i said unto you  the servant is not greater than his lord  if they have persecut me  they will also persecut you  if they have kept my say  they will keep your also  15  21 but all these thing will they do unto you for my name  s sake  becaus they know not him that sent me  15  22 if i had not come and spoken unto them  they had not had sin  but now they have no cloak for

and when he had said this  he breath on them  and saith unto them  receiv ye the holi ghost  20  23 whose soever sin ye remit  they are remit unto them  and whose soever sin ye retain  they are retain  20  24 but thoma  one of the twelv  call didymus  was not with them when jesus came  20  25 the other discipl therefor said unto him  we have seen the lord  but he said unto them  except i shall see

spake unto the peopl  the priest  and the captain of the templ  and the sadduce  came upon them  4  2 be griev that they taught the peopl  and preach through jesus the resurrect from the dead  4  3 and they laid hand on them  and put them in hold unto the next day  for it was now eventid  4  4 howbeit mani of them which heard the word believ  and the number of the men was about five thousand  4  5 and it came to pass on the morrow  that their ruler  and elder  and scribe  4  6 and anna the high priest  and caiapha  and john  and alexand  and as mani as were of the kindr of the high priest  were gather togeth at jerusalem  4  7 and when they had set them in the midst  they ask  by what power  or by what name  have ye done this  4  8 then peter  fill with the holi ghost  said unto them  ye ruler of the peopl  and elder of israel  4  9 if we this day be examin of the good deed done to the impot man  by what mean he is made whole  4  10 be it known unto you all  and to all the peopl of

when they saw the bold of peter and john  and perceiv that they were unlearn and ignor men  they marvel  and they took knowledg of them  that they had been with jesus  4  14 and behold the man which was heal stand with them  they could say noth against it  4  15 but when they had command them to go asid out of the council  they confer among themselv  4  16 say  what shall we do to these men  for that inde a notabl miracl hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem  and we cannot deni it  4  17 but that it spread no further among the peopl  let us strait threaten them  that they speak henceforth to no man in this name  4  18 and they call them  and command them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus  4  19 but peter and john answer and said unto them  whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god  judg ye  4  20 for we cannot but speak the thing which we have seen and heard  4  21 so when they had further threaten them  they let them go  find noth how they might punish them  becaus of the peopl  for all men glorifi god for that which was done  4  22 for the man was abov forti year old  on whom this miracl of heal was shew  4  23 and be let go  they went to their own compani  and report all that the chief priest and elder had said unto them  4  24 and when they heard that  they lift up their voic to god with one accord  and said  lord  thou art god  which hast made heaven  and earth  and the sea  and all that in them is  4  25 who by the mouth of thi servant david hast said  whi did the heathen rage  and the peopl imagin vain thing  4  26 the king of the earth stood up  and the ruler were gather togeth against the lord  and against his christ  4  27 for of a truth against thi holi

done by the name of thi holi child jesus  4  31 and when they had pray  the place was shaken where they were assembl togeth  and they were all fill with the holi ghost  and they spake the word of god with bold  4  32 and the multitud of them that believ were of one heart and of one soul  neither said ani of them that ought of the thing which he possess was his own  but they had all thing common  4  33 and with great power gave the apostl wit of the resurrect of the lord jesus  and great grace was upon them all  4  34 neither was there ani among them that lack  for as mani as were possessor of land or hous sold them  and brought the price of the thing that were sold  4  35 and laid them down at the apostl  feet  and distribut was made unto everi man accord as he had need  4  36 and jose  who by the apostl was surnam barnaba   which is  be interpret  the son of consol  a levit  and of the countri of cyprus  4  37 have land  sold it  and brought the money  and laid it at the apostl  feet  5  1 but a certain man name anania  with sapphira his wife  sold a possess  5  2 and kept back part of the price  his wife also be privi to it  and brought a certain part  and laid it at the apostl  feet  5  3 but peter said  anania  whi hath satan fill thine heart to lie to the holi ghost  and to keep back part of the price of the land  5  4 while it remain  was it not thine own  and after it was sold  was it not in thine own power  whi hast thou conceiv this thing in thine heart  thou hast not lie unto men  but unto god  5  5 and anania hear these word fell down  and gave up the ghost  and great fear came on all them that heard these thing  5  6 and the young men aros  wound him up  and carri him out  and buri him  5  7 and it was about the space of three hour after  when his wife  not know what was done  came in  5  8 and peter answer unto her  tell me whether ye sold the land for so much  and she said  yea  for so much  5  9 then peter said unto her  how is it that ye have agre togeth to tempt the spirit of the lord  behold  the feet of them which have buri thi husband are at the door  and shall carri thee out  5  10 then fell she down straightway at his feet  and yield up the ghost  and the young men came in  and found her dead  and  carri her forth  buri her by her husband  5  11 and great fear came upon all the church  and upon as mani as heard these thing  5  12 and by the hand of the apostl were mani sign and wonder wrought among the peopl   and they were all with one accord in solomon  s porch  5  13 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them  but the peopl magnifi them  5  14 and believ were the more ad to the lord  multitud both of men and women  5  15 insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the street  and laid them on bed and couch  that at the least the shadow of peter pass by might overshadow some of them  5  16 there came also a multitud out of the citi round about unto jerusalem  bring sick folk  and them which were vex with unclean spirit  and they were heal everi one  5  17 then the high priest rose up  and all they that were with him   which is the sect of the sadduce  and were fill with indign  5  18 and laid their hand on the apostl  and put them in the common prison  5  19 but the angel of the lord by night open the prison door  and brought them forth  and said  5  20 go  stand and speak in the templ to the peopl all the word of this life  5  21 and when they heard that  they enter into the templ earli in the morn  and taught  but the high priest came  and they that were with him  and call the council togeth  and all the senat of the children of israel  and sent to the prison to have them brought  5  22 but when the offic came  and found them not in the prison  they return and told  5  23 say  the prison truli found we shut with all safeti  and the keeper stand without befor the door  but when we had open  we found no man within  5  24 now when the high priest and the captain of the templ and the chief priest heard these thing  they doubt of them whereunto this would grow  5  25 then came one and told them  say  behold  the men whom ye put in prison are stand in the templ  and teach the peopl  5  26 then went the captain with the offic  and brought them without violenc  for they fear the peopl  lest they should have been stone  5  27 and when they had brought them  they set them befor the council  and the high priest ask them  5  28 say  did not we strait command you that ye should not teach in this name  and  behold  ye have fill jerusalem with your doctrin  and intend to bring this man  s blood upon us  5  29 then peter and the other apostl answer and said  we ought to obey god rather than men  5  30 the god of our father rais up jesus  whom ye slew and hang on a tree  5  31 him hath god exalt with his right hand to be a princ and a saviour  for to give repent to israel  and forgiv of sin  5  32 and we are his wit of these thing  and so is also the holi ghost  whom god hath given to them that obey him  5  33 when they heard that  they were cut to the heart  and took counsel to slay them  5  34 then stood there up one in the council  a pharise  name gamaliel  a doctor of the law  had in reput among all the peopl  and command to put the apostl forth a littl space  5  35 and said unto them  ye men of israel  take heed to yourselv what ye intend to do as

scatter  and brought to nought  5  37 after this man rose up juda of galile in the day of the tax  and drew away much peopl after him  he also perish  and all  even as mani as obey him  were dispers  5  38 and now i say unto you  refrain from these men  and let them alon  for if this counsel or this work be of men  it will come to nought  5  39 but if it be of god  ye cannot overthrow it  lest hapli ye be found even to fight against god  5  40 and to him they agre  and when they had call the apostl  and beaten them  they command that they should not speak in the name of jesus  and let them go  5  41 and they depart from the presenc of the council  rejoic that they were count worthi to suffer shame for his name  5  42 and daili in the templ  and in everi hous  they ceas not to teach and preach jesus christ  6  1 and in those day  when the number of the discipl was multipli  there aros a murmur of the grecian against the hebrew  becaus their widow were neglect in the daili ministr  6  2 then the twelv call the multitud of the discipl unto them  and said  it is not reason that we should leav the word of god  and serv tabl  6  3 wherefor  brethren  look ye out among you seven men of honest report  full of the holi ghost and wisdom  whom we may appoint over this busi  6  4 but we will give ourselv continu to prayer  and to the ministri of the word  6  5 and the say pleas the whole multitud  and they chose stephen  a man full of faith and of the holi ghost  and philip  and prochorus  and nicanor  and timon  and parmena  and nicola a proselyt of antioch  6  6 whom they set befor the apostl  and when they had pray  they laid their hand on them  6  7 and the word of god increas  and the number of the discipl multipli in jerusalem great  and a great compani of the priest were obedi to the faith  6  8 and stephen  full of faith and power  did great wonder and miracl among the peopl  6  9 then there aros certain of the synagogu  which is call the synagogu of the libertin  and cyrenian  and alexandrian  and of them of cilicia and of asia  disput with stephen  6  10 and they were not abl to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake  6  11 then they suborn men  which said  we have heard him speak blasphem word against mose  and against god  6  12 and they stir up the peopl  and the elder  and the scribe  and came upon him  and caught him  and brought him to the council  6  13 and set up fals wit  which said  this man ceaseth not to speak blasphem word against this holi place  and the law  6  14 for we have heard him say  that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place  and shall chang the custom which mose deliv us  6  15 and all that sat in the council  look stedfast on him  saw his face as it had been the face of an angel  7  1 then said the high priest  are these thing so  7  2 and he said  men  brethren  and father  hearken  the god of glori appear unto our father abraham  when he was in mesopotamia  befor he dwelt in charran  7  3 and said unto him  get thee out of thi countri  and from thi kindr  and come into the land which i shall shew thee  7  4 then came he out of the land of the chaldaean  and dwelt in charran  and from thenc  when his father was dead  he remov him into this land  wherein ye now dwell  7  5 and he gave him none inherit in it  no  not so much as to set his foot on  yet he promis that he would give it to him for a possess  and to his seed after him  when as yet he had no child  7  6 and god spake on this wise  that his seed should sojourn in a strang land  and that they should bring them into bondag  and entreat them evil four hundr year  7  7 and the nation to whom they shall be in bondag will i judg  said god  and after that shall they come forth  and serv me in this place  7  8 and he gave him the coven of circumcis  and so abraham begat isaac  and circumcis him the eighth day  and isaac begat jacob  and jacob begat the twelv patriarch  7  9 and the patriarch  move with envi  sold joseph into egypt  but god was with him  7  10 and deliv him out of all his afflict  and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt  and he made him governor over egypt and all his hous  7  11 now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan  and great afflict  and our father found no susten  7  12 but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt  he sent out our father first  7  13 and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren  and joseph  s kindr was made known unto pharaoh  7  14 then sent joseph  and call his father jacob to him  and all his kindr

wisdom of the egyptian  and was mighti in word and in deed  7  23 and when he was full forti year old  it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel  7  24 and see one of them suffer wrong  he defend him  and aveng him that was oppress  and smote the egyptian  7  25 for he suppos his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliv them  but they

his neighbour wrong thrust him away  say  who made thee a ruler and a judg over us  7  28 wilt thou kill me  as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday  7  29 then fled mose at this say  and was a

envi  and spake against those thing which were spoken by paul  contradict and blasphem  13  46 then paul and barnaba wax bold  and said  it was necessari that the word of god should first have been spoken to you  but see ye put it from you  and judg yourselv unworthi of everlast life  lo  we turn to the gentil  13  47 for so hath the lord command us  say  i have set thee to be a light of the

 1 and it came to pass in iconium  that they went both togeth into the synagogu of the jew  and so spake  that a great multitud both of the jew and also of the greek believ  14  2 but the unbeliev jew stir up the gentil  and made their mind evil affect against the brethren  14  3 long time therefor abod they speak bold in the lord  which gave testimoni unto the word of his grace  and grant sign and wonder to be done by their hand  14  4 but the multitud of the citi was divid  and part held with the jew  and part with the apostl  14  5 and when there was an assault made both of the gentil  and also of the jew with their ruler  to use them despit  and to stone them  14  6 they were ware of it  and fled unto lystra and derb  citi of lycaonia  and unto the region that lieth round about  14  7 and there they preach the gospel  14  8 and there sat a certain man at lystra  impot in his feet  be a crippl from his mother  s womb  who never had walk  14  9 the same heard paul speak  who stedfast

as the discipl stood round about him  he rose up  and came into the citi  and the next day he depart with barnaba to derb  14  21 and when they had preach the gospel to that citi  and had taught mani  they return again to lystra  and to iconium  and antioch  14  22 confirm the soul of the discipl  and exhort them to continu in the faith  and that we must through much tribul enter into the kingdom of god  14  23 and when they had ordain them elder in everi church  and had pray with fast  they commend them to the lord  on whom they believ  14  24 and after they had pass throughout pisidia  they came to pamphylia  14  25 and when they had preach the word in perga  they went down into attalia  14  26 and thenc sail to antioch  from whenc they had been recommend to the grace of god for the work

there they abod long time with the discipl  15  1 and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren  and said  except ye be circumcis after the manner of mose  ye cannot be save  15  2 when therefor paul and barnaba had no small dissens and disput with them  they determin that paul and barnaba  and certain other of them  should go up to jerusalem unto the apostl and elder about this question  15  3 and be brought on their way by the church  they pass through phenic and samaria  declar the convers of the gentil  and they caus great joy unto all the brethren  15  4 and when they were come to jerusalem  they were receiv of the church  and of the apostl and elder  and they declar all thing that god had done with them  15  5 but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharise which believ  say  that it was need to circumcis them  and to command them to keep the law of mose  15  6 and the apostl and elder came togeth for to consid of this matter  15  7 and when there had been much disput  peter rose up  and said unto them  men and brethren  ye know how that a good while ago god made choic among us  that the gentil by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel  and believ  15  8 and god  which knoweth the heart  bare them wit  give them the holi ghost  even as he did unto us  15  9 and put no differ between us and them  purifi their heart by faith  15  10 now therefor whi tempt ye god  to put a yoke upon the neck of the discipl  which neither our father nor we were abl to bear  15  11 but we believ that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be save  even as they  15  12 then all the multitud kept silenc  and gave audienc to barnaba and paul  declar what miracl and wonder god had wrought among the gentil by them  15  13 and after they had held their peac  jame answer  say  men and brethren  hearken unto me  15  14 simeon hath declar how god at the first did visit the gentil  to take out of them a peopl for his name  15  15 and to this agre the word of the prophet  as it is written  15  16 after this i will return  and will build again the tabernacl of david  which is fallen down  and i will build again the ruin thereof  and i will set it up  15  17 that the residu of men might seek after the lord  and all the gentil  upon whom my name is call  saith the lord  who doeth all these thing  15  18 known unto god are all his work from the begin of the world  15  19 wherefor my sentenc is  that we troubl not them  which from among the gentil are turn to god  15  20 but that we write unto them  that they abstain from pollut of idol  and from fornic  and from thing strangl  and from blood  15  21 for mose of old time hath in everi citi them that preach him  be read in the synagogu everi sabbath day  15  22 then pleas it the apostl and elder with the whole church  to send chosen men of their own compani to antioch with paul and barnaba  name  juda surnam barsaba and sila  chief men among the brethren  15  23 and they wrote letter by them after this manner  the apostl and elder and brethren send greet unto the brethren which are of the gentil in antioch and syria and cilicia  15  24 forasmuch as we have heard  that certain which went out from us have troubl you with word  subvert your soul  say  ye must be circumcis  and keep the law  to whom we gave no such command  15  25 it seem good unto us  be assembl with one accord  to send chosen men unto you with our belov barnaba and paul  15  26 men that have hazard their live for the name of our lord jesus christ  15  27 we have sent therefor juda and sila  who

where we have preach the word of the lord  and see how they do  15  37 and barnaba determin to take with them john  whose surnam was mark  15  38 but paul thought not good to take him with them  who depart from them from pamphylia  and went not with them to the work  15  39 and the content was so sharp between them  that they depart asund one from the other  and so barnaba took mark  and sail

brethren that were at lystra and iconium  16  3 him would paul have to go forth with him  and took and circumcis him becaus of the jew which were in those quarter  for they knew all that his father was a greek  16  4 and as they went through the citi  they deliv them the decre for to keep  that were ordain of the apostl and elder which were at jerusalem  16  5 and so were the church establish in the faith  and increas in number daili  16  6 now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia  and were forbidden of the holi ghost to preach the word in asia  16  7 after they

and when they had seen the brethren  they comfort them  and depart  17  1 now when they had pass through amphipoli and apollonia  they came to thessalonica  where was a synagogu of the jew  17  2 and

would know therefor what these thing mean  17  21  for all the athenian and stranger which were there spent their time in noth els  but either to tell  or to hear some new thing  17  22 then paul stood in the midst of mar  hill  and said  ye men of athen  i perceiv that in all thing ye are too superstiti  17  23 for as i pass by  and beheld your devot  i found an altar with this inscript  to

brought him to the judgment seat  18  13 say  this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrari to the law  18  14 and when paul was now about to open his mouth  gallio said unto the jew  if it were a matter of wrong or wick lewd  o ye jew  reason would that i should bear with you  18  15 but if it be a question of word and name  and of your law  look ye to it  for i will be no judg of such matter  18  16 and he drave them from the judgment seat  18  17 then all the greek took sosthen  the chief ruler of the synagogu  and beat him befor the judgment seat  and gallio care for none of

who  when he was come  help them much which had believ through grace  18  28 for he mightili convinc the jew  and that publick  shew by the scriptur that jesus was christ  19  1 and it came to pass  that  while apollo was at corinth  paul have pass through the upper coast came to ephesus  and find certain discipl  19  2 he said unto them  have ye receiv the holi ghost sinc ye believ  and they said unto him  we have not so much as heard whether there be ani holi ghost  19  3 and he said unto them  unto what then were ye baptiz  and they said  unto john  s baptism  19  4 then said paul  john verili baptiz with the baptism of repent  say unto the peopl  that they should believ on him which should come after him  that is  on christ jesus  19  5 when they heard this  they were baptiz in the name of the lord jesus  19  6 and when paul had laid his hand upon them  the holi ghost came on them  and they spake with tongu  and prophesi  19  7 and all the men were about twelv  19  8 and he went into the synagogu  and spake bold for the space of three month  disput and persuad the thing concern the kingdom of god  19  9 but when diver were harden  and believ not  but spake evil of that way befor the multitud  he depart from them  and separ the discipl  disput daili in the school of one tyrannus  19  10 and this continu by the space of two year  so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus  both jew and greek  19  11 and god wrought special miracl by the hand of paul  19  12 so that from his bodi were brought unto the sick handkerchief or apron  and the diseas depart from them  and the evil spirit went out of them  19  13 then certain of the vagabond jew  exorcist  took upon them to call over them which had evil spirit the name of the lord jesus  say  we adjur you by jesus whom paul preacheth  19  14 and there were seven son of one sceva  a jew  and chief of the priest  which did so  19  15 and the evil spirit answer and said  jesus i know  and paul i know  but who are ye  19  16 and the man in whom the evil spirit was leap on them  and overcam them  and prevail against them  so that they fled out of that hous nake and wound  19  17 and this was known to all the jew and greek also dwell at ephesus  and fear fell on them all  and the name of the lord jesus was magnifi  19  18 and mani that believ came  and confess  and shew their deed  19  19 mani of them also which use curious art brought their book togeth  and burn them befor all men  and they count the price of them  and found it fifti thousand piec of silver  19  20 so mightili grew the word of god and prevail  19  21 after these thing were end  paul purpos in the spirit  when he had pass through macedonia and achaia  to go to jerusalem  say  after i have been there  i must also see rome  19  22 so he sent into macedonia two of them that minist unto him  timotheus and erastus  but he himself stay in asia for a season  19  23 and the same time there aros no small stir about that way  19  24 for a certain man name demetrius  a silversmith  which made silver shrine for diana  brought no small gain unto the craftsmen  19  25 whom he call togeth with the workmen of like occup  and said  sir  ye know that by this craft we have our wealth  19  26 moreov ye see and hear  that not alon at ephesus  but almost throughout all asia  this paul hath persuad and turn away much peopl  say that they be no god  which are made with hand  19  27 so that not onli this our craft is in danger to be set at nought  but also that the templ of the great goddess diana should be despis  and her magnific should be destroy  whom all asia and the world worshippeth  19  28 and when they heard these say  they were full of wrath  and cri out  say  great is diana of the ephesian  19  29 and the whole citi was fill with confus  and have caught gaius and aristarchus  men of macedonia  paul  s companion in travel  they rush with one accord into the theatr  19  30 and when paul would have enter in unto the peopl  the discipl suffer him not  19  31 and certain of the chief of asia  which were his friend  sent unto him  desir him that he would not adventur himself into the theatr  19  32 some therefor cri one thing  and some anoth  for the assembl was confus  and the more part knew not wherefor they were come togeth  19  33 and they drew alexand out of the multitud  the jew put him forward  and alexand beckon with the hand  and would have made his defenc unto the peopl  19  34 but when they knew that he was a jew  all with one voic about the space of two hour cri out  great is diana of the ephesian  19  35 and when the townclerk had appeas the peopl  he said  ye men of ephesus  what man is there that knoweth not how that the citi of the ephesian is a worshipp of the great goddess diana  and of the imag which fell down from jupit  19  36 see then that these thing cannot be spoken against  ye ought to be quiet  and to do noth rash  19  37 for ye have brought hither these men  which are neither robber of church  nor yet blasphem of your goddess  19  38 wherefor if demetrius  and the craftsmen which are with him  have a matter against ani man  the law is open  and there are deputi  let them implead one anoth  19  39 but if ye enquir ani thing concern other matter  it shall be determin in a law assembl  19  40 for we are in danger to be call in question for this day  s uproar  there be no caus wherebi we may give an account of this concours  19  41 and when he had thus spoken  he dismiss the assembl  20  1 and after the uproar was ceas  paul call unto him the discipl  and embrac them  and depart for to go into macedonia  20  2 and when he had gone over those part  and had given them much exhort  he came into greec  20  3 and there abod three month  and when the jew laid wait for him  as he was about to sail into syria  he purpos to return through macedonia  20  4 and there accompani him into asia sopat of berea  and of the thessalonian  aristarchus and secundus  and gaius of derb  and timotheus  and of asia  tychicus and trophimus  20  5 these go befor tarri for us at troa  20  6 and we sail away from philippi after the day of unleaven bread  and came unto them to troa in five day  where we abod seven day  20  7 and upon the first day of the week  when the discipl came togeth to break bread  paul preach unto them  readi to depart on the morrow  and continu his speech until midnight  20  8 and there were mani light in the upper chamber  where they were gather togeth  20  9 and there sat in a window a certain young man name eutychus  be fallen into a deep sleep  and as paul was long preach  he sunk down with sleep  and fell down from the third loft  and was taken up dead  20  10 and paul went down  and fell on him  and embrac him said  troubl not yourselv  for his life is in him  20  11 when he therefor was come up again  and had broken bread  and eaten  and talk a long while  even till break of day  so he depart  20  12 and they brought the young man aliv  and were not a littl comfort  20  13 and we went befor to ship  and sail unto asso  there intend to take in paul  for so had he appoint  mind himself to go afoot  20  14 and when he met with us at asso  we took him in  and came to mitylen  20  15 and we sail thenc  and came the next day over against chio  and the next day we arriv at samo  and tarri at trogyllium  and the next day we came to miletus  20  16 for paul had determin to sail by ephesus  becaus he would not spend the time in asia  for he hast  if it were possibl for him  to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost  20  17 and from miletus he sent to ephesus  and call the elder of the church  20  18 and when they were come to him  he said unto them  ye know  from the first day that i came into asia  after what manner i have been with you at all season  20  19 serv the lord with all humil of mind  and with mani tear  and temptat  which befel me by the lie in wait of the jew  20  20 and how i kept back noth that was profit unto you  but have shew you  and have taught you publick  and from hous to hous  20  21 testifi both to the jew  and also to the greek  repent toward god  and faith toward our lord jesus christ  20  22 and now  behold  i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem  not know the thing that shall befal me there  20  23 save that the holi ghost witnesseth in everi citi  say that bond and afflict abid me  20  24 but none of these thing move me  neither count i my life dear unto myself  so that i might finish my cours with joy  and the ministri  which i have receiv of the lord jesus  to testifi the gospel of the grace of god  20  25 and now  behold  i know that ye all  among whom i have gone preach the kingdom of god  shall see my face no more  20  26 wherefor i take you to record this day  that i am pure from the blood of all men  20  27 for i have not shun to declar unto you all the counsel of god  20  28 take heed therefor unto yourselv  and to all the flock  over the which the holi ghost hath made you overs  to feed the church of god  which he hath purchas with his own blood  20  29 for i know this  that after my depart shall grievous wolv enter in among you  not spare the flock  20  30 also of your own selv shall men aris  speak pervers thing  to draw away discipl after them  20  31 therefor watch  and rememb  that by the space of three year i ceas not to warn everi one night and day with tear  20  32 and now  brethren  i commend you to god  and to the word of his grace  which is abl to build you up  and to give you an inherit among all them which are sanctifi  20  33 i have covet no man  s silver  or gold  or apparel  20  34 yea  ye yourselv know  that these hand have minist unto my necess  and to them that were with me  20  35 i have shew you all thing  how that so labour ye ought to support the weak  and to rememb the word of the lord jesus  how he said  it is more bless to give than to receiv  20  36 and when he had thus spoken  he kneel down  and pray with them all  20  37 and they all wept sore  and fell on paul  s neck  and kiss him  20  38 sorrow most of all for the word which he spake  that they should see his face no more  and they accompani him unto the ship  21  1 and it came to pass  that after we were gotten from them  and had launch  we came with a straight cours unto coo  and the day follow unto rhode  and from thenc unto patara  21  2 and find a ship sail over unto phenicia  we went aboard  and set forth  21  3 now when we had discov cyprus  we left it on the left hand  and sail into syria  and land at tyre  for there the ship was to unlad her burden  21  4 and find discipl  we tarri there seven day  who said to paul through the spirit  that he should not go up to jerusalem  21  5 and when we had accomplish those day  we depart and went our way  and they all brought us on our way  with wive and children  till we were out of the citi  and we kneel down on the shore  and pray  21  6 and when we had taken our leav one of anoth  we took ship  and they return home again  21  7 and when we had finish our cours from tyre  we came to ptolemai  and salut the brethren  and abod with them one day  21  8 and the next day we that were of paul  s compani depart  and came unto caesarea  and we enter into the hous of philip the evangelist  which was one of the seven  and abod with him  21  9 and the same man had four daughter  virgin  which did prophesi  21  10 and as we tarri there mani day  there came down from judaea a certain prophet  name agabus  21  11 and when he was come unto us  he took paul  s girdl  and bound his own hand and feet  and said  thus saith the holi ghost  so shall the jew at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdl  and shall deliv him into the hand of the gentil  21  12 and when we heard these thing  both we  and they of that place  besought him not to go up to jerusalem  21  13 then paul answer  what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart  for i am readi not to be bound onli  but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus  21  14 and when he would not be persuad  we ceas  say  the will of the lord be done  21  15 and after those day we took up our carriag  and went up to jerusalem  21  16 there went with us also certain of the discipl of caesarea  and brought with them one mnason of cyprus  an old discipl  with whom we should lodg  21  17 and when we were come to jerusalem  the brethren receiv us glad  21  18 and the day follow paul went in with us unto jame  and all the elder were present  21  19 and when he had salut them  he declar particular what thing god had wrought among the gentil by his ministri  21  20 and when they heard it  they glorifi the lord  and said unto him  thou seest  brother  how mani thousand of jew there are which believ  and they are all zealous of the law  21  21 and they are inform of thee  that thou teachest all the jew which are among the gentil to forsak mose  say that they ought not to circumcis their children  neither to walk after the custom  21  22 what is it therefor  the multitud must need come togeth  for they will hear that thou art come  21  23 do therefor this that we say to thee  we have four men which have a vow on them  21  24 them take  and purifi thyself with them  and be at charg with them  that they may shave their head  and all may know that those thing  whereof they were inform concern thee  are noth  but that thou thyself also walkest order  and keepest the law  21  25 as touch the gentil which believ  we have written and conclud that they observ no such thing  save onli that they keep themselv from thing offer to idol  and from blood  and from strangl  and from fornic  21  26 then paul took the men  and the next day purifi himself with them enter into the templ  to signifi the accomplish of the day of purif  until that an offer should be offer for everi one of them  21  27 and when the seven day were almost end  the jew which were of asia  when they saw him in the templ  stir up all the peopl  and laid hand on him  21  28 cri out  men of israel  help  this is the man  that teacheth all men everi where against the peopl  and the law  and this place  and further brought greek also into the templ  and hath pollut this holi place  21  29  for they had seen befor with him in the citi trophimus an ephesian  whom they suppos that paul had brought into the templ  21  30 and all the citi was move  and the peopl ran togeth  and they took paul  and drew him out of the templ  and forthwith the door were shut  21  31 and as they went about to kill him  tide came unto the chief captain of the band  that all jerusalem was in an uproar  21  32 who immedi took soldier and centurion  and ran down unto them  and when they saw the chief captain and the soldier  they left beat of paul  21  33 then the chief captain came near  and took him  and command him to be bound with two chain  and demand who he was  and what he had done  21  34 and some cri one thing  some anoth  among the multitud  and when he could not know the certainti for the tumult  he command him to be carri into the castl  21  35 and when he came upon the stair  so it was  that he was born of the soldier for the violenc of the peopl  21  36 for the multitud of the peopl follow after  cri  away with him  21  37 and as paul was to be led into the castl  he said unto the chief captain  may i speak unto thee  who said  canst thou speak greek  21  38 art not thou that egyptian  which befor these day madest an uproar  and leddest out into the wilder four thousand men that were murder  21  39 but paul said  i am a man which am a jew of tarsus  a citi in cilicia  a citizen of no mean citi  and  i beseech thee  suffer me to speak unto the peopl  21  40 and when he had given him licenc  paul stood on the stair  and beckon with the hand unto the peopl  and when there was made a great silenc  he spake unto them in the hebrew tongu  say  22  1 men  brethren  and father  hear ye my defenc which i make now unto you  22  2  and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongu to them  they kept the more silenc  and he saith  22  3 i am verili a man which am a jew  born in tarsus  a citi in cilicia  yet brought up in this citi at the feet of gamaliel  and taught accord to the perfect manner of the law of the father  and was zealous toward god  as ye all are this day  22  4 and i persecut this way unto the death  bind and deliv into prison both men and women  22  5 as also the high priest doth bear me wit  and all the estat of the elder  from whom also i receiv letter unto the brethren  and went to damascus  to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem  for to be punish  22  6 and it came to pass  that  as i made my journey  and was come nigh unto damascus about noon  sudden there shone from heaven a great light round about me  22  7 and i fell unto the ground  and heard a voic say unto me  saul  saul  whi persecutest thou me  22  8 and i answer  who art thou  lord  and he said unto me  i am jesus of nazareth  whom thou persecutest  22  9 and they that were with me saw inde the light  and were afraid  but they heard not the voic of him that spake to me  22  10 and i said  what shall i do  lord  and the lord said unto me  aris  and go into damascus  and there it shall be told thee of all thing which are appoint for thee to do  22  11 and when i could not see for the glori of that light  be led by the hand of them that were with me  i came into damascus  22  12 and one anania  a devout man accord to the law  have a good report of all the jew which dwelt there  22  13 came unto me  and stood  and said unto me  brother saul  receiv thi sight  and the same hour i look up upon him  22  14 and he said  the god of our father hath chosen thee  that thou shouldest know his will  and see that just one  and shouldest hear the voic of his mouth  22  15 for thou shalt be his wit unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard  22  16 and now whi tarriest thou  aris  and be baptiz  and wash away thi sin  call on the name of the lord  22  17 and it came to pass  that  when i was come again to jerusalem  even while i pray in the templ  i was in a tranc  22  18 and saw him say unto me  make hast  and get thee quick out of jerusalem  for they will not receiv thi testimoni concern me  22  19 and i said  lord  they know that i imprison and beat in everi synagogu them that believ on thee  22  20 and when the blood of thi martyr stephen was shed  i also was stand by  and consent unto his death  and kept the raiment of them that slew him  22  21 and he said unto me  depart  for i will send thee far henc unto the gentil  22  22 and they gave him audienc unto this word  and then lift up their voic  and said  away with such a fellow from the earth  for it is not fit that he should live  22  23 and as they cri out  and cast off their cloth  and threw dust into the air  22  24 the chief captain command him to be brought into the castl  and bade that he should be examin by scourg  that he might know wherefor they cri so against him  22  25 and as they bound him with thong  paul said unto the centurion that stood by  is it law for you to scourg a man that is a roman  and uncondemn  22  26 when the centurion heard that  he went and told the chief captain  say  take heed what thou doest  for this man is a roman  22  27 then the chief captain came  and said unto him  tell me  art thou a roman  he said  yea  22  28 and the chief captain answer  with a great sum obtain i this freedom  and paul said  but i was free born  22  29 then straightway they depart from him which should have examin him  and the chief captain also was afraid  after he knew that he was a roman  and becaus he had bound him  22  30 on the morrow  becaus he would have known the certainti wherefor he was accus of the jew  he loos him from his band  and command the chief priest and all their council to appear  and brought paul down  and set him befor them  23  1 and paul  earnest behold the council  said  men and brethren  i have live in all good conscienc befor god until this day  23  2 and the high priest anania command them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth  23  3 then said paul unto him  god shall smite thee  thou white wall  for sittest thou to judg me after the law  and commandest me to be smitten contrari to the law  23  4 and they that stood by said  revilest thou god  s high priest  23  5 then said paul  i wist not  brethren  that he was the high priest  for it is written  thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thi peopl  23  6 but when paul perceiv that the one part were sadduce  and the other pharise  he cri out in the council  men and brethren  i am a pharise  the son of a pharise  of the hope and resurrect of the dead i am call in question  23  7 and when he had so said  there aros a dissens between the pharise and the sadduce  and the multitud was divid  23  8 for the sadduce say that there is no resurrect  neither angel  nor spirit  but the pharise confess both  23  9 and there aros a great cri  and the scribe that were of the pharise  part aros  and strove  say  we find no evil in this man  but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him  let us not fight against god  23  10 and when there aros a great dissens  the chief captain  fear lest paul should have been pull in piec of them  command the soldier to go down  and to take him by forc from among them  and to bring him into the castl  23  11 and the night follow the lord stood by him  and said  be of good cheer  paul  for as thou hast testifi of me in jerusalem  so must thou bear wit also at rome  23  12 and when it was day  certain of the jew band togeth  and bound themselv under a curs  say that they would neither eat nor drink till they had kill paul  23  13 and they were more than forti which had made this conspiraci  23  14 and they came to the chief priest and elder  and said  we have bound ourselv under a great curs  that we will eat noth until we have slain paul  23  15 now therefor ye with the council signifi to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow  as though ye would enquir someth more perfect concern him  and we  or ever he come near  are readi to kill him  23  16 and when paul  s sister  s son heard of their lie in wait  he went and enter into the castl  and told paul  23  17 then paul call one of the centurion unto him  and said  bring this young man unto the chief captain  for he hath a certain thing to tell him  23  18 so he took him  and brought him to the chief captain  and said  paul the prison call me unto him  and pray me to bring this young man unto thee  who hath someth to say unto thee  23  19 then the chief captain took him by the hand  and went with him asid privat  and ask him  what is that thou hast to tell me  23  20 and he said  the jew have agre to desir thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council  as though they would enquir somewhat of him more perfect  23  21 but do not thou yield unto them  for there lie in wait for him of them more than forti men  which have bound themselv with an oath  that they will neither eat nor drink till they have kill him  and now are they readi  look for a promis from thee  23  22 so the chief captain then let the young man depart  and charg him  see thou tell no man that thou hast shew these thing to me  23  23 and he call unto him two centurion  say  make readi two hundr soldier to go to caesarea  and horsemen threescor and ten  and spearmen two hundr  at the third hour of the night  23  24 and provid them beast  that they may set paul on  and bring him safe unto felix the governor  23  25 and he wrote a letter after this manner  23  26 claudius lysia unto the most excel governor felix sendeth greet  23  27 this man was taken of the jew  and should have been kill of them  then came i with an armi  and rescu him  have understood that he was a roman  23  28 and when i would have known the caus wherefor they accus him  i brought him forth into their council  23  29 whom i perceiv to be accus of question of their law  but to have noth laid to his charg worthi of death or of bond  23  30 and when it was told me how that the jew laid wait for the man  i sent straightway to thee  and gave command to his accus also to say befor thee what they had against him  farewel  23  31 then the soldier  as it was command them  took paul  and brought him by night to antipatri  23  32 on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him  and return to the castl  23  33 who  when they came to caesarea and deliv the epistl to the governor  present paul also befor him  23  34 and when the governor had read the letter  he ask of what provinc he was  and when he understood that he was of cilicia  23  35 i will hear thee  said he  when thine accus are also come  and he command him to be kept in herod  s judgment hall  24  1 and after five day anania the high priest descend with the elder  and with a certain orat name tertullus  who inform the governor against paul  24  2 and when he was call forth  tertullus began to accus him  say  see that by thee we enjoy great quiet  and that veri worthi deed are done unto this nation by thi provid  24  3 we accept it alway  and in all place  most nobl felix  with all thank  24  4 notwithstand  that i be not further tedious unto thee  i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thi clemenc a few word  24  5 for we have found this man a pestil fellow  and a mover of sedit among all the jew throughout the world  and a ringlead of the sect of the nazaren  24  6 who also hath gone about to profan the templ  whom we took  and would have judg accord to our law  24  7 but the chief captain lysia came upon us  and with great violenc took him away out of our hand  24  8 command his accus to come unto thee  by examin of whom thyself mayest take knowledg of all these thing  whereof we accus him  24  9 and the jew also assent  say that these thing were so  24  10 then paul  after that the governor had beckon unto him to speak  answer  forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of mani year a judg unto this nation  i do the more cheer answer for myself  24  11 becaus that thou mayest understand  that there are yet but twelv day sinc i went up to jerusalem for to worship  24  12 and they neither found me in the templ disput with ani man  neither rais up the peopl  neither in the synagogu  nor in the citi  24  13 neither can they prove the thing whereof they now accus me  24  14 but this i confess unto thee  that after the way which they call heresi  so worship i the god of my father  believ all thing which are written in the law and in the prophet  24  15 and have hope toward god  which they themselv also allow  that there shall be a resurrect of the dead  both of the just and unjust  24  16 and herein do i exercis myself  to have alway a conscienc void to offenc toward god  and toward men  24  17 now after mani year i came to bring alm to my nation  and offer  24  18 whereupon certain jew from asia found me purifi in the templ  neither with multitud  nor with tumult  24  19 who ought to have been here befor thee  and object  if they had ought against me  24  20 or els let these same here say  if they have found ani evil do in me  while i stood befor the council  24  21 except it be for this one voic  that i cri stand among them  touch the resurrect of the dead i am call in question by you this day  24  22 and when felix heard these thing  have more perfect knowledg of that way  he defer them  and said  when lysia the chief captain shall come down  i will know the uttermost of your matter  24  23 and he command a centurion to keep paul  and to let him have liberti  and that he should forbid none of his acquaint to minist or come unto him  24  24 and after certain day  when felix came with his wife drusilla  which was a jewess  he sent for paul  and heard him concern the faith in christ  24  25 and as he reason of righteous  temper  and judgment to come  felix trembl  and answer  go thi way for this time  when i have a conveni season  i will call for thee  24  26 he hope also that money should have been given him of paul  that he might loos him  wherefor he sent for him the often  and commune with him  24  27 but after two year porcius festus came into felix  room  and felix  will to shew the jew a pleasur  left paul bound  25  1 now when festus was come into the provinc  after three day he ascend from caesarea to jerusalem  25  2 then the high priest and the chief of the jew inform him against paul  and besought him  25  3 and desir favour against him  that he would send for him to jerusalem  lay wait in the way to kill him  25  4 but festus answer  that paul should be kept at caesarea  and that he himself would depart short thither  25  5 let them therefor  said he  which among you are abl  go down with me  and accus this man  if there be ani wicked in him  25  6 and when he had tarri among them more than ten day  he went down unto caesarea  and the next day sit on the judgment seat command paul to be brought  25  7 and when he was come  the jew which came down from jerusalem stood round about  and laid mani and grievous complaint against paul  which they could not prove  25  8 while he answer for himself  neither against the law of the jew  neither against the templ  nor yet against caesar  have i offend ani thing at all  25  9 but festus  will to do the jew a pleasur  answer paul  and said  wilt thou go up to jerusalem  and there be judg of these thing befor me  25  10 then said paul  i stand at caesar  s judgment seat  where i ought to be judg  to the jew have i done no wrong  as thou veri well knowest  25  11 for if i be an offend  or have commit ani thing worthi of death  i refus not to die  but if there be none of these thing whereof these accus me  no man may deliv me unto them  i appeal unto caesar  25  12 then festus  when he had confer with the council  answer  hast thou appeal unto caesar  unto caesar shalt thou go  25  13 and after certain day king agrippa and bernic came unto caesarea to salut festus  25  14 and when they had been there mani day  festus declar paul  s caus unto the king  say  there is a certain man left in bond by felix  25  15 about whom  when i was at jerusalem  the chief priest and the elder of the jew inform me  desir to have judgment against him  25  16 to whom i answer  it is not the manner of the roman to deliv ani man to die  befor that he which is accus have the accus face to face  and have licenc to answer for himself concern the crime laid against him  25  17 therefor  when they were come hither  without ani delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat  and command the man to be brought forth  25  18 against whom when the accus stood up  they brought none accus of such thing as i suppos  25  19 but had certain question against him of their own superstit  and of one jesus  which was dead  whom paul affirm to be aliv  25  20 and becaus i doubt of such manner of question  i ask him whether he would go to jerusalem  and there be judg of these matter  25  21 but when paul had appeal to be reserv unto the hear of augustus  i command him to be kept till i might send him to caesar  25  22 then agrippa said unto festus  i would also hear the man myself  to morrow  said he  thou shalt hear him  25  23 and on the morrow  when agrippa was come  and bernic  with great pomp  and was enter into the place of hear  with the chief captain  and princip men of the citi  at festus  command paul was brought forth  25  24 and festus said  king agrippa  and all men which are here present with us  ye see this man  about whom all the multitud of the jew have dealt with me  both at jerusalem  and also here  cri that he ought not to live ani longer  25  25 but when i found that he had commit noth worthi of death  and that he himself hath appeal to augustus  i have determin to send him  25  26 of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord  wherefor i have brought him forth befor you  and special befor thee  o king agrippa  that  after examin had  i might have somewhat to write  25  27 for it seemeth to me unreason to send a prison  and not withal to signifi the crime laid against him  26  1 then agrippa said unto paul  thou art permit to speak for thyself  then paul stretch forth the hand  and answer for himself  26  2 i think myself happi  king agrippa  becaus i shall answer for myself this day befor thee touch all the thing whereof i am accus of the jew  26  3 especi becaus i know thee to be expert in all custom and question which are among the jew  wherefor i beseech thee to hear me patient  26  4 my manner of life from my youth  which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem  know all the jew  26  5 which knew me from the begin  if they would testifi  that after the most straitest sect of our religion i live a pharise  26  6 and now i stand and am judg for the hope of the promis made of god  unto our father  26  7 unto which promis our twelv tribe  instant serv god day and night  hope to come  for which hope  s sake  king agrippa  i am accus of the jew  26  8 whi should it be thought a thing incred with you  that god should rais the dead  26  9 i verili thought with myself  that i ought to do mani thing contrari to the name of jesus of nazareth  26  10 which thing i also did in jerusalem  and mani of the saint did i shut up in prison  have receiv author from the chief priest  and when they were put to death  i gave my voic against them  26  11 and i punish them oft in everi synagogu  and compel them to blasphem  and be exceed mad against them  i persecut them even unto strang citi  26  12 whereupon as i went to damascus with author and commiss from the chief priest  26  13 at midday  o king  i saw in the way a light from heaven  abov the bright of the sun  shine round about me and them which journey with me  26  14 and when we were all fallen to the earth  i heard a voic speak unto me  and say in the hebrew tongu  saul  saul  whi persecutest thou me  it is hard for thee to kick against the prick  26  15 and i said  who art thou  lord  and he said  i am jesus whom thou persecutest  26  16 but rise  and stand upon thi feet  for i have appear unto thee for this purpos  to make thee a minist and a wit both of these thing which thou hast seen  and of those thing in the which i will appear unto thee  26  17 deliv thee from the peopl  and from the gentil  unto whom now i send thee  26  18 to open their eye  and to turn them from dark to light  and from the power of satan unto god  that they may receiv forgiv of sin  and inherit among them which are sanctifi by faith that is in me  26  19 whereupon  o king agrippa  i was not disobedi unto the heaven vision  26  20 but shew first unto them of damascus  and at jerusalem  and throughout all the coast of judaea  and then to the gentil  that they should repent and turn to god  and do work meet for repent  26  21 for these caus the jew caught me in the templ  and went about to kill me  26  22 have therefor obtain help of god  i continu unto this day  wit both to small and great  say none other thing than those which the prophet and mose did say should come  26  23 that christ should suffer  and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead  and should shew light unto the peopl  and to the gentil  26  24 and as he thus spake for himself  festus said with a loud voic  paul  thou art besid thyself  much learn doth make thee mad  26  25 but he said  i am not mad  most nobl festus  but speak forth the word of truth and sober  26  26 for the king knoweth of these thing  befor whom also i speak freeli  for i am persuad that none of these thing are hidden from him  for this thing was not done in a corner  26  27 king agrippa  believest thou the prophet  i know that thou believest  26  28 then agrippa said unto paul  almost thou persuadest me to be a christian  26  29 and paul said  i would to god  that not onli thou  but also all that hear me this day  were both almost  and altogeth such as i am  except these bond  26  30 and when he had thus spoken  the king rose up  and the governor  and bernic  and they that sat with them  26  31 and when they were gone asid  they talk between themselv  say  this man doeth noth worthi of death or of bond  26  32 then said agrippa unto festus  this man might have been set at liberti  if he had not appeal unto caesar  27  1 and when it was determin that we should sail into itali  they deliv paul and certain other prison unto one name julius  a centurion of augustus  band  27  2 and enter into a ship of adramyttium  we launch  mean to sail by the coast of asia  one aristarchus  a macedonian of thessalonica  be with us  27  3 and the next day we touch at sidon  and julius courteous entreat paul  and gave him liberti to go unto his friend to refresh himself  27  4 and when we had launch from thenc  we sail under cyprus  becaus the wind were contrari  27  5 and when we had sail over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia  we came to myra  a citi of lycia  27  6 and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sail into itali  and he put us therein  27  7 and when we had sail slowli mani day  and scarc were come over against cnidus  the wind not suffer us  we sail under crete  over against salmon  27  8 and  hard pass it  came unto a place which is call the fair haven  nigh whereunto was the citi of lasea  27  9 now when much time was spent  and when sail was now danger  becaus the fast was now alreadi past  paul admonish them  27  10 and said unto them  sir  i perceiv that this voyag will be with hurt and much damag  not onli of the lade and ship  but also of our live  27  11 nevertheless the centurion believ the master and the owner of the ship  more than those thing which were spoken by paul  27  12 and becaus the haven was not commodi to winter in  the more part advis to depart thenc also  if by ani mean they might attain to phenic  and there to winter  which is an haven of crete  and lieth toward the south west and north west  27  13 and when the south wind blew soft  suppos that they had obtain their purpos  loos thenc  they sail close by crete  27  14 but not long after there aros against it a tempestu wind  call euroclydon  27  15 and when the ship was caught  and could not bear up into the wind  we let her drive  27  16 and run under a certain island which is call clauda  we had much work to come by the boat  27  17 which when they had taken up  they use help  undergird the ship  and  fear lest they should fall into the quicksand  strake sail  and so were driven  27  18 and we be exceed toss with a tempest  the next day they lighten the ship  27  19 and the third day we cast out with our own hand the tackl of the ship  27  20 and when neither sun nor star in mani day appear  and no small tempest lay on us  all hope that we should be save was then taken away  27  21 but after long abstin paul stood forth in the midst of them  and said  sir  ye should have hearken unto me  and not have loos from crete  and to have gain this harm and loss  27  22 and now i exhort you to be of good cheer  for there shall be no loss of ani man  s life among you  but of the ship  27  23 for there stood by me this night the angel of god  whose i am  and whom i serv  27  24 say  fear not  paul  thou must be brought befor caesar  and  lo  god hath given thee all them that sail with thee  27  25 wherefor  sir  be of good cheer  for i believ god  that it shall be even as it was told me  27  26 howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island  27  27 but when the fourteenth night was come  as we were driven up and down in adria  about midnight the shipmen deem that they drew near to some countri  27  28 and sound  and found it twenti fathom  and when they had gone a littl further  they sound again  and found it fifteen fathom  27  29 then fear lest we should have fallen upon rock  they cast four anchor out of the stern  and wish for the day  27  30 and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship  when they had let down the boat into the sea  under colour as though they would have cast anchor out of the foreship  27  31 paul said to the centurion and to the soldier  except these abid in the ship  ye cannot be save  27  32 then the soldier cut off the rope of the boat  and let her fall off  27  33 and while the day was come on  paul besought them all to take meat  say  this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarri and continu fast  have taken noth  27  34 wherefor i pray you to take some meat  for this is for your health  for there shall not an hair fall from the head of ani of you  27  35 and when he had thus spoken  he took bread  and gave thank to god in presenc of them all  and when he had broken it  he began to eat  27  36 then were they all of good cheer  and they also took some meat  27  37 and we were in all in the ship two hundr threescor and sixteen soul  27  38 and when they had eaten enough  they lighten the ship  and cast out the wheat into the sea  27  39 and when it was day  they knew not the land  but they discov a certain creek with a shore  into the which they were mind  if it were possibl  to thrust in the ship  27  40 and when they had taken up the anchor  they commit themselv unto the sea  and loos the rudder band  and hois up the mainsail to the wind  and made toward shore  27  41 and fall into a place where two sea met  they ran the ship aground  and the forepart stuck fast  and remain unmov  but the hinder part was broken with the violenc of the wave  27  42 and the soldier  counsel was to kill the prison  lest ani of them should swim out  and escap  27  43 but the centurion  will to save paul  kept them from their purpos  and command that they which could swim should cast themselv first into the sea  and get to land  27  44 and the rest  some on board  and some on broken piec of the ship  and so it came to pass  that they escap all safe to land  28  1 and when they were escap  then they knew that the island was call melita  28  2 and the barbar peopl shew us no littl kind  for they kindl a fire  and receiv us everi one  becaus of the present rain  and becaus of the cold  28  3 and when paul had gather a bundl of stick  and laid them on the fire  there came a viper out of the heat  and fasten on his hand  28  4 and when the barbarian saw the venom beast hang on his hand  they said among themselv  no doubt this man is a murder  whom  though he hath escap the sea  yet vengeanc suffereth not to live  28  5 and he shook off the beast into the fire  and felt no harm  28  6 howbeit they look when he should have swollen  or fallen down dead sudden  but after they had look a great while  and saw no harm come to him  they chang their mind  and said that he was a god  28  7 in the same quarter were possess of the chief man of the island  whose name was publius  who receiv us  and lodg us three day courteous  28  8 and it came to pass  that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloodi flux  to whom paul enter in  and pray  and laid his hand on him  and heal him  28  9 so when this was done  other also  which had diseas in the island  came  and were heal  28  10 who also honour us with mani honour  and when we depart  they lade us with such thing as were necessari  28  11 and after three month we depart in a ship of alexandria  which had winter in the isl  whose sign was castor and pollux  28  12 and land at syracus  we tarri there three day  28  13 and from thenc we fetch a compass  and came to rhegium  and after one day the south wind blew  and we came the next day to puteoli  28  14 where we found brethren  and were desir to tarri with them seven day  and so we went toward rome  28  15 and from thenc  when the brethren heard of us  they came to meet us as far as appii forum  and the three tavern  whom when paul saw  he thank god  and took courag  28  16 and when we came to rome  the centurion deliv the prison to the captain of the guard  but paul was suffer to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him  28  17 and it came to pass  that after three day paul call the chief of the jew togeth  and when they were come togeth  he said unto them  men and brethren  though i have commit noth against the peopl  or custom of our father  yet was i deliv prison from jerusalem into the hand of the roman  28  18 who  when they had examin me  would have let me go  becaus there was no caus of death in me  28  19 but when the jew spake against it  i was constrain to appeal unto caesar  not that i had ought to accus my nation of  28  20 for this caus therefor have i call for you  to see you  and to speak with you  becaus that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain  28  21 and they said unto him  we neither receiv letter out of judaea concern thee  neither ani of the brethren that came shew or spake ani harm of thee  28  22 but we desir to hear of thee what thou thinkest  for as concern this sect  we know that everi where it is spoken against  28  23 and when they had appoint him a day  there came mani to him into his lodg  to whom he expound and testifi the kingdom of god  persuad them concern jesus  both out of the law of mose  and out of the prophet  from morn till even  28  24 and some believ the thing which were spoken  and some believ not  28  25 and when they agre not among themselv  they depart  after that paul had spoken one word  well spake the holi ghost by esaia the prophet unto our father  28  26 say  go unto this peopl  and say  hear ye shall hear  and shall not understand  and see ye shall see  and not perceiv  28  27 for the heart of this peopl is wax gross  and their ear are dull of hear  and their eye have they close  lest they should see with their eye  and hear with their ear  and understand with their heart  and should be convert  and i should heal them  28  28 be it known therefor unto you  that the salvat of god is sent unto the gentil  and that they will hear it  28  29 and when he had said these word  the jew depart  and had great reason among themselv  28  30 and paul dwelt two whole year in his own hire hous  and receiv all that came in unto him  28  31 preach the kingdom of god  and teach those thing which concern the lord jesus christ  with all confid  no man forbid him  the epistl of paul the apostl to the roman 1  1 paul  a servant of jesus christ  call to be an apostl  separ unto the gospel of god  1  2  which he had promis afor by his prophet in the holi scriptur  1  3 concern his son jesus christ our lord  which was made of the seed of david accord to the flesh  1  4 and declar to be the son of god with power  accord to the spirit of holi  by the resurrect from the dead  1  5 by whom we have receiv grace and apostleship  for obedi to the faith among all nation  for his name  1  6 among whom are ye also the call of jesus christ  1  7 to all that be in rome  belov of god  call to be saint  grace to you and peac from god our father  and the lord jesus christ  1  8 first  i thank my god through jesus christ for you all  that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world  1  9 for god is my wit  whom i serv with my spirit in the gospel of his son  that without ceas i make mention of you alway in my prayer  1  10 make request  if by ani mean now at length i might have a prosper journey by the will of god to come unto you  1  11 for i long to see you  that i may impart unto you some spiritu gift  to the end ye may be establish  1  12 that is  that i may be comfort togeth with you by the mutual faith both of you and me  1  13 now i would not have you ignor  brethren  that oftentim i purpos to come unto you   but was let hitherto  that i might have some fruit among you also  even as among other gentil  1  14 i am debtor both to the greek  and to the barbarian  both to the wise  and to the unwis  1  15 so  as much as in me is  i am readi to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also  1  16 for i am not asham of the gospel of christ  for it is the power of god unto salvat to everi one that believeth  to the jew first  and also to the greek  1  17 for therein is the righteous of god reveal from faith to faith  as it is written  the just shall live by faith  1  18 for the wrath of god is reveal from heaven against all ungodli and unright of men  who hold the truth in unright  1  19 becaus that which may be known of god is manifest in them  for god hath shew it unto them  1  20 for the invis thing of him from the creation of the world are clear seen  be understood by the thing that are made  even his etern power and godhead  so that they are without excus  1  21 becaus that  when they knew god  they glorifi him not as god  neither were thank  but becam vain in their imagin  and their foolish heart was darken  1  22 profess themselv to be wise  they becam fool  1  23 and chang the glori of the uncorrupt god into an imag made like to corrupt man  and to bird  and fourfoot beast  and creep thing  1  24 wherefor god also gave them up to unclean through the lust of their own heart  to dishonour their own bodi between themselv  1  25 who chang the truth of god into a lie  and worship and serv the creatur more than the creator  who is bless for ever  amen  1  26 for this caus god gave them up unto vile affect  for even their women did chang the natur use into that which is against natur  1  27 and likewis also the men  leav the natur use of the woman  burn in their lust one toward anoth  men with men work that which is unseem  and receiv in themselv that recomp of their error which was meet  1  28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledg  god gave them over to a reprob mind  to do those thing which are not conveni  1  29 be fill with all unright  fornic  wicked  covet  malici  full of envi  murder  debat  deceit  malign  whisper  1  30 backbit  hater of god  despit  proud  boaster  inventor of evil thing  disobedi to parent  1  31 without understand  covenantbreak  without natur affect  implac  unmerci  1  32 who know the judgment of god  that they which commit such thing are worthi of death  not onli do the same  but have pleasur in them that do them  2  1 therefor thou art inexcus  o man  whosoev thou art that judgest  for wherein thou judgest anoth  thou condemnest thyself  for thou that judgest doest the same thing  2  2 but we are sure that the judgment of god is accord to truth against them which commit such thing  2  3 and thinkest thou this  o man  that judgest them which do such thing  and doest the same  that thou shalt escap the judgment of god  2  4 or despisest thou the rich of his good and forbear and longsuff  not know that the good of god leadeth thee to repent  2  5 but after thi hard and impenit heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revel of the righteous judgment of god  2  6 who will render to everi man accord to his deed  2  7 to them who by patient continu in well do seek for glori and honour and immort  etern life  2  8 but unto them that are contenti  and do not obey the truth  but obey unright  indign and wrath  2  9 tribul and anguish  upon everi soul of man that doeth evil  of the jew first  and also of the gentil  2  10 but glori  honour  and peac  to everi man that worketh good  to the jew first  and also to the gentil  2  11 for there is no respect of person with god  2  12 for as mani as have sin without law shall also perish without law  and as mani as have sin in the law shall be judg by the law  2  13  for not the hearer of the law are just befor god  but the doer of the law shall be justifi  2  14 for when the gentil  which have not the law  do by natur the thing contain in the law  these  have not the law  are a law unto themselv  2  15 which shew the work of the law written in their heart  their conscienc also bear wit  and their thought the mean while accus or els excus one anoth  2  16 in the day when god shall judg the secret of men by jesus christ accord to my gospel  2  17 behold  thou art call a jew  and restest in the law  and makest thi boast of god  2  18 and knowest his will  and approvest the thing that are more excel  be instruct out of the law  2  19 and art confid that thou thyself art a guid of the blind  a light of them which are in dark  2  20 an instructor of the foolish  a teacher of babe  which hast the form of knowledg and of the truth in the law  2  21 thou therefor which teachest anoth  teachest thou not thyself  thou that preachest a man should not steal  dost thou steal  2  22 thou that sayest a man should not commit adulteri  dost thou commit adulteri  thou that abhorrest idol  dost thou commit sacrileg  2  23 thou that makest thi boast of the law  through break the law dishonourest thou god  2  24 for the name of god is blasphem among the gentil through you  as it is written  2  25 for circumcis verili profiteth  if thou keep the law  but if thou be a breaker of the law  thi circumcis is made uncircumcis  2  26 therefor if the uncircumcis keep the righteous of the law  shall not his uncircumcis be count for circumcis  2  27 and shall not uncircumcis which is by natur  if it fulfil the law  judg thee  who by the letter and circumcis dost transgress the law  2  28 for he is not a jew  which is one outward  neither is that circumcis  which is outward in the flesh  2  29 but he is a jew  which is one inward  and circumcis is that of the heart  in the spirit  and not in the letter  whose prais is not of men  but of god  3  1 what advantag then hath the jew  or what profit is there of circumcis  3  2 much everi way  chiefli  becaus that unto them were commit the oracl of god  3  3 for what if some did not believ  shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect  3  4 god forbid  yea  let god be true  but everi man a liar  as it is written  that thou mightest be justifi in thi say  and mightest overcom when thou art judg  3  5 but if our unright commend the righteous of god  what shall we say  is god unright who taketh vengeanc   i speak as a man  3  6 god forbid  for then how shall god judg the world  3  7 for if the truth of god hath more abound through my lie unto his glori  whi yet am i also judg as a sinner  3  8 and not rather   as we be slander report  and as some affirm that we say  let us do evil  that good may come  whose damnat is just  3  9 what then  are we better than they  no  in no wise  for we have befor prove both jew and gentil  that they are all under sin  3  10 as it is written  there is none righteous  no  not one  3  11 there is none that understandeth  there is none that seeketh after god  3  12 they are all gone out of the way  they are togeth becom unprofit  there is none that doeth good  no  not one  3  13 their throat is an open sepulchr  with their tongu they have use deceit  the poison of asp is under their lip  3  14 whose mouth is full of curs and bitter  3  15 their feet are swift to shed blood  3  16 destruct and miseri are in their way  3  17 and the way of peac have they not known  3  18 there is no fear of god befor their eye  3  19 now we know that what thing soever the law saith  it saith to them who are under the law  that everi mouth may be stop  and all the world may becom guilti befor god  3  20 therefor by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be justifi in his sight  for by the law is the knowledg of sin  3  21 but now the righteous of god without the law is manifest  be wit by the law and the prophet  3  22 even the righteous of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believ  for there is no differ  3  23 for all have sin  and come short of the glori of god  3  24 be justifi freeli by his grace through the redempt that is in christ jesus  3  25 whom god hath set forth to be a propiti through faith in his blood  to declar his righteous for the remiss of sin that are past  through the forbear of god  3  26 to declar  i say  at this time his righteous  that he might be just  and the justifi of him which believeth in jesus  3  27 where is boast then  it is exclud  by what law  of work  nay  but by the law of faith  3  28 therefor we conclud that a man is justifi by faith without the deed of the law  3  29 is he the god of the jew onli  is he not also of the gentil  yes  of the gentil also  3  30 see it is one god  which shall justifi the circumcis by faith  and uncircumcis through faith  3  31 do we then make void the law through faith  god forbid  yea  we establish the law  4  1 what shall we say then that abraham our father  as pertain to the flesh  hath found  4  2 for if abraham were justifi by work  he hath whereof to glori  but not befor god  4  3 for what saith the scriptur  abraham believ god  and it was count unto him for righteous  4  4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace  but of debt  4  5 but to him that worketh not  but believeth on him that justifieth the ungod  his faith is count for righteous  4  6 even as david also describeth the blessed of the man  unto whom god imputeth righteous without work  4  7 say  bless are they whose iniqu are forgiven  and whose sin are cover  4  8 bless is the man to whom the lord will not imput sin  4  9 cometh this blessed then upon the circumcis onli  or upon the uncircumcis also  for we say that faith was reckon to abraham for righteous  4  10 how was it then reckon  when he was in circumcis  or in uncircumcis  not in circumcis  but in uncircumcis  4  11 and he receiv the sign of circumcis  a seal of the righteous of the faith which he had yet be uncircumcis  that he might be the father of all them that believ  though they be not circumcis  that righteous might be imput unto them also  4  12 and the father of circumcis to them who are not of the circumcis onli  but who also walk in the step of that faith of our father abraham  which he had be yet uncircumcis  4  13 for the promis  that he should be the heir of the world  was not to abraham  or to his seed  through the law  but through the righteous of faith  4  14 for if they which are of the law be heir  faith is made void  and the promis made of none effect  4  15 becaus the law worketh wrath  for where no law is  there is no transgress  4  16 therefor it is of faith  that it might be by grace  to the end the promis might be sure to all the seed  not to that onli which is of the law  but to that also which is of the faith of abraham  who is the father of us all  4  17  as it is written  i have made thee a father of mani nation  befor him whom he believ  even god  who quickeneth the dead  and calleth those thing which be not as though they were  4  18 who against hope believ in hope  that he might becom the father of mani nation  accord to that which was spoken  so shall thi seed be  4  19 and be not weak in faith  he consid not his own bodi now dead  when he was about an hundr year old  neither yet the dead of sarah  s womb  4  20 he stagger not at the promis of god through unbelief  but was strong in faith  give glori to god  4  21 and be fulli persuad that  what he had promis  he was abl also to perform  4  22 and therefor it was imput to him for righteous  4  23 now it was not written for his sake alon  that it was imput to him  4  24 but for us also  to whom it shall be imput  if we believ on him that rais up jesus our lord from the dead  4  25 who was deliv for our offenc  and was rais again for our justif  5  1 therefor be justifi by faith  we have peac with god through our lord jesus christ  5  2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand  and rejoic in hope of the glori of god  5  3 and not onli so  but we glori in tribul also  know that tribul worketh patienc  5  4 and patienc  experi  and experi  hope  5  5 and hope maketh not asham  becaus the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holi ghost which is given unto us  5  6 for when we were yet without strength  in due time christ die for the ungod  5  7 for scarc for a righteous man will one die  yet peradventur for a good man some would even dare to die  5  8 but god commendeth his love toward us  in that  while we were yet sinner  christ die for us  5  9 much more then  be now justifi by his blood  we shall be save from wrath through him  5  10 for if  when we were enemi  we were reconcil to god by the death of his son  much more  be reconcil  we shall be save by his life  5  11 and not onli so  but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ  by whom we have now receiv the aton  5  12 wherefor  as by one man sin enter into the world  and death by sin  and so death pass upon all men  for that all have sin  5  13  for until the law sin was in the world  but sin is not imput when there is no law  5  14 nevertheless death reign from adam to mose  even over them that had not sin after the similitud of adam  s transgress  who is the figur of him that was to come  5  15 but not as the offenc  so also is the free gift  for if through the offenc of one mani be dead  much more the grace of god  and the gift by grace  which is by one man  jesus christ  hath abound unto mani  5  16 and not as it was by one that sin  so is the gift  for the judgment was by one to condemn  but the free gift is of mani offenc unto justif  5  17 for if by one man  s offenc death reign by one  much more they which receiv abund of grace and of the gift of righteous shall reign in life by one  jesus christ  5  18 therefor as by the offenc of one judgment came upon all men to condemn  even so by the righteous of one the free gift came upon all men unto justif of life  5  19 for as by one man  s disobedi mani were made sinner  so by the obedi of one shall mani be made righteous  5  20 moreov the law enter  that the offenc might abound  but where sin abound  grace did much more abound  5  21 that as sin hath reign unto death  even so might grace reign through righteous unto etern life by jesus christ our lord  6  1 what shall we say then  shall we continu in sin  that grace may abound  6  2 god forbid  how shall we  that are dead to sin  live ani longer therein  6  3 know ye not  that so mani of us as were baptiz into jesus christ were baptiz into his death  6  4 therefor we are buri with him by baptism into death  that like as christ was rais up from the dead by the glori of the father  even so we also should walk in new of life  6  5 for if we have been plant togeth in the like of his death  we shall be also in the like of his resurrect  6  6 know this  that our old man is crucifi with him  that the bodi of sin might be destroy  that henceforth we should not serv sin  6  7 for he that is dead is freed from sin  6  8 now if we be dead with christ  we believ that we shall also live with him  6  9 know that christ be rais from the dead dieth no more  death hath no more dominion over him  6  10 for in that he die  he die unto sin onc  but in that he liveth  he liveth unto god  6  11 likewis reckon ye also yourselv to be dead inde unto sin  but aliv unto god through jesus christ our lord  6  12 let not sin therefor reign in your mortal bodi  that ye should obey it in the lust thereof  6  13 neither yield ye your member as instrument of unright unto sin  but yield yourselv unto god  as those that are aliv from the dead  and your member as instrument of righteous unto god  6  14 for sin shall not have dominion over you  for ye are not under the law  but under grace  6  15 what then  shall we sin  becaus we are not under the law  but under grace  god forbid  6  16 know ye not  that to whom ye yield yourselv servant to obey  his servant ye are to whom ye obey  whether of sin unto death  or of obedi unto righteous  6  17 but god be thank  that ye were the servant of sin  but ye have obey from the heart that form of doctrin which was deliv you  6  18 be then made free from sin  ye becam the servant of righteous  6  19 i speak after the manner of men becaus of the infirm of your flesh  for as ye have yield your member servant to unclean and to iniqu unto iniqu  even so now yield your member servant to righteous unto holi  6  20 for when ye were the servant of sin  ye were free from righteous  6  21 what fruit had ye then in those thing whereof ye are now asham  for the end of those thing is death  6  22 but now be made free from sin  and becom servant to god  ye have your fruit unto holi  and the end everlast life  6  23 for the wage of sin is death  but the gift of god is etern life through jesus christ our lord  7  1 know ye not  brethren   for i speak to them that know the law  how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth  7  2 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth  but if the husband be dead  she is loos from the law of her husband  7  3 so then if  while her husband liveth  she be marri to anoth man  she shall be call an adulteress  but if her husband be dead  she is free from that law  so that she is no adulteress  though she be marri to anoth man  7  4 wherefor  my brethren  ye also are becom dead to the law by the bodi of christ  that ye should be marri to anoth  even to him who is rais from the dead  that we should bring forth fruit unto god  7  5 for when we were in the flesh  the motion of sin  which were by the law  did work in our member to bring forth fruit unto death  7  6 but now we are deliv from the law  that be dead wherein we were held  that we should serv in new of spirit  and not in the old of the letter  7  7 what shall we say then  is the law sin  god forbid  nay  i had not known sin  but by the law  for i had not known lust  except the law had said  thou shalt not covet  7  8 but sin  take occas by the command  wrought in me all manner of concupisc  for without the law sin was dead  7  9 for i was aliv without the law onc  but when the command came  sin reviv  and i die  7  10 and the command  which was ordain to life  i found to be unto death  7  11 for sin  take occas by the command  deceiv me  and by it slew me  7  12 wherefor the law is holi  and the command holi  and just  and good  7  13 was then that which is good made death unto me  god forbid  but sin  that it might appear sin  work death in me by that which is good  that sin by the command might becom exceed sin  7  14 for we know that the law is spiritu  but i am carnal  sold under sin  7  15 for that which i do i allow not  for what i would  that do i not  but what i hate  that do i  7  16 if then i do that which i would not  i consent unto the law that it is good  7  17 now then it is no more i that do it  but sin that dwelleth in me  7  18 for i know that in me  that is  in my flesh  dwelleth no good thing  for to will is present with me  but how to perform that which is good i find not  7  19 for the good that i would i do not  but the evil which i would not  that i do  7  20 now if i do that i would not  it is no more i that do it  but sin that dwelleth in me  7  21 i find then a law  that  when i would do good  evil is present with me  7  22 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man  7  23 but i see anoth law in my member  war against the law of my mind  and bring me into captiv to the law of sin which is in my member  7  24 o wretch man that i am  who shall deliv me from the bodi of this death  7  25 i thank god through jesus christ our lord  so then with the mind i myself serv the law of god  but with the flesh the law of sin  8  1 there is therefor now no condemn to them which are in christ jesus  who walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit  8  2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death  8  3 for what the law could not do  in that it was weak through the flesh  god send his own son in the like of sin flesh  and for sin  condemn sin in the flesh  8  4 that the righteous of the law might be fulfil in us  who walk not after the flesh  but after the spirit  8  5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the thing of the flesh  but they that are after the spirit the thing of the spirit  8  6 for to be carnal mind is death  but to be spiritu mind is life and peac  8  7 becaus the carnal mind is enmiti against god  for it is not subject to the law of god  neither inde can be  8  8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot pleas god  8  9 but ye are not in the flesh  but in the spirit  if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you  now if ani man have not the spirit of christ  he is none of his  8  10 and if christ be in you  the bodi is dead becaus of sin  but the spirit is life becaus of righteous  8  11 but if the spirit of him that rais up jesus from the dead dwell in you  he that rais up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodi by his spirit that dwelleth in you  8  12 therefor  brethren  we are debtor  not to the flesh  to live after the flesh  8  13 for if ye live after the flesh  ye shall die  but if ye through the spirit do mortifi the deed of the bodi  ye shall live  8  14 for as mani as are led by the spirit of god  they are the son of god  8  15 for ye have not receiv the spirit of bondag again to fear  but ye have receiv the spirit of adopt  wherebi we cri  abba  father  8  16 the spirit itself beareth wit with our spirit  that we are the children of god  8  17 and if children  then heir  heir of god  and joint  heir with christ  if so be that we suffer with him  that we may be also glorifi togeth  8  18 for i reckon that the suffer of this present time are not worthi to be compar with the glori which shall be reveal in us  8  19 for the earnest expect of the creatur waiteth for the manifest of the son of god  8  20 for the creatur was made subject to vaniti  not will  but by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope  8  21 becaus the creatur itself also shall be deliv from the bondag of corrupt into the glorious liberti of the children of god  8  22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain togeth until now  8  23 and not onli they  but ourselv also  which have the firstfruit of the spirit  even we ourselv groan within ourselv  wait for the adopt  to wit  the redempt of our bodi  8  24 for we are save by hope  but hope that is seen is not hope  for what a man seeth  whi doth he yet hope for  8  25 but if we hope for that we see not  then do we with patienc wait for it  8  26 likewis the spirit also helpeth our infirm  for we know not what we should pray for as we ought  but the spirit itself maketh intercess for us with groan which cannot be utter  8  27 and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit  becaus he maketh intercess for the saint accord to the will of god  8  28 and we know that all thing work togeth for good to them that love god  to them who are the call accord to his purpos  8  29 for whom he did foreknow  he also did predestin to be conform to the imag of his son  that he might be the firstborn among mani brethren  8  30 moreov whom he did predestin  them he also call  and whom he call  them he also justifi  and whom he justifi  them he also glorifi  8  31 what shall we then say to these thing  if god be for us  who can be against us  8  32 he that spare not his own son  but deliv him up for us all  how shall he not with him also freeli give us all thing  8  33 who shall lay ani thing to the charg of god  s elect  it is god that justifieth  8  34 who is he that condemneth  it is christ that die  yea rather  that is risen again  who is even at the right hand of god  who also maketh intercess for us  8  35 who shall separ us from the love of christ  shall tribul  or distress  or persecut  or famin  or naked  or peril  or sword  8  36 as it is written  for thi sake we are kill all the day long  we are account as sheep for the slaughter  8  37 nay  in all these thing we are more than conqueror through him that love us  8  38 for i am persuad  that neither death  nor life  nor angel  nor princip  nor power  nor thing present  nor thing to come  8  39 nor height  nor depth  nor ani other creatur  shall be abl to separ us from the love of god  which is in christ jesus our lord  9  1 i say the truth in christ  i lie not  my conscienc also bear me wit in the holi ghost  9  2 that i have great heavi and continu sorrow in my heart  9  3 for i could wish that myself were accurs from christ for my brethren  my kinsmen accord to the flesh  9  4 who are israelit  to whom pertaineth the adopt  and the glori  and the coven  and the give of the law  and the servic of god  and the promis  9  5 whose are the father  and of whom as concern the flesh christ came  who is over all  god bless for ever  amen  9  6 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect  for they are not all israel  which are of israel  9  7 neither  becaus they are the seed of abraham  are they all children  but  in isaac shall thi seed be call  9  8 that is  they which are the children of the flesh  these are not the children of god  but the children of the promis are count for the seed  9  9 for this is the word of promis  at this time will i come  and sarah shall have a son  9  10 and not onli this  but when rebecca also had conceiv by one  even by our father isaac  9  11  for the children be not yet born  neither have done ani good or evil  that the purpos of god accord to elect might stand  not of work  but of him that calleth  9  12 it was said unto her  the elder shall serv the younger  9  13 as it is written  jacob have i love  but esau have i hate  9  14 what shall we say then  is there unright with god  god forbid  9  15 for he saith to mose  i will have merci on whom i will have merci  and i will have compass on whom i will have compass  9  16 so then it is not of him that willeth  nor of him that runneth  but of god that sheweth merci  9  17 for the scriptur saith unto pharaoh  even for this same purpos have i rais thee up  that i might shew my power in thee  and that my name might be declar throughout all the earth  9  18 therefor hath he merci on whom he will have merci  and whom he will he hardeneth  9  19 thou wilt say then unto me  whi doth he yet find fault  for who hath resist his will  9  20 nay but  o man  who art thou that repliest against god  shall the thing form say to him that form it  whi hast thou made me thus  9  21 hath not the potter power over the clay  of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour  and anoth unto dishonour  9  22 what if god  will to shew his wrath  and to make his power known  endur with much longsuff the vessel of wrath fit to destruct  9  23 and that he might make known the rich of his glori on the vessel of merci  which he had afor prepar unto glori  9  24 even us  whom he hath call  not of the jew onli  but also of the gentil  9  25 as he saith also in ose  i will call them my peopl  which were not my peopl  and her belov  which was not belov  9  26 and it shall come to pass  that in the place where it was said unto them  ye are not my peopl  there shall they be call the children of the live god  9  27 esaia also crieth concern israel  though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea  a remnant shall be save  9  28 for he will finish the work  and cut it short in righteous  becaus a short work will the lord make upon the earth  9  29 and as esaia said befor  except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed  we had been as sodoma  and been made like unto gomorrha  9  30 what shall we say then  that the gentil  which follow not after righteous  have attain to righteous  even the righteous which is of faith  9  31 but israel  which follow after the law of righteous  hath not attain to the law of righteous  9  32 wherefor  becaus they sought it not by faith  but as it were by the work of the law  for they stumbl at that stumblingston  9  33 as it is written  behold  i lay in sion a stumblingston and rock of offenc  and whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham  10  1 brethren  my heart  s desir and prayer to god for israel is  that they might be save  10  2 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god  but not accord to knowledg  10  3 for they be ignor of god  s righteous  and go about to establish their own righteous  have not submit themselv unto the righteous of god  10  4 for christ is the end of the law for righteous to everi one that believeth  10  5 for mose describeth the righteous which is of the law  that the man which doeth those thing shall live by them  10  6 but the righteous which is of faith speaketh on this wise  say not in thine heart  who shall ascend into heaven   that is  to bring christ down from abov  10  7 or  who shall descend into the deep   that is  to bring up christ again from the dead  10  8 but what saith it  the word is nigh thee  even in thi mouth  and in thi heart  that is  the word of faith  which we preach  10  9 that if thou shalt confess with thi mouth the lord jesus  and shalt believ in thine heart that god hath rais him from the dead  thou shalt be save  10  10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteous  and with the mouth confess is made unto salvat  10  11 for the scriptur saith  whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham  10  12 for there is no differ between the jew and the greek  for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him  10  13 for whosoev shall call upon the name of the lord shall be save  10  14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believ  and how shall they believ in him of whom they have not heard  and how shall they hear without a preacher  10  15 and how shall they preach  except they be sent  as it is written  how beauti are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peac  and bring glad tide of good thing  10  16 but they have not all obey the gospel  for esaia saith  lord  who hath believ our report  10  17 so then faith cometh by hear  and hear by the word of god  10  18 but i say  have they not heard  yes verili  their sound went into all the earth  and their word unto the end of the world  10  19 but i say  did not israel know  first mose saith  i will provok you to jealousi by them that are no peopl  and by a foolish nation i will anger you  10  20 but esaia is veri bold  and saith  i was found of them that sought me not  i was made manifest unto them that ask not after me  10  21 but to israel he saith  all day long i have stretch forth my hand unto a disobedi and gainsay peopl  11  1 i say then  hath god cast away his peopl  god forbid  for i also am an israelit  of the seed of abraham  of the tribe of benjamin  11  2 god hath not cast away his peopl which he foreknew  wot ye not what the scriptur saith of elia  how he maketh intercess to god against israel say  11  3 lord  they have kill thi prophet  and dig down thine altar  and i am left alon  and they seek my life  11  4 but what saith the answer of god unto him  i have reserv to myself seven thousand men  who have not bow the knee to the imag of baal  11  5 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant accord to the elect of grace  11  6 and if by grace  then is it no more of work  otherwis grace is no more grace  but if it be of work  then it is no more grace  otherwis work is no more work  11  7 what then  israel hath not obtain that which he seeketh for  but the elect hath obtain it  and the rest were blind  11  8  accord as it is written  god hath given them the spirit of slumber  eye that they should not see  and ear that they should not hear  unto this day  11  9 and david saith  let their tabl be made a snare  and a trap  and a stumblingblock  and a recomp unto them  11  10 let their eye be darken  that they may not see  and bow down their back alway  11  11 i say then  have they stumbl that they should fall  god forbid  but rather through their fall salvat is come unto the gentil  for to provok them to jealousi  11  12 now if the fall of them be the rich of the world  and the diminish of them the rich of the gentil  how much more their ful  11  13 for i speak to you gentil  inasmuch as i am the apostl of the gentil  i magnifi mine offic  11  14 if by ani mean i may provok to emul them which are my flesh  and might save some of them  11  15 for if the cast away of them be the reconcil of the world  what shall the receiv of them be  but life from the dead  11  16 for if the firstfruit be holi  the lump is also holi  and if the root be holi  so are the branch  11  17 and if some of the branch be broken off  and thou  be a wild oliv tree  wert graf in among them  and with them partakest of the root and fat of the oliv tree  11  18 boast not against the branch  but if thou boast  thou bearest not the root  but the root thee  11  19 thou wilt say then  the branch were broken off  that i might be graf in  11  20 well  becaus of unbelief they were broken off  and thou standest by faith  be not highmind  but fear  11  21 for if god spare not the natur branch  take heed lest he also spare not thee  11  22 behold therefor the good and sever of god  on them which fell  sever  but toward thee  good  if thou continu in his good  otherwis thou also shalt be cut off  11  23 and they also  if they abid not still in unbelief  shall be graf in  for god is abl to graff them in again  11  24 for if thou wert cut out of the oliv tree which is wild by natur  and wert graf contrari to natur into a good oliv tree  how much more shall these  which be the natur branch  be graf into their own oliv tree  11  25 for i would not  brethren  that ye should be ignor of this mysteri  lest ye should be wise in your own conceit  that blind in part is happen to israel  until the ful of the gentil be come in  11  26 and so all israel shall be save  as it is written  there shall come out of sion the deliver  and shall turn away ungodli from jacob  11  27 for this is my coven unto them  when i shall take

30 for as ye in time past have not believ god  yet have now obtain merci through their unbelief  11  31 even so have these also now not believ  that through your merci they also may obtain merci  11  32 for god hath conclud them all in unbelief  that he might have merci upon all  11  33 o the depth of the rich both of the wisdom and knowledg of god  how unsearch are his judgment  and his way past find out  11  34 for who hath known the mind of the lord  or who hath been his counsellor  11  35 or who hath first given to him  and it shall be recompens unto him again  11  36 for of him  and

of faith  12  4 for as we have mani member in one bodi  and all member have not the same offic  12  5 so we  be mani  are one bodi in christ  and everi one member one of anoth  12  6 have then gift differ accord to the grace that is given to us  whether propheci  let us prophesi accord to the proport of faith  12  7 or ministri  let us wait on our minist  or he that teacheth  on teach  12  8 or he that exhorteth  on exhort  he that giveth  let him do it with simplic  he that ruleth  with dilig  he that sheweth merci  with cheer  12  9 let love be without dissimul  abhor that which is evil  cleav to that which is good  12  10 be kind affect one to anoth with brother love  in honour prefer one anoth  12  11 not sloth in busi  fervent in spirit  serv the lord  12  12 rejoic in hope

rejoic  and weep with them that weep  12  16 be of the same mind one toward anoth  mind not high thing  but condescend to men of low estat  be not wise in your own conceit  12  17 recompens to no man evil for evil  provid thing honest in the sight of all men  12  18 if it be possibl  as much as lieth in you  live peaceabl with all men  12  19 dear belov  aveng not yourselv  but rather give place unto wrath  for it is written  vengeanc is mine  i will repay  saith the lord  12  20 therefor if thine enemi hunger  feed him  if he thirst  give him drink  for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire on his head  12  21 be not overcom of evil  but overcom evil with good  13  1 let everi soul be subject unto the higher power  for there is no power but of god  the power that be are ordain of god  13  2 whosoev therefor resisteth the power  resisteth the ordin of god  and they that resist shall receiv to themselv damnat  13  3 for ruler are not a terror to good work  but to the evil  wilt thou then not be afraid of the power  do that which is good  and thou shalt have prais of the same  13  4 for he is the minist of god to thee for good  but if thou do that which is evil  be afraid  for he beareth not the sword in vain  for he is the minist of god  a reveng to execut wrath upon him that doeth evil  13  5 wherefor ye must need be subject  not onli for wrath  but also for conscienc sake  13  6 for for this caus pay ye tribut also  for they are god  s minist  attend continu upon this veri thing  13  7 render therefor to all their due  tribut to whom tribut is due  custom to whom custom  fear to whom fear  honour to whom honour  13  8 owe no man ani thing  but to love one anoth  for he that loveth anoth hath fulfil the law  13  9 for this  thou shalt not commit adulteri  thou shalt not kill  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not bear fals wit  thou shalt not covet  and if there be ani other command  it is briefli comprehend in this say  name  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  13  10 love worketh no ill to his neighbour  therefor love is the fulfil of the law  13  11 and that  know the time  that now it is high time to awak out of sleep  for now is our salvat nearer than when we believ  13  12 the night is far spent  the day is at hand  let us therefor cast off the work of dark  and let us put on the armour of light  13  13 let us walk honest  as in the day  not in riot and drunken  not in chamber and wanton  not in strife and envi  13  14 but put ye on the lord jesus christ  and make not provis for the flesh  to fulfil the lust thereof  14  1 him that is weak in the faith receiv ye  but not to doubt disput  14  2 for one believeth that he may eat all thing  anoth  who is weak  eateth herb  14  3 let not him that eateth despis him that eateth not  and let not him which eateth not judg him that eateth  for god hath receiv him  14  4 who art thou that judgest anoth man  s servant  to his own master he standeth or falleth  yea  he shall be holden up  for god is abl to make him stand  14  5 one man esteemeth one day abov anoth  anoth esteemeth everi day alik  let everi man be fulli persuad in his own mind  14  6 he that regardeth the day  regardeth it unto the lord  and he that regardeth not the day  to the lord he doth not regard it  he that eateth  eateth to the lord  for he giveth god thank  and he that eateth not  to the lord he eateth not  and giveth god thank  14  7 for none of us liveth to himself  and no man dieth to himself  14  8 for whether we live  we live unto the lord  and whether we die  we die unto the lord  whether we live therefor  or die  we are the lord  s  14  9 for to this end christ both die  and rose  and reviv  that he might be lord both of the dead and live  14  10 but whi dost thou judg thi brother  or whi dost thou set at nought thi brother  for we shall all stand befor the judgment seat of christ  14  11 for it is written  as i live  saith the lord  everi knee shall bow to me  and everi tongu shall confess to god  14  12 so then everi one of us shall give account of himself to god  14  13 let us not therefor judg one anoth ani more  but judg this rather  that no man put a stumblingblock or an occas to fall in his brother  s way  14  14 i know  and am persuad by the lord jesus  that there is noth unclean of itself  but to him that esteemeth ani thing to be unclean  to him it is unclean  14  15 but if thi brother be griev with thi meat  now walkest thou not charit  destroy not him with thi meat  for whom christ die  14  16 let not then your good be evil spoken of  14  17 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink  but righteous  and peac  and joy in the holi ghost  14  18 for he that in these thing serveth christ is accept to god  and approv of men  14  19 let us therefor follow after the thing which make for peac  and thing wherewith one may edifi anoth  14  20 for meat destroy not the work of god  all thing inde are pure  but it is evil for that man who eateth with offenc  14  21 it is good neither to eat flesh  nor to drink wine  nor ani thing wherebi thi brother stumbleth  or is offend  or is made weak  14  22 hast thou faith  have it to thyself befor god  happi is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth  14  23 and he that doubteth is damn if he eat  becaus he eateth not of faith  for whatsoev is not of faith is sin  15  1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirm of the weak  and not to pleas ourselv  15  2 let everi one of us pleas his neighbour for his good to edif  15  3 for even christ pleas not himself  but  as it is written  the reproach of them that reproach thee fell on me  15  4 for whatsoev thing were written aforetim were written for our learn  that we through patienc and comfort of the scriptur might have hope  15  5 now the god of patienc and consol grant you to be likemind one toward anoth accord to christ jesus  15  6 that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorifi god  even the father of our lord jesus christ  15  7 wherefor receiv ye one anoth  as christ also receiv us to the glori of god  15  8 now i say that jesus christ was a minist of the circumcis for the truth of god  to confirm the promis made unto the father  15  9 and that the gentil might glorifi god for his merci  as it is written  for this caus i will confess to thee among the gentil  and sing unto thi name  15  10 and again he saith  rejoic  ye gentil  with his peopl  15  11 and again  prais the lord  all ye gentil  and laud him  all ye peopl  15  12 and again  esaia saith  there shall be a root of jess  and he that shall rise to reign over the gentil  in him shall the gentil trust  15  13 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peac in believ  that ye may abound in hope  through the power of the holi ghost  15  14 and i myself also am persuad of you  my brethren  that ye also are full of good  fill with all knowledg  abl also to admonish one anoth  15  15 nevertheless  brethren  i have written the more bold unto you in some sort  as put you in mind  becaus of the grace that is given to me of god  15  16 that i should be the minist of jesus christ to the gentil  minist the gospel of god  that the offer up of the gentil might be accept  be sanctifi by the holi ghost  15  17 i have therefor whereof i may glori through jesus christ in those thing which pertain to god  15  18 for i will not dare to speak of ani of those thing which christ hath not wrought by me  to make the gentil obedi  by word and deed  15  19 through mighti sign and wonder  by the power of the spirit of god  so that from jerusalem  and round about unto illyricum  i have fulli preach the gospel of christ  15  20 yea  so have i strive to preach the gospel  not where christ was name  lest i should build upon anoth man  s foundat  15  21 but as it is written  to whom he was not spoken of  they shall see  and they that have not heard shall understand  15  22 for which caus also i have been much hinder from come to you  15  23 but now have no more place in these part  and have a great desir these mani year to come unto you  15  24 whensoev i take my journey into spain  i will

the gentil have been made partak of their spiritu thing  their duti is also to minist unto them in carnal thing  15  28 when therefor i have perform this  and have seal to them this fruit  i will come by you into spain  15  29 and i am sure that  when i come unto you  i shall come in the ful of the bless of the gospel of christ  15  30 now i beseech you  brethren  for the lord jesus christ  s sake  and for the love of the spirit  that ye strive togeth with me in your prayer to god for me  15  31 that i may be deliv from them that do not believ in judaea  and that my servic which i have for jerusalem may be accept of the saint  15  32 that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god  and may with you be refresh  15  33 now the god of peac be with you all  amen  16  1 i commend unto

god onli wise  be glori through jesus christ for ever  amen  the first epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian 1  1 paul call to be an apostl of jesus christ through the will of god  and sosthen our brother  1  2 unto the church of god which is at corinth  to them that are sanctifi in christ jesus  call to be saint  with all that in everi place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord  both their  s and our  s  1  3 grace be unto you  and peac  from god our father  and from the lord jesus christ  1  4 i thank my god alway on your behalf  for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ  1  5 that in everi thing ye are enrich by him  in all utter  and in all knowledg  1  6 even as the testimoni of christ was confirm in you  1  7 so that ye come behind in no gift  wait for the come of our lord jesus christ  1  8 who shall also confirm you unto the end  that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ  1  9 god is faith  by whom ye were call unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord  1  10 now i beseech you  brethren  by the name of our lord jesus christ  that ye all speak the same thing  and that there be no divis among you  but that ye be perfect join togeth in the same mind and in the same judgment  1  11 for it hath been declar unto me of you  my brethren  by them which are of the hous of chloe  that there are content among you  1  12 now this i say  that everi one of you saith  i am of paul  and i of apollo  and i of cepha  and i of christ  1  13 is christ divid  was paul crucifi for you  or were ye baptiz in the name of paul  1  14 i thank god that i baptiz none of you  but crispus and gaius  1  15 lest ani should say that i had baptiz in mine own name  1  16 and i baptiz also the household of stephana  besid  i know not whether i baptiz ani other  1  17 for christ sent me not to baptiz  but to preach the gospel  not with wisdom of word  lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect  1  18 for the preach of the cross is to them that perish foolish  but unto us which are save it is the power of god  1  19 for it is written  i will destroy the wisdom of the wise  and will bring to noth the understand of the prudent  1  20 where is the wise  where is the scribe  where is the disput of this world  hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world  1  21 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god  it pleas god by the foolish of preach to save them that believ  1  22 for the jew requir a sign  and the greek seek after wisdom  1  23 but we preach christ crucifi  unto the jew a stumblingblock  and unto the greek foolish  1  24 but unto them which are call  both jew and greek  christ the power of god  and the wisdom of god  1  25 becaus the foolish of god is wiser than men  and the weak of god is stronger than men  1  26 for ye see your call  brethren  how that not mani wise men after the flesh  not mani mighti  not mani nobl  are call  1  27 but god hath chosen the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise  and god hath chosen the weak thing of the world to confound the thing which are mighti  1  28 and base thing of the world  and thing which are despis  hath god chosen  yea  and thing which are not  to bring to nought thing that are  1  29 that no flesh should glori in his presenc  1  30 but of him are ye in christ jesus  who of god is made unto us wisdom  and righteous  and sanctif  and redempt  1  31 that  accord as it is written  he that glorieth  let him glori in the lord  2  1 and i  brethren  when i came to you  came not with excel of speech or of wisdom  declar unto you the testimoni of god  2  2 for i determin not to know ani thing among you  save jesus christ  and him crucifi  2  3 and i was with you in weak  and in fear  and in much trembl  2  4 and my speech and my preach was not with entic word of man  s wisdom  but in demonstr of the spirit and of power  2  5 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men  but in the power of god  2  6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect  yet not the wisdom of this world  nor of the princ of this world  that come to nought  2  7 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mysteri  even the hidden wisdom  which god ordain befor the world unto our glori  2  8 which none of the princ of this world knew  for had they known it  they would not have crucifi the lord of glori  2  9 but as it is written  eye hath not seen  nor ear heard  neither have enter into the heart of man  the thing which god hath prepar for them that love him  2  10 but god hath reveal them unto us by his spirit  for the spirit searcheth all thing  yea  the deep thing of god  2  11 for what man knoweth the thing of a man  save the spirit of man which is in him  even so the thing of god knoweth no man  but the spirit of god  2  12 now we have receiv  not the spirit of the world  but the spirit which is of god  that we might know the thing that are freeli given to us of god  2  13 which thing also we speak  not in the word which man  s wisdom teacheth  but which the holi ghost teacheth  compar spiritu thing with spiritu  2  14 but the natur man receiveth not the thing of the spirit of god  for they are foolish unto him  neither can he know them  becaus they are spiritu discern  2  15 but he that is spiritu judgeth all thing  yet he himself is judg of no man  2  16 for who hath known the mind of the lord  that he may instruct him  but we have the mind of christ  3  1 and i  brethren  could not speak unto you as unto spiritu  but as unto carnal  even as unto babe in christ  3  2 i have fed you with milk  and not with meat  for hitherto ye were not abl to bear it  neither yet now are ye abl  3  3 for ye are yet carnal  for wherea there is among you envi  and strife  and divis  are ye not carnal  and walk as men  3  4 for while one saith  i am of paul  and anoth  i am of apollo  are ye not carnal  3  5 who then is paul  and who is apollo  but minist by whom ye believ  even as the lord gave to everi man  3  6 i have plant  apollo water  but god gave the increas  3  7 so then neither is he that planteth ani thing  neither he that watereth  but god that giveth the increas  3  8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one  and everi man shall receiv his own reward accord to his own labour  3  9 for we are labour togeth with god  ye are god  s husbandri  ye are god  s build  3  10 accord to the grace of god which is given unto me  as a wise masterbuild  i have laid the foundat  and anoth buildeth thereon  but let everi man take heed how he buildeth thereupon  3  11 for other foundat can no man lay than that is laid  which is jesus christ  3  12 now if ani man build upon this foundat gold  silver  precious stone  wood  hay  stubbl  3  13 everi man  s work shall be made manifest  for the day shall declar it  becaus it shall be reveal by fire  and the fire shall tri everi man  s work of what sort it is  3  14 if ani man  s work abid which he hath built thereupon  he shall receiv a reward  3  15 if ani man  s work shall be burn  he shall suffer loss  but he himself shall be save  yet so as by fire  3  16 know ye not that ye are the templ of god  and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you  3  17 if ani man defil the templ of god  him shall god destroy  for the templ of god is holi  which templ ye are  3  18 let no man deceiv himself  if ani man among you seemeth to be wise in this world  let him becom a fool  that he may be wise  3  19 for the wisdom of this world is foolish with god  for it is written  he taketh the wise in their own crafti  3  20 and again  the lord knoweth the thought of the wise  that they are vain  3  21 therefor let no man glori in men  for all thing are your  s  3  22 whether paul  or apollo  or cepha  or the world  or life  or death  or thing present  or thing to come  all are your  s  3  23 and ye are christ  s  and christ is god  s  4  1 let a man so account of us  as of the minist of christ  and steward of the mysteri of god  4  2 moreov it is requir in steward  that a man be found faith  4  3 but with me it is a veri small thing that i should be judg of you  or of man  s judgment  yea  i judg not mine own self  4  4 for i know noth by myself  yet am i not herebi justifi  but he that judgeth me is the lord  4  5 therefor judg noth befor the time  until the lord come  who both will bring to light the hidden thing of dark  and will make manifest the counsel of the heart  and then shall everi man have prais of god  4  6 and these thing  brethren  i have in a figur transfer to myself and to apollo for your sake  that ye might learn in us not to think of men abov that which is written  that no one of you be puf up for one against anoth  4  7 for who maketh thee to differ from anoth  and what hast thou that thou didst not receiv  now if thou didst receiv it  whi dost thou glori  as if thou hadst not receiv it  4  8 now ye are full  now ye are rich  ye have reign as king without us  and i would to god ye did reign  that we also might reign with you  4  9 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostl last  as it were appoint to death  for we are made a spectacl unto the world  and to angel  and to men  4  10 we are fool for christ  s sake  but ye are wise in christ  we are weak  but ye are strong  ye are honour  but we are despis  4  11 even unto this present hour we both hunger  and thirst  and are nake  and are buffet  and have no certain dwellingplac  4  12 and labour  work with our own hand  be revil  we bless  be persecut  we suffer it  4  13 be defam  we intreat  we are made as the filth of the world  and are the offscour of all thing unto this day  4  14 i write not these thing to shame you  but as my belov son i warn you  4  15 for though ye have ten thousand instruct in christ  yet have ye not mani father  for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel  4  16 wherefor i beseech you  be ye follow of me  4  17 for this caus have i sent unto you timotheus  who is my belov son  and faith in the lord  who shall bring you into remembr of my way which be in christ  as i teach everi where in everi church  4  18 now some are puf up  as though i would not come to you  4  19 but i will come to you short  if the lord will  and will know  not the speech of them which are puf up  but the power  4  20 for the kingdom of god is not in word  but in power  4  21 what will ye  shall i come unto you with a rod  or in love  and in the spirit of meek  5  1 it is report common that there is fornic among you  and such fornic as is not so much as name among the gentil  that one should have his father  s wife  5  2 and ye are puf up  and have not rather mourn  that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you  5  3 for i verili  as absent in bodi  but present in spirit  have judg alreadi  as though i were present  concern him that hath so done this deed  5  4 in the name of our lord jesus christ  when ye are gather togeth  and my spirit  with the power of our lord jesus christ  5  5 to deliv such an one unto satan for the destruct of the flesh  that the spirit may be save in the day of the lord jesus  5  6 your glori is not good  know ye not that a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump  5  7 purg out therefor the old leaven  that ye may be a new lump  as ye are unleaven  for even christ our passov is sacrif for us  5  8 therefor let us keep the feast  not with old leaven  neither with the leaven of malic and wicked  but with the unleaven bread of sincer and truth  5  9 i wrote unto you in an epistl not to compani with fornic  5  10 yet not altogeth with the fornic of this world  or with the covet  or extortion  or with idolat  for then must ye need go out of the world  5  11 but now i have written unto you not to keep compani  if ani man that is call a brother be a fornic  or covet  or an idolat  or a railer  or a drunkard  or an extortion  with such an one no not to eat  5  12 for what have i to do to judg them also that are without  do not ye judg them that are within  5  13 but them that are without god judgeth  therefor put away from among yourselv that wick person  6  1 dare ani of you  have a matter against anoth  go to law befor the unjust  and not befor the saint  6  2 do ye not know that the saint shall judg the world  and if the world shall be judg by you  are ye unworthi to judg the smallest matter  6  3 know ye not that we shall judg angel  how much more thing that pertain to this life  6  4 if then ye have judgment of thing pertain to this life  set them to judg who are least esteem in the church  6  5 i speak to your shame  is it so  that there is not a wise man among you  no  not one that shall be abl to judg between his brethren  6  6 but brother goeth to law with brother  and that befor the unbeliev  6  7 now therefor there is utter a fault among you  becaus ye go to law one with anoth  whi do ye not rather take wrong  whi do ye not rather suffer yourselv to be defraud  6  8 nay  ye do wrong  and defraud  and that your brethren  6  9 know ye not that the unright shall not inherit the kingdom of god  be not deceiv  neither fornic  nor idolat  nor adulter  nor effemin  nor abus of themselv with mankind  6  10 nor thiev  nor covet  nor drunkard  nor revil  nor extortion  shall inherit the kingdom of god  6  11 and such were some of you  but ye are wash  but ye are sanctifi  but ye are justifi in the name of the lord jesus  and by the spirit of our god  6  12 all thing are law unto me  but all thing are not expedi  all thing are law for me  but i will not be brought under the power of ani  6  13 meat for the belli  and the belli for meat  but god shall destroy both it and them  now the bodi is not for fornic  but for the lord  and the lord for the bodi  6  14 and god hath both rais up the lord  and will also rais up us by his own power  6  15 know ye not that your bodi are the member of christ  shall i then take the member of christ  and make them the member of an harlot  god forbid  6  16 what  know ye not that he which is join to an harlot is one bodi  for two  saith he  shall be one flesh  6  17 but he that is join unto the lord is one spirit  6  18 flee fornic  everi sin that a man doeth is without the bodi  but he that committeth fornic sinneth against his own bodi  6  19 what  know ye not that your bodi is the templ of the holi ghost which is in you  which ye have of god  and ye are not your own  6  20 for ye are bought with a price  therefor glorifi god in your bodi  and in your spirit  which are god  s  7  1 now concern the thing whereof ye wrote unto me  it is good for a man not to touch a woman  7  2 nevertheless  to avoid fornic  let everi man have his own wife  and let everi woman have her own husband  7  3 let the husband render unto the wife due benevol  and likewis also the wife unto the husband  7  4 the wife hath not power of her own bodi  but the husband  and likewis also the husband hath not power of his own bodi  but the wife  7  5 defraud ye not one the other  except it be with consent for a time  that ye may give yourselv to fast and prayer  and come togeth again  that satan tempt you not for your incontin  7  6 but i speak this by permiss  and not of command  7  7 for i would that all men were even as i myself  but everi man hath his proper gift of god  one after this manner  and anoth after that  7  8 i say therefor to the unmarri and widow  it is good for them if they abid even as i  7  9 but if they cannot contain  let them marri  for it is better to marri than to burn  7  10 and unto the marri i command  yet not i  but the lord  let not the wife depart from her husband  7  11 but and if she depart  let her remain unmarri or be reconcil to her husband  and let not the husband put away his wife  7  12 but to the rest speak i  not the lord  if ani brother hath a wife that believeth not  and she be pleas to dwell with him  let him not put her away  7  13 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not  and if he be pleas to dwell with her  let her not leav him  7  14 for the unbeliev husband is sanctifi by the wife  and the unbeliev wife is sanctifi by the husband  els were your children unclean  but now are they holi  7  15 but if the unbeliev depart  let him depart  a brother or a sister is not under bondag in such case  but god hath call us to peac  7  16 for what knowest thou  o wife  whether thou shalt save thi husband  or how knowest thou  o man  whether thou shalt save thi wife  7  17 but as god hath distribut to everi man  as the lord hath call everi one  so let him walk  and so ordain i in all church  7  18 is ani man call be circumcis  let him not becom uncircumcis  is ani call in uncircumcis  let him not be circumcis  7  19 circumcis is noth  and uncircumcis is noth  but the keep of the command of god  7  20 let everi man abid in the same call wherein he was call  7  21 art thou call be a servant  care not for it  but if thou mayest be made free  use it rather  7  22 for he that is call in the lord  be a servant  is the lord  s freeman  likewis also he that is call  be free  is christ  s servant  7  23 ye are bought with a price  be not ye the servant of men  7  24 brethren  let everi man  wherein he is call  therein abid with god  7  25 now concern virgin i have no command of the lord  yet i give my judgment  as one that hath obtain merci of the lord to be faith  7  26 i suppos therefor that this is good for the present distress  i say  that it is good for a man so to be  7  27 art thou bound unto a wife  seek not to be loos  art thou loos from a wife  seek not a wife  7  28 but and if thou marri  thou hast not sin  and if a virgin marri  she hath not sin  nevertheless such shall have troubl in the flesh  but i spare you  7  29 but this i say  brethren  the time is short  it remaineth  that both they that have wive be as though they had none  7  30 and they that weep  as though they wept not  and they that rejoic  as though they rejoic not  and they that buy  as though they possess not  7  31 and they that use this world  as not abus it  for the fashion of this world passeth away  7  32 but i would have you without care  he that is unmarri careth for the thing that belong to the lord  how he may pleas the lord  7  33 but he that is marri careth for the thing that are of the world  how he may pleas his wife  7  34 there is differ also between a wife and a virgin  the unmarri woman careth for the thing of the lord  that she may be holi both in bodi and in spirit  but she that is marri careth for the thing of the world  how she may pleas her husband  7  35 and this i speak for your own profit  not that i may cast a snare upon you  but for that which is come  and that ye may attend upon the lord without distract  7  36 but if ani man think that he behaveth himself uncom toward his virgin  if she pass the flower of her age  and need so requir  let him do what he will  he sinneth not  let them marri  7  37 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart  have no necess  but hath power over his own will  and hath so decre in his heart that he will keep his virgin  doeth well  7  38 so then he that giveth her in marriag doeth well  but he that giveth her not in marriag doeth better  7  39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth  but if her husband be dead  she is at liberti to be marri to whom she will  onli in the lord  7  40 but she is happier if she so abid  after my judgment  and i think also that i have the spirit of god  8  1 now as touch thing offer unto idol  we know that we all have knowledg  knowledg puffeth up  but chariti edifieth  8  2 and if ani man think that he knoweth ani thing  he knoweth noth yet as he ought to know  8  3 but if ani man love god  the same is known of him  8  4 as concern therefor the eat of those thing that are offer in sacrific unto idol  we know that an idol is noth in the world  and that there is none other god but one  8  5 for though there be that are call god  whether in heaven or in earth   as there be god mani  and lord mani  8  6 but to us there is but one god  the father  of whom are all thing  and we in him  and one lord jesus christ  by whom are all thing  and we by him  8  7 howbeit there is not in everi man that knowledg  for some with conscienc of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offer unto an idol  and their conscienc be weak is defil  8  8 but meat commendeth us not to god  for neither  if we eat  are we the better  neither  if we eat not  are we the wors  8  9 but take heed lest by ani mean this liberti of your  s becom a stumblingblock to them that are weak  8  10 for if ani man see thee which hast knowledg sit at meat in the idol  s templ  shall not the conscienc of him which is weak be embolden to eat those thing which are offer to idol  8  11 and through thi knowledg shall the weak brother perish  for whom christ die  8  12 but when ye sin so against the brethren  and wound their weak conscienc  ye sin against christ  8  13 wherefor  if meat make my brother to offend  i will eat no flesh while the world standeth  lest i make my brother to offend  9  1 am i not an apostl  am i not free  have i not seen jesus christ our lord  are not ye my work in the lord  9  2 if i be not an apostl unto other  yet doubtless i am to you  for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord  9  3 mine answer to them that do examin me is this  9  4 have we not power to eat and to drink  9  5 have we not power to lead about a sister  a wife  as well as other apostl  and as the brethren of the lord  and cepha  9  6 or i onli and barnaba  have not we power to forbear work  9  7 who goeth a warfar ani time at his own charg  who planteth a vineyard  and eateth not of the fruit thereof  or who feedeth a flock  and eateth not of the milk of the flock  9  8 say i these thing as a man  or saith not the law the same also  9  9 for it is written in the law of mose  thou shalt not muzzl the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn  doth god take care for oxen  9  10 or saith he it altogeth for our sake  for our sake  no doubt  this is written  that he that ploweth should plow in hope  and that he that thresheth in hope should be partak of his hope  9  11 if we have sown unto you spiritu thing  is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal thing  9  12 if other be partak of this power over you  are not we rather  nevertheless we have not use this power  but suffer all thing  lest we should hinder the gospel of christ  9  13 do ye not know that they which minist about holi thing live of the thing of the templ  and they which wait at the altar are partak with the altar  9  14 even so hath the lord ordain that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel  9  15 but i have use none of these thing  neither have i written these thing  that it should be so done unto me  for it were better for me to die  than that ani man should make my glori void  9  16 for though i preach the gospel  i have noth to glori of  for necess is laid upon me  yea  woe is unto me  if i preach not the gospel  9  17 for if i do this thing will  i have a reward  but if against my will  a dispens of the gospel is commit unto me  9  18 what is my reward then  verili that  when i preach the gospel  i may make the gospel of christ without charg  that i abus not my power in the gospel  9  19 for though i be free from all men  yet have i made myself servant unto all  that i might gain the more  9  20 and unto the jew i becam as a jew  that i might gain the jew  to them that are under the law  as under the law  that i might gain them that are under the law  9  21 to them that are without law  as without law   be not without law to god  but under the law to christ  that i might gain them that are without law  9  22 to the weak becam i as weak  that i might gain the weak  i am made all thing to all men  that i might by all mean save some  9  23 and this i do for the gospel  s sake  that i might be partak thereof with you  9  24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all  but one receiveth the prize  so run  that ye may obtain  9  25 and everi man that striveth for the masteri is temper in all thing  now they do it to obtain a corrupt crown  but we an incorrupt  9  26 i therefor so run  not as uncertain  so fight i  not as one that beateth the air  9  27 but i keep under my bodi  and bring it into subject  lest that by ani mean  when i have preach to other  i myself should be a castaway  10  1 moreov  brethren  i would not that ye should be ignor  how that all our father were under the cloud  and all pass through the sea  10  2 and were all baptiz unto mose in the cloud and in the sea  10  3 and did all eat the same spiritu meat  10  4 and did all drink the same spiritu drink  for they drank of that spiritu rock that follow them  and that rock was christ  10  5 but with mani of them god was not well pleas  for they were overthrown in the wilder  10  6 now these thing were our exampl  to the intent we should not lust after evil thing  as they also lust  10  7 neither be ye idolat  as were some of them  as it is written  the peopl sat down to eat and drink  and rose up to play  10  8 neither let us commit fornic  as some of them commit  and fell in one day three and twenti thousand  10  9 neither let us tempt christ  as some of them also tempt  and were destroy of serpent  10  10 neither murmur ye  as some of them also murmur  and were destroy of the destroy  10  11 now all these thing happen unto them for ensampl  and they are written for our admonit  upon whom the end of the world are come  10  12 wherefor let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall  10  13 there hath no temptat taken you but such as is common to man  but god is faith  who will not suffer you to be tempt abov that ye are abl  but will with the temptat also make a way to escap  that ye may be abl to bear it  10  14 wherefor  my dear belov  flee from idolatri  10  15 i speak as to wise men  judg ye what i say  10  16 the cup of bless which we bless  is it not the communion of the blood of christ  the bread which we break  is it not the communion of the bodi of christ  10  17 for we be mani are one bread  and one bodi  for we are all partak of that one bread  10  18 behold israel after the flesh  are not they which eat of the sacrific partak of the altar  10  19 what say i then  that the idol is ani thing  or that which is offer in sacrific to idol is ani thing  10  20 but i say  that the thing which the gentil sacrific  they sacrific to devil  and not to god  and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devil  10  21 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord  and the cup of devil  ye cannot be partak of the lord  s tabl  and of the tabl of devil  10  22 do we provok the lord to jealousi  are we stronger than he  10  23 all thing are law for me  but all thing are not expedi  all thing are law for me  but all thing edifi not  10  24 let no man seek his own  but everi man anoth  s wealth  10  25 whatsoev is sold in the shambl  that eat  ask no question for conscienc sake  10  26 for the earth is the lord  s  and the ful thereof  10  27 if ani of them that believ not bid you to a feast  and ye be dispos to go  whatsoev is set befor you  eat  ask no question for conscienc sake  10  28 but if ani man say unto you  this is offer in sacrific unto idol  eat not for his sake that shew it  and for conscienc sake  for the earth is the lord  s  and the ful thereof  10  29 conscienc  i say  not thine own  but of the other  for whi is my liberti judg of anoth man  s conscienc  10  30 for if i by grace be a partak  whi am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thank  10  31 whether therefor ye eat  or drink  or whatsoev ye do  do all to the glori of god  10  32 give none offenc  neither to the jew  nor to the gentil  nor to the church of god  10  33 even as i pleas all men in all thing  not seek mine own profit  but the profit of mani  that they may be save  11  1 be ye follow of me  even as i also am of christ  11  2 now i prais you  brethren  that ye rememb me in all thing  and keep the ordin  as i deliv them to you  11  3 but i would have you know  that the head of everi man is christ  and the head of the woman is the man  and the head of christ is god  11  4 everi man pray or prophesi  have his head cover  dishonoureth his head  11  5 but everi woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncov dishonoureth her head  for that is even all one as if she were shaven  11  6 for if the woman be not cover  let her also be shorn  but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven  let her be cover  11  7 for a man inde ought not to cover his head  forasmuch as he is the imag and glori of god  but the woman is the glori of the man  11  8 for the man is not of the woman  but the woman of the man  11  9 neither was the man creat for the woman  but the woman for the man  11  10 for this caus ought the woman to have power on her head becaus of the angel  11  11 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman  neither the woman without the man  in the lord  11  12 for as the woman is of the man  even so is the man also by the woman  but all thing of god  11  13 judg in yourselv  is it come that a woman pray unto god uncov  11  14 doth not even natur itself teach you  that  if a man have long hair  it is a shame unto him  11  15 but if a woman have long hair  it is a glori to her  for her hair is given her for a cover  11  16 but if ani man seem to be contenti  we have no such custom  neither the church of god  11  17 now in this that i declar unto you i prais you not  that ye come togeth not for the better  but for the wors  11  18 for first of all  when ye come togeth in the church  i hear that there be divis among you  and i part believ it  11  19 for there must be also heresi among you  that they which are approv may be made manifest among you  11  20 when ye come togeth therefor into one place  this is not to eat the lord  s supper  11  21 for in eat everi one taketh befor other his own supper  and one is hungri  and anoth is drunken  11  22 what  have ye not hous to eat and to drink in  or despis ye the church of god  and shame them that have not  what shall i say to you  shall i prais you in this  i prais you not  11  23 for i have receiv of the lord that which also i deliv unto you  that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betray took bread  11  24 and when he had given thank  he brake it  and said  take  eat  this is my bodi  which is broken for you  this do in remembr of me  11  25 after the same manner also he took the cup  when he had sup  say  this cup is the new testament in my blood  this do ye  as oft as ye drink it  in remembr of me  11  26 for as often as ye eat this bread  and drink this cup  ye do shew the lord  s death till he come  11  27 wherefor whosoev shall eat this bread  and drink this cup of the lord  unworthili  shall be guilti of the bodi and blood of the lord  11  28 but let a man examin himself  and so let him eat of that bread  and drink of that cup  11  29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthili  eateth and drinketh damnat to himself  not discern the lord  s bodi  11  30 for this caus mani are weak and sick among you  and mani sleep  11  31 for if we would judg ourselv  we should not be judg  11  32 but when we are judg  we are chasten of the lord  that we should not be condemn with the world  11  33 wherefor  my brethren  when ye come togeth to eat  tarri one for anoth  11  34 and if ani man hunger  let him eat at home  that ye come not togeth unto condemn  and the rest will i set in order when i come  12  1 now concern spiritu gift  brethren  i would not have you ignor  12  2 ye know that ye were gentil  carri away unto these dumb idol  even as ye were led  12  3 wherefor i give you to understand  that no man speak by the spirit of god calleth jesus accurs  and that no man can say that jesus is the lord  but by the holi ghost  12  4 now there are divers of gift  but the same spirit  12  5 and there are differ of administr  but the same lord  12  6 and there are divers of oper  but it is the same god which worketh all in all  12  7 but the manifest of the spirit is given to everi man to profit withal  12  8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom  to anoth the word of knowledg by the same spirit  12  9 to anoth faith by the same spirit  to anoth the gift of heal by the same spirit  12  10 to anoth the work of miracl  to anoth propheci  to anoth discern of spirit  to anoth diver kind of tongu  to anoth the interpret of tongu  12  11 but all these worketh that one and the selfsam spirit  divid to everi man sever as he will  12  12 for as the bodi is one  and hath mani member  and all the member of that one bodi  be mani  are one bodi  so also is christ  12  13 for by one spirit are we all baptiz into one bodi  whether we be jew or gentil  whether we be bond or free  and have been all made to drink into one spirit  12  14 for the bodi is not one member  but mani  12  15 if the foot shall say  becaus i am not the hand  i am not of the bodi  is it therefor not of the bodi  12  16 and if the ear shall say  becaus i am not the eye  i am not of the bodi  is it therefor not of the bodi  12  17 if the whole bodi were an eye  where were the hear  if the whole were hear  where were the smell  12  18 but now hath god set the member everi one of them in the bodi  as it hath pleas him  12  19 and if they were all one member  where were the bodi  12  20 but now are they mani member  yet but one bodi  12  21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand  i have no need of thee  nor again the head to the feet  i have no need of you  12  22 nay  much more those member of the bodi  which seem to be more feebl  are necessari  12  23 and those member of the bodi  which we think to be less honour  upon these we bestow more abund honour  and our uncom part have more abund comeli  12  24 for our come part have no need  but god hath temper the bodi togeth  have given more abund honour to that part which lack  12  25 that there should be no schism in the bodi  but that the member should have the same care one for anoth  12  26 and whether one member suffer  all the member suffer with it  or one member be honour  all the member rejoic with it  12  27 now ye are the bodi of christ  and member in particular  12  28 and god hath set some in the church  first apostl  secondarili prophet  third teacher  after that miracl  then gift of heal  help  govern  divers of tongu  12  29 are all apostl  are all prophet  are all teacher  are all worker of miracl  12  30 have all the gift of heal  do all speak with tongu  do all interpret  12  31 but covet earnest the best gift  and yet shew i unto you a more excel way  13  1 though i speak with the tongu of men and of angel  and have not chariti  i am becom as sound brass  or a tinkl cymbal  13  2 and though i have the gift of propheci  and understand all mysteri  and all knowledg  and though i have all faith  so that i could remov mountain  and have not chariti  i am noth  13  3 and though i bestow all my good to feed the poor  and though i give my bodi to be burn  and have not chariti  it profiteth me noth  13  4 chariti suffereth long  and is kind  chariti envieth not  chariti vaunteth not itself  is not puf up  13  5 doth not behav itself unseem  seeketh not her own  is not easili provok  thinketh no evil  13  6 rejoiceth not in iniqu  but rejoiceth in the truth  13  7 beareth all thing  believeth all thing  hopeth all thing  endureth all thing  13  8 chariti never faileth  but whether there be propheci  they shall fail  whether there be tongu  they shall ceas  whether there be knowledg  it shall vanish away  13  9 for we know in part  and we prophesi in part  13  10 but when that which is perfect is come  then that which is in part shall be done away  13  11 when i was a child  i spake as a child  i understood as a child  i thought as a child  but when i becam a man  i put away childish thing  13  12 for now we see through a glass  dark  but then face to face  now i know in part  but then shall i know even as also i am known  13  13 and now abideth faith  hope  chariti  these three  but the greatest of these is chariti  14  1 follow after chariti  and desir spiritu gift  but rather that ye may prophesi  14  2 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongu speaketh not unto men  but unto god  for no man understandeth him  howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteri  14  3 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edif  and exhort  and comfort  14  4 he that speaketh in an unknown tongu edifieth himself  but he that prophesieth edifieth the church  14  5 i would that ye all spake with tongu but rather that ye prophesi  for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongu  except he interpret  that the church may receiv edifi  14  6 now  brethren  if i come unto you speak with tongu  what shall i profit you  except i shall speak to you either by revel  or by knowledg  or by prophesi  or by doctrin  14  7 and even thing without life give sound  whether pipe or harp  except they give a distinct in the sound  how shall it be known what is pipe or harp  14  8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound  who shall prepar himself to the battl  14  9 so likewis ye  except ye utter by the tongu word easi to be understood  how shall it be known what is spoken  for ye shall speak into the air  14  10 there are  it may be  so mani kind of voic in the world  and none of them is without signif  14  11 therefor if i know not the mean of the voic  i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian  and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me  14  12 even so ye  forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritu gift  seek that ye may excel to the edifi of the church  14  13 wherefor let him that speaketh in an unknown tongu pray that he may interpret  14  14 for if i pray in an unknown tongu  my spirit prayeth  but my understand is unfruit  14  15 what is it then  i will pray with the spirit  and i will pray with the understand also  i will sing with the spirit  and i will sing with the understand also  14  16 els when thou shalt bless with the spirit  how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearn say amen at thi give of thank  see he understandeth not what thou sayest  14  17 for thou verili givest thank well  but the other is not edifi  14  18 i thank my god  i speak with tongu more than ye all  14  19 yet in the church i had rather speak five word with my understand  that by my voic i might teach other also  than ten thousand word in an unknown tongu  14  20 brethren  be not children in understand  howbeit in malic be ye children  but in understand be men  14  21 in the law it is written  with men of other tongu and other lip will i speak unto this peopl  and yet for all that will they not hear me  saith the lord  14  22 wherefor tongu are for a sign  not to them that believ  but to them that believ not  but prophesi serveth not for them that believ not  but for them which believ  14  23 if therefor the whole church be come togeth into one place  and all speak with tongu  and there come in those that are unlearn  or unbeliev  will they not say that ye are mad  14  24 but if all prophesi  and there come in one that believeth not  or one unlearn  he is convinc of all  he is judg of all  14  25 and thus are the secret of his heart made manifest  and so fall down on his face he will worship god  and report that god is in you of a truth  14  26 how is it then  brethren  when ye come togeth  everi one of you hath a psalm  hath a doctrin  hath a tongu  hath a revel  hath an interpret  let all thing be done unto edifi  14  27 if ani man speak in an unknown tongu  let it be by two  or at the most by three  and that by cours  and let one interpret  14  28 but if there be no interpret  let him keep silenc in the church  and let him speak to himself  and to god  14  29 let the prophet speak two or three  and let the other judg  14  30 if ani thing be reveal to anoth that sitteth by  let the first hold his peac  14  31 for ye may all prophesi one by one  that all may learn  and all may be comfort  14  32 and the spirit of the prophet are subject to the prophet  14  33 for god is not the author of confus  but of peac  as in all church of the saint  14  34 let your women keep silenc in the church  for it is not permit unto them to speak  but they are command to be under obedi as also saith the law  14  35 and if they will learn ani thing  let them ask their husband at home  for it is a shame for women to speak in the church  14  36 what  came the word of god out from you  or came it unto you onli  14  37 if ani man think himself to be a prophet  or spiritu  let him acknowledg that the thing that i write unto you are the command of the lord  14  38 but if ani man be ignor  let him be ignor  14  39 wherefor  brethren  covet to prophesi  and forbid not to speak with tongu  14  40 let all thing be done decent and in order  15  1 moreov  brethren  i declar unto you the gospel which i preach unto you  which also ye have receiv  and wherein ye stand  15  2 by which also ye are save  if ye keep in memori what i preach unto you  unless ye have believ in vain  15  3 for i deliv unto you first of all that which i also receiv  how that christ die for our sin accord to the scriptur  15  4 and that he was buri  and that he rose again the third day accord to the scriptur  15  5 and that he was seen of cepha  then of the twelv  15  6 after that  he was seen of abov five hundr brethren at onc  of whom the greater part remain unto this present  but some are fallen asleep  15  7 after that  he was seen of jame  then of all the apostl  15  8 and last of all he was seen of me also  as of one born out of due time  15  9 for i am the least of the apostl  that am not meet to be call an apostl  becaus i persecut the church of god  15  10 but by the grace of god i am what i am  and his grace which was bestow upon me was not in vain  but i labour more abund than they all  yet not i  but the grace of god which was with me  15  11 therefor whether it were i or they  so we preach  and so ye believ  15  12 now if christ be preach that he rose from the dead  how say some among you that there is no resurrect of the dead  15  13 but if there be no resurrect of the dead  then is christ not risen  15  14 and if christ be not risen  then is our preach vain  and your faith is also vain  15  15 yea  and we are found fals wit of god  becaus we have testifi of god that he rais up christ  whom he rais not up  if so be that the dead rise not  15  16 for if the dead rise not  then is not christ rais  15  17 and if christ be not rais  your faith is vain  ye are yet in your sin  15  18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perish  15  19 if in this life onli we have hope in christ  we are of all men most miser  15  20 but now is christ risen from the dead  and becom the firstfruit of them that slept  15  21 for sinc by man came death  by man came also the resurrect of the dead  15  22 for as in adam all die  even so in christ shall all be made aliv  15  23 but everi man in his own order  christ the firstfruit  afterward they that are christ  s at his come  15  24 then cometh the end  when he shall have deliv up the kingdom to god  even the father  when he shall have put down all rule and all author and power  15  25 for he must reign  till he hath put all enemi under his feet  15  26 the last enemi that shall be destroy is death  15  27 for he hath put all thing under his feet  but when he saith all thing are put under him  it is manifest that he is except  which did put all thing under him  15  28 and when all thing shall be subdu unto him  then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all thing under him  that god may be all in all  15  29 els what shall they do which are baptiz for the dead  if the dead rise not at all  whi are they then baptiz for the dead  15  30 and whi stand we in jeopardi everi hour  15  31 i protest by your rejoic which i have in christ jesus our lord  i die daili  15  32 if after the manner of men i have fought with beast at ephesus  what advantageth it me  if the dead rise not  let us eat and drink  for to morrow we die  15  33 be not deceiv  evil communic corrupt good manner  15  34 awak to righteous  and sin not  for some have not the knowledg of god  i speak this to your shame  15  35 but some man will say  how are the dead rais up  and with what bodi do they come  15  36 thou fool  that which thou sowest is not quicken  except it die  15  37 and that which thou sowest  thou sowest not that bodi that shall be  but bare grain  it may chanc of wheat  or of some other grain  15  38 but god giveth it a bodi as it hath pleas him  and to everi seed his own bodi  15  39 all flesh is not the same flesh  but there is one kind of flesh of men  anoth flesh of beast  anoth of fish  and anoth of bird  15  40 there are also celesti bodi  and bodi terrestri  but the glori of the celesti is one  and the glori of the terrestri is anoth  15  41 there is one glori of the sun  and anoth glori of the moon  and anoth glori of the star  for one star differeth from anoth star in glori  15  42 so also is the resurrect of the dead  it is sown in corrupt  it is rais in incorrupt  15  43 it is sown in dishonour  it is rais in glori  it is sown in weak  it is rais in power  15  44 it is sown a natur bodi  it is rais a spiritu bodi  there is a natur bodi  and there is a spiritu bodi  15  45 and so it is written  the first man adam was made a live soul  the last adam was made a quicken spirit  15  46 howbeit that was not first which is spiritu  but that which is natur  and afterward that which is spiritu  15  47 the first man is of the earth  earthi  the second man is the lord from heaven  15  48 as is the earthi  such are they also that are earthi  and as is the heaven  such are they also that are heaven  15  49 and as we have born the imag of the earthi  we shall also bear the imag of the heaven  15  50 now this i say  brethren  that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god  neither doth corrupt inherit incorrupt  15  51 behold  i shew you a mysteri  we shall not all sleep  but we shall all be chang  15  52 in a moment  in the twinkl of an eye  at the last trump  for the trumpet shall sound  and the dead shall be rais incorrupt  and we shall be chang  15  53 for this corrupt must put on incorrupt  and this mortal must put on immort  15  54 so when this corrupt shall have put on incorrupt  and this mortal shall have put on immort  then shall be brought to pass the say that is written  death is swallow up in victori  15  55 o death  where is thi sting  o grave  where is thi victori  15  56 the sting of death is sin  and the strength of sin is the law  15  57 but thank be to god  which giveth us the victori through our lord jesus christ  15  58 therefor  my belov brethren  be ye stedfast  unmov  alway abound in the work of the lord  forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord  16  1 now concern the collect for the saint  as i have given order to the church of galatia  even so do ye  16  2 upon the first day of the week let everi one of you lay by him in store  as god hath prosper him  that there be no gather when i come  16  3 and when i come  whomsoev ye shall approv by your letter  them will i send to bring your liber unto jerusalem  16  4 and if it be meet that i go also  they shall go with me  16  5 now i will come unto you  when i shall pass through macedonia  for i do pass through macedonia  16  6 and it may be that i will abid  yea  and winter with you  that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoev i go  16  7 for i will not see you now by the way  but i trust to tarri a while with you  if the lord permit  16  8 but i will tarri at ephesus until pentecost  16  9 for a great door and effectu is open unto me  and there are mani adversari  16  10 now if timotheus come  see that he may be with you without fear  for he worketh the work of the lord  as i also do  16  11 let no man therefor despis him  but conduct him forth in peac  that he may come unto me  for i look for him with the brethren  16  12 as touch our brother apollo  i great desir him to come unto you with the brethren  but his will was not at all to come at this time  but he will come when he shall have conveni time  16  13 watch ye  stand fast in the faith  quit you like men  be strong  16  14 let all your thing be done with chariti  16  15 i beseech you  brethren   ye know the hous of stephana  that it is the firstfruit of achaia  and that they have addict themselv to the ministri of the saint  16  16 that ye submit yourselv unto such  and to everi one that helpeth with us  and laboureth  16  17 i am glad of the come of stephana and fortunatus and achaicus  for that which was lack on your part they have suppli  16  18 for they have refresh my spirit and your  s  therefor acknowledg ye them that are such  16  19 the church of asia salut you  aquila and priscilla salut you much in the lord  with the church that is in their hous  16  20 all the brethren greet you  greet ye one anoth with an holi kiss  16  21 the salut of me paul with mine own hand  16  22 if ani man love not the lord jesus christ  let him be anathema maranatha  16  23 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you  16  24 my love be with you all in christ jesus  amen  the second epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian 1  1 paul  an apostl of jesus christ by the will of god  and timothi our brother  unto the church of god which is at corinth  with all the saint which are in all achaia  1  2 grace be to you and peac from god our father  and from the lord jesus christ  1  3 bless be god  even the father of our lord jesus christ  the father of merci  and the god of all comfort  1  4 who comforteth us in all our tribul  that we may be abl to comfort them which are in ani troubl  by the comfort wherewith we ourselv are comfort of god  1  5 for as the suffer of christ abound in us  so our consol also aboundeth by christ  1  6 and whether we be afflict  it is for your consol and salvat  which is effectu in the endur of the same suffer which we also suffer  or whether we be comfort  it is for your consol and salvat  1  7 and our hope of you is stedfast  know  that as ye are partak of the suffer  so shall ye be also of the consol  1  8 for we would not  brethren  have you ignor of our troubl which came to us in asia  that we were press out of measur  abov strength  insomuch that we despair even of life  1  9 but we had the sentenc of death in ourselv  that we should not trust in ourselv  but in god which raiseth the dead  1  10 who deliv us from so great a death  and doth deliv  in whom we trust that he will yet deliv us  1  11 ye also help togeth by prayer for us  that for the gift bestow upon us by the mean of mani person thank may be given by mani on our behalf  1  12 for our rejoic is this  the testimoni of our conscienc  that in simplic and god sincer  not with flesh wisdom  but by the grace of god  we have had our convers in the world  and more abund to you  ward  1  13 for we write none other thing unto you  than what ye read or acknowledg  and i trust ye shall acknowledg even to the end  1  14 as also ye have acknowledg us in part  that we are your rejoic  even as ye also are our  s in the day of the lord jesus  1  15 and in this confid i was mind to come unto you befor  that ye might have a second benefit  1  16 and to pass by you into macedonia  and to come again out of macedonia unto you  and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea  1  17 when i therefor was thus mind  did i use light  or the thing that i purpos  do i purpos accord to the flesh  that with me there should be yea yea  and nay nay  1  18 but as god is true  our word toward you was not yea and nay  1  19 for the son of god  jesus christ  who was preach among you by us  even by me and silvanus and timotheus  was not yea and nay  but in him was yea  1  20 for all the promis of god in him are yea  and in him amen  unto the glori of god by us  1  21 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ  and hath anoint us  is god  1  22 who hath also seal us  and given the earnest of the spirit in our heart  1  23 moreov i call god for a record upon my soul  that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth  1  24 not for that we have dominion over your faith  but are helper of your joy  for by faith ye stand  2  1 but i determin this with myself  that i would not come again to you in heavi  2  2 for if i make you sorri  who is he then that maketh me glad  but the same which is made sorri by me  2  3 and i wrote this same unto you  lest  when i came  i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoic  have confid in you all  that my joy is the joy of you all  2  4 for out of much afflict and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with mani tear  not that ye should be griev  but that ye might know the love which i have more abund unto you  2  5 but if ani have caus grief  he hath not griev me  but in part  that i may not overcharg you all  2  6 suffici to such a man is this punish  which was inflict of mani  2  7 so that contrariwis ye ought rather to forgiv him  and comfort him  lest perhap such a one should be swallow up with overmuch sorrow  2  8 wherefor i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him  2  9 for to this end also did i write  that i might know the proof of you  whether ye be obedi in all thing  2  10 to whom ye forgiv ani thing  i forgiv also  for if i forgav ani thing  to whom i forgav it  for your sake forgav i it in the person of christ  2  11 lest satan should get an advantag of us  for we are not ignor of his devic  2  12 furthermor  when i came to troa to preach christ  s gospel  and a door was open unto me of the lord  2  13 i had no rest in my spirit  becaus i found not titus my brother  but take my leav of them  i went from thenc into macedonia  2  14 now thank be unto god  which alway causeth us to triumph in christ  and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledg by us in everi place  2  15 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ  in them that are save  and in them that perish  2  16 to the one we are the savour of death unto death  and to the other the savour of life unto life  and who is suffici for these thing  2  17 for we are not as mani  which corrupt the word of god  but as of sincer  but as of god  in the sight of god speak we in christ  3  1 do we begin again to commend ourselv  or need we  as some other  epistl of commend to you  or letter of commend from you  3  2 ye are our epistl written in our heart  known and read of all men  3  3 forasmuch as ye are manifest declar to be the epistl of christ minist by us  written not with ink  but with the spirit of the live god  not in tabl of stone  but in fleshi tabl of the heart  3  4 and such trust have we through christ to god  ward  3  5 not that we are suffici of ourselv to think ani thing as of ourselv  but our suffici is of god  3  6 who also hath made us abl minist of the new testament  not of the letter  but of the spirit  for the letter killeth  but the spirit giveth life  3  7 but if the ministr of death  written and engraven in stone  was glorious  so that the children of israel could not stedfast behold the face of mose for the glori of his counten  which glori was to be done away  3  8 how shall not the ministr of the spirit be rather glorious  3  9 for if the ministr of condemn be glori  much more doth the ministr of righteous exceed in glori  3  10 for even that which was made glorious had no glori in this respect  by reason of the glori that excelleth  3  11 for if that which is done away was glorious  much more that which remaineth is glorious  3  12 see then that we have such hope  we use great plain of speech  3  13 and not as mose  which put a vail over his face  that the children of israel could not stedfast look to the end of that which is abolish  3  14 but their mind were blind  for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the read of the old testament  which vail is done away in christ  3  15 but even unto this day  when mose is read  the vail is upon their heart  3  16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord  the vail shall be taken away  3  17 now the lord is that spirit  and where the spirit of the lord is  there is liberti  3  18 but we all  with open face behold as in a glass the glori of the lord  are chang into the same imag from glori to glori  even as by the spirit of the lord  4  1 therefor see we have this ministri  as we have receiv merci  we faint not  4  2 but have renounc the hidden thing of dishonesti  not walk in crafti  nor handl the word of god deceit  but by manifest of the truth commend ourselv to everi man  s conscienc in the sight of god  4  3 but if our gospel be hid  it is hid to them that are lost  4  4 in whom the god of this world hath blind the mind of them which believ not  lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ  who is the imag of god  should shine unto them  4  5 for we preach not ourselv  but christ jesus the lord  and ourselv your servant for jesus  sake  4  6 for god  who command the light to shine out of dark  hath shine in our heart  to give the light of the knowledg of the glori of god in the face of jesus christ  4  7 but we have this treasur in earthen vessel  that the excel of the power may be of god  and not of us  4  8 we are troubl on everi side  yet not distress  we are perplex  but not in despair  4  9 persecut  but not forsaken  cast down  but not destroy  4  10 alway bear about in the bodi the die of the lord jesus  that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our bodi  4  11 for we which live are alway deliv unto death for jesus  sake  that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh  4  12 so then death worketh in us  but life in you  4  13 we have the same spirit of faith  accord as it is written  i believ  and therefor have i spoken  we also believ  and therefor speak  4  14 know that he which rais up the lord jesus shall rais up us also by jesus  and shall present us with you  4  15 for all thing are for your sake  that the abund grace might through the thanksgiv of mani redound to the glori of god  4  16 for which caus we faint not  but though our outward man perish  yet the inward man is renew day by day  4  17 for our light afflict  which is but for a moment  worketh for us a far more exceed and etern weight of glori  4  18 while we look not at the thing which are seen  but at the thing which are not seen  for the thing which are seen are tempor  but the thing which are not seen are etern  5  1 for we know that if our earth hous of this tabernacl were dissolv  we have a build of god  an hous not made with hand  etern in the heaven  5  2 for in this we groan  earnest desir to be cloth upon with our hous which is from heaven  5  3 if so be that be cloth we shall not be found nake  5  4 for we that are in this tabernacl do groan  be burden  not for that we would be uncloth  but cloth upon  that mortal might be swallow up of life  5  5 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsam thing is god  who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit  5  6 therefor we are alway confid  know that  whilst we are at home in the bodi  we are absent from the lord  5  7  for we walk by faith  not by sight  5  8 we are confid  i say  and will rather to be absent from the bodi  and to be present with the lord  5  9 wherefor we labour  that  whether present or absent  we may be accept of him  5  10 for we must all appear befor the judgment seat of christ  that everi one may receiv the thing done in his bodi  accord to that he hath done  whether it be good or bad  5  11 know therefor the terror of the lord  we persuad men  but we are made manifest unto god  and i trust also are made manifest in your conscienc  5  12 for we commend not ourselv again unto you  but give you occas to glori on our behalf  that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glori in appear  and not in heart  5  13 for whether we be besid ourselv  it is to god  or whether we be sober  it is for your caus  5  14 for the love of christ constraineth us  becaus we thus judg  that if one die for all  then were all dead  5  15 and that he die for all  that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselv  but unto him which die for them  and rose again  5  16 wherefor henceforth know we no man after the flesh  yea  though we have known christ after the flesh  yet now henceforth know we him no more  5  17 therefor if ani man be in christ  he is a new creatur  old thing are pass away  behold  all thing are becom new  5  18 and all thing are of god  who hath reconcil us to himself by jesus christ  and hath given to us the ministri of reconcili  5  19 to wit  that god was in christ  reconcil the world unto himself  not imput their trespass unto them  and hath commit unto us the word of reconcili  5  20 now then we are ambassador for christ  as though god did beseech you by us  we pray you in christ  s stead  be ye reconcil to god  5  21 for he hath made him to be sin for us  who knew no sin  that we might be made the righteous of god in him  6  1 we then  as worker togeth with him  beseech you also that ye receiv not the grace of god in vain  6  2  for he saith  i have heard thee in a time accept  and in the day of salvat have i succour thee  behold  now is the accept time  behold  now is the day of salvat  6  3 give no offenc in ani thing  that the ministri be not blame  6  4 but in all thing approv ourselv as the minist of god  in much patienc  in afflict  in necess  in distress  6  5 in stripe  in imprison  in tumult  in labour  in watch  in fast  6  6 by pure  by knowledg  by longsuff  by kind  by the holi ghost  by love unfeign  6  7 by the word of truth  by the power of god  by the armour of righteous on the right hand and on the left  6  8 by honour and dishonour  by evil report and good report  as deceiv  and yet true  6  9 as unknown  and yet well known  as die  and  behold  we live  as chasten  and not kill  6  10 as sorrow  yet alway rejoic  as poor  yet make mani rich  as have noth  and yet possess all thing  6  11 o ye corinthian  our mouth is open unto you  our heart is enlarg  6  12 ye are not straiten in us  but ye are straiten in your own bowel  6  13 now for a recomp in the same   i speak as unto my children  be ye also enlarg  6  14 be ye not unequ yoke togeth with unbeliev  for what fellowship hath righteous with unright  and what communion hath light with dark  6  15 and what concord hath christ with belial  or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel  6  16 and what agreement hath the templ of god with idol  for ye are the templ of the live god  as god hath said  i will dwell in them  and walk in them  and i will be their god  and they shall be my peopl  6  17 wherefor come out from among them  and be ye separ  saith the lord  and touch not the unclean thing  and i will receiv you  6  18 and will be a father unto you  and ye shall be my son and daughter  saith the lord almighti  7  1 have therefor these promis  dear belov  let us cleans ourselv from all filthi of the flesh and spirit  perfect holi in the fear of god  7  2 receiv us  we have wrong no man  we have corrupt no man  we have defraud no man  7  3 i speak not this to condemn you  for i have said befor  that ye are in our heart to die and live with you  7  4 great is my bold of speech toward you  great is my glori of you  i am fill with comfort  i am exceed joy in all our tribul  7  5 for  when we were come into macedonia  our flesh had no rest  but we were troubl on everi side  without were fight  within were fear  7  6 nevertheless god  that comforteth those that are cast down  comfort us by the come of titus  7  7 and not by his come onli  but by the consol wherewith he was comfort in you  when he told us your earnest desir  your mourn  your fervent mind toward me  so that i rejoic the more  7  8 for though i made you sorri with a letter  i do not repent  though i did repent  for i perceiv that the same epistl hath made you sorri  though it were but for a season  7  9 now i rejoic  not that ye were made sorri  but that ye sorrow to repent  for ye were made sorri after a god manner  that ye might receiv damag by us in noth  7  10 for god sorrow worketh repent to salvat not to be repent of  but the sorrow of the world worketh death  7  11 for behold this selfsam thing  that ye sorrow after a god sort  what care it wrought in you  yea  what clear of yourselv  yea  what indign  yea  what fear  yea  what vehement desir  yea  what zeal  yea  what reveng  in all thing ye have approv yourselv to be clear in this matter  7  12 wherefor  though i wrote unto you  i did it not for his caus that had done the wrong  nor for his caus that suffer wrong  but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you  7  13 therefor we were comfort in your comfort  yea  and exceed the more joy we for the joy of titus  becaus his spirit was refresh by you all  7  14 for if i have boast ani thing to him of you  i am not asham  but as we spake all thing to you in truth  even so our boast  which i made befor titus  is found a truth  7  15 and his inward affect is more abund toward you  whilst he remembereth the obedi of you all  how with fear and trembl ye receiv him  7  16 i rejoic therefor that i have confid in you in all thing  8  1 moreov  brethren  we do you to wit of the grace of god bestow on the church of macedonia  8  2 how that in a great trial of afflict the abund of their joy and their deep poverti abound unto the rich of their liber  8  3 for to their power  i bear record  yea  and beyond their power they were will of themselv  8  4 pray us with much intreati that we would receiv the gift  and take upon us the fellowship of the minist to the saint  8  5 and this they did  not as we hope  but first gave their own selv to the lord  and unto us by the will of god  8  6 insomuch that we desir titus  that as he had begun  so he would also finish in you the same grace also  8  7 therefor  as ye abound in everi thing  in faith  and utter  and knowledg  and in all dilig  and in your love to us  see that ye abound in this grace also  8  8 i speak not by command  but by occas of the forward of other  and to prove the sincer of your love  8  9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ  that  though he was rich  yet for your sake he becam poor  that ye through his poverti might be rich  8  10 and herein i give my advic  for this is expedi for you  who have begun befor  not onli to do  but also to be forward a year ago  8  11 now therefor perform the do of it  that as there was a readi to will  so there may be a perform also out of that which ye have  8  12 for if there be first a will mind  it is accept accord to that a man hath  and not accord to that he hath not  8  13 for i mean not that other men be eas  and ye burden  8  14 but by an equal  that now at this time your abund may be a suppli for their want  that their abund also may be a suppli for your want  that there may be equal  8  15 as it is written  he that had gather much had noth over  and he that had gather littl had no lack  8  16 but thank be to god  which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you  8  17 for inde he accept the exhort  but be more forward  of his own accord he went unto you  8  18 and we have sent with him the brother  whose prais is in the gospel throughout all the church  8  19 and not that onli  but who was also chosen of the church to travel with us with this grace  which is administ by us to the glori of the same lord  and declar of your readi mind  8  20 avoid this  that no man should blame us in this abund which is administ by us  8  21 provid for honest thing  not onli in the sight of the lord  but also in the sight of men  8  22 and we have sent with them our brother  whom we have oftentim prove dilig in mani thing  but now much more dilig  upon the great confid which i have in you  8  23 whether ani do enquir of titus  he is my partner and fellowhelp concern you  or our brethren be enquir of  they are the messeng of the church  and the glori of christ  8  24 wherefor shew ye to them  and befor the church  the proof of your love  and of our boast on your behalf  9  1 for as touch the minist to the saint  it is superflu for me to write to you  9  2 for i know the forward of your mind  for which i boast of you to them of macedonia  that achaia was readi a year ago  and your zeal hath provok veri mani  9  3 yet have i sent the brethren  lest our boast of you should be in vain in this behalf  that  as i said  ye may be readi  9  4 lest hapli if they of macedonia come with me  and find you unprepar  we  that we say not  ye  should be asham in this same confid boast  9  5 therefor i thought it necessari to exhort the brethren  that they would go befor unto you  and make up beforehand your bounti  whereof ye had notic befor  that the same might be readi  as a matter of bounti  and not as of covet  9  6 but this i say  he which soweth spare shall reap also spare  and he which soweth bounti shall reap also bounti  9  7 everi man accord as he purposeth in his heart  so let him give  not grudg  or of necess  for god loveth a cheer giver  9  8 and god is abl to make all grace abound toward you  that ye  alway have all suffici in all thing  may abound to everi good work  9  9  as it is written  he hath dispers abroad  he hath given to the poor  his righteous remaineth for ever  9  10 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minist bread for your food  and multipli your seed sown  and increas the fruit of your righteous  9  11 be enrich in everi thing to all bounti  which causeth through us thanksgiv to god  9  12 for the administr of this servic not onli supplieth the want of the saint  but is abund also by mani thanksgiv unto god  9  13 while by the experi of this ministr they glorifi god for your profess subject unto the gospel of christ  and for your liber distribut unto them  and unto all men  9  14 and by their prayer for you  which long after you for the exceed grace of god in you  9  15 thank be unto god for his unspeak gift  10  1 now i paul myself beseech you by the meek and gentl of christ  who in presenc am base among you  but be absent am bold toward you  10  2 but i beseech you  that i may not be bold when i am present with that confid  wherewith i think to be bold against some  which think of us as if we walk accord to the flesh  10  3 for though we walk in the flesh  we do not war after the flesh  10  4  for the weapon of our warfar are not carnal  but mighti through god to the pull down of strong hold  10  5 cast down imagin  and everi high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledg of god  and bring into captiv everi thought to the obedi of christ  10  6 and have in a readi to reveng all disobedi  when your obedi is fulfil  10  7 do ye look on thing after the outward appear  if ani man trust to himself that he is christ  s  let him of himself think this again  that  as he is christ  s  even so are we christ  s  10  8 for though i should boast somewhat more of our author  which the lord hath given us for edif  and not for your destruct  i should not be asham  10  9 that i may not seem as if i would terrifi you by letter  10  10 for his letter  say they  are weighti and power  but his bodili presenc is weak  and his speech contempt  10  11 let such an one think this  that  such as we are in word by letter when we are absent  such will we be also in deed when we are present  10  12 for we dare not make ourselv of the number  or compar ourselv with some that commend themselv  but they measur themselv by themselv  and compar themselv among themselv  are not wise  10  13 but we will not boast of thing without our measur  but accord to the measur of the rule which god hath distribut to us  a measur to reach even unto you  10  14 for we stretch not ourselv beyond our measur  as though we reach not unto you  for we are come as far as to you also in preach the gospel of christ  10  15 not boast of thing without our measur  that is  of other men  s labour  but have hope  when your faith is increas  that we shall be enlarg by you accord to our rule abund  10  16 to preach the gospel in the region beyond you  and not to boast in anoth man  s line of thing made readi to our hand  10  17 but he that glorieth  let him glori in the lord  10  18 for not he that commendeth himself is approv  but whom the lord commendeth  11  1 would to god ye could bear with me a littl in my folli  and inde bear with me  11  2 for i am jealous over you with god jealousi  for i have espous you to one husband  that i may present you as a chast virgin to christ  11  3 but i fear  lest by ani mean  as the serpent beguil eve through his subtilti  so your mind should be corrupt from the simplic that is in christ  11  4 for if he that cometh preacheth anoth jesus  whom we have not preach  or if ye receiv anoth spirit  which ye have not receiv  or anoth gospel  which ye have not accept  ye might well bear with him  11  5 for i suppos i was not a whit behind the veri chiefest apostl  11  6 but though i be rude in speech  yet not in knowledg  but we have been through made manifest among you in all thing  11  7 have i commit an offenc in abas myself that ye might be exalt  becaus i have preach to you the gospel of god freeli  11  8 i rob other church  take wage of them  to do you servic  11  9 and when i was present with you  and want  i was chargeabl to no man  for that which was lack to me the brethren which came from macedonia suppli  and in all thing i have kept myself from be burdensom unto you  and so will i keep myself  11  10 as the truth of christ is in me  no man shall stop me of this boast in the region of achaia  11  11 wherefor  becaus i love you not  god knoweth  11  12 but what i do  that i will do  that i may cut off occas from them which desir occas  that wherein they glori  they may be found even as we  11  13 for such are fals apostl  deceit worker  transform themselv into the apostl of christ  11  14 and no marvel  for satan himself is transform into an angel of light  11  15 therefor it is no great thing if his minist also be transform as the minist of righteous  whose end shall be accord to their work  11  16 i say again  let no man think me a fool  if otherwis  yet as a fool receiv me  that i may boast myself a littl  11  17 that which i speak  i speak it not after the lord  but as it were foolish  in this confid of boast  11  18 see that mani glori after the flesh  i will glori also  11  19 for ye suffer fool glad  see ye yourselv are wise  11  20 for ye suffer  if a man bring you into bondag  if a man devour you  if a man take of you  if a man exalt himself  if a man smite you on the face  11  21 i speak as concern reproach  as though we had been weak  howbeit whereinsoev ani is bold   i speak foolish  i am bold also  11  22 are they hebrew  so am i  are they israelit  so am i  are they the seed of abraham  so am i  11  23 are they minist of christ   i speak as a fool  i am more  in labour more abund  in stripe abov measur  in prison more frequent  in death oft  11  24 of the jew five time receiv i forti stripe save one  11  25 thrice was i beaten with rod  onc was i stone  thrice i suffer shipwreck  a night and a day i have been in the deep  11  26 in journey often  in peril of water  in peril of robber  in peril by mine own countrymen  in peril by the heathen  in peril in the citi  in peril in the wilder  in peril in the sea  in peril among fals brethren  11  27 in weari and pain  in watch often  in hunger and thirst  in fast often  in cold and naked  11  28 besid those thing that are without  that which cometh upon me daili  the care of all the church  11  29 who is weak  and i am not weak  who is offend  and i burn not  11  30 if i must need glori  i will glori of the thing which concern mine infirm  11  31 the god and father of our lord jesus christ  which is bless for evermor  knoweth that i lie not  11  32 in damascus the governor under areta the king kept the citi of the damascen with a garrison  desir to apprehend me  11  33 and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall  and escap his hand  12  1 it is not expedi for me doubtless to glori  i will come to vision and revel of the lord  12  2 i knew a man in christ abov fourteen year ago   whether in the bodi  i cannot tell  or whether out of the bodi  i cannot tell  god knoweth  such an one caught up to the third heaven  12  3 and i knew such a man   whether in the bodi  or out of the bodi  i cannot tell  god knoweth  12  4 how that he was caught up into paradis  and heard unspeak word  which it is not law for a man to utter  12  5 of such an one will i glori  yet of myself i will not glori  but in mine infirm  12  6 for though i would desir to glori  i shall not be a fool  for i will say the truth  but now i forbear  lest ani man should think of me abov that which he seeth me to be  or that he heareth of me  12  7 and lest i should be exalt abov measur through the abund of the revel  there was given to me a thorn in the flesh  the messeng of satan to buffet me  lest i should be exalt abov measur  12  8 for this thing i besought the lord thrice  that it might depart from me  12  9 and he said unto me  my grace is suffici for thee  for my strength is made perfect in weak  most glad therefor will i rather glori in my infirm  that the power of christ may rest upon me  12  10 therefor i take pleasur in infirm  in reproach  in necess  in persecut  in distress for christ  s sake  for when i am weak  then am i strong  12  11 i am becom a fool in glori  ye have compel me  for i ought to have been commend of you  for in noth am i behind the veri chiefest apostl  though i be noth  12  12 truli the sign of an apostl were wrought among you in all patienc  in sign  and wonder  and mighti deed  12  13 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other church  except it be that i myself was not burdensom to you  forgiv me this wrong  12  14 behold  the third time i am readi to come to you  and i will not be burdensom to you  for i seek not your  s but you  for the children ought not to lay up for the parent  but the parent for the children  12  15 and i will veri glad spend and be spent for you  though the more abund i love you  the less i be love  12  16 but be it so  i did not burden you  nevertheless  be crafti  i caught you with guil  12  17 did i make a gain of you by ani of them whom i sent unto you  12  18 i desir titus  and with him i sent a brother  did titus make a gain of you  walk we not in the same spirit  walk we not in the same step  12  19 again  think ye that we excus ourselv unto you  we speak befor god in christ  but we do all thing  dear belov  for your edifi  12  20 for i fear  lest  when i come  i shall not find you such as i would  and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not  lest there be debat  envi  wrath  strife  backbit  whisper  swell  tumult  12  21 and lest  when i come again  my god will humbl me among you  and that i shall bewail mani which have sin alreadi  and have not repent of the unclean and fornic and lascivi which they have commit  13  1 this is the third time i am come to you  in the mouth of two or three wit shall everi word be establish  13  2 i told you befor  and foretel you  as if i were present  the second time  and be absent now i write to them which heretofor have sin  and to all other  that  if i come again  i will not spare  13  3 sinc ye seek a proof of christ speak in me  which to you  ward is not weak  but is mighti in you  13  4 for though he was crucifi through weak  yet he liveth by the power of god  for we also are weak in him  but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you  13  5 examin yourselv  whether ye be in the faith  prove your own selv  know ye not your own selv  how that jesus christ is in you  except ye be reprob  13  6 but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprob  13  7 now i pray to god that ye do no evil  not that we should appear approv  but that ye should do that which is honest  though we be as reprob  13  8 for we can do noth against the truth  but for the truth  13  9 for we are glad  when we are weak  and ye are strong  and this also we wish  even your perfect  13  10 therefor i write these thing be absent  lest be present i should use sharp  accord to the power which the lord hath given me to edif  and not to destruct  13  11 final  brethren  farewel  be perfect  be of good comfort  be of one mind  live in peac  and the god of love and peac shall be with you  13  12 greet one anoth with an holi kiss  13  13 all the saint salut you  13  14 the grace of the lord jesus christ  and the love of god  and the communion of the holi ghost  be with you all  amen  the epistl of paul the apostl to the galatian 1  1 paul  an apostl   not of men  neither by man  but by jesus christ  and god the father  who rais him from the dead  1  2 and all the brethren which are with me  unto the church of galatia  1  3 grace be to you and peac from god the father  and from our lord jesus christ  1  4 who gave himself for our sin  that he might deliv us from this present evil world  accord to the will of god and our father  1  5 to whom be glori for ever and ever  amen  1  6 i marvel that ye are so soon remov from him that call you into the grace of christ unto anoth gospel  1  7 which is not anoth  but there be some that troubl you  and would pervert the gospel of christ  1  8 but though we  or an angel from heaven  preach ani other gospel unto you than that which we have preach unto you  let him be accurs  1  9 as we said befor  so say i now again  if ani man preach ani other gospel unto you than that ye have receiv  let him be accurs  1  10 for do i now persuad men  or god  or do i seek to pleas men  for if i yet pleas men  i should not be the servant of christ  1  11 but i certifi you  brethren  that the gospel which was preach of me is not after man  1  12 for i neither receiv it of man  neither was i taught it  but by the revel of jesus christ  1  13 for ye have heard of my convers in time past in the jew  religion  how that beyond measur i persecut the church of god  and wast it  1  14 and profit in the jew  religion abov mani my equal in mine own nation  be more exceed zealous of the tradit of my father  1  15 but when it pleas god  who separ me from my mother  s womb  and call me by his grace  1  16 to reveal his son in me  that i might preach him among the heathen  immedi i confer not with flesh and blood  1  17 neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostl befor me  but i went into arabia  and return again unto damascus  1  18 then after three year i went up to jerusalem to see peter  and abod with him fifteen day  1  19 but other of the apostl saw i none  save jame the lord  s brother  1  20 now the thing which i write unto you  behold  befor god  i lie not  1  21 afterward i came into the region of syria and cilicia  1  22 and was unknown by face unto the church of judaea which were in christ  1  23 but they had heard onli  that he which persecut us in time past now preacheth the faith which onc he destroy  1  24 and they glorifi god in me  2  1 then fourteen year after i went up again to jerusalem with barnaba  and took titus with me also  2  2 and i went up by revel  and communic unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentil  but privat to them which were of reput  lest by ani mean i should run  or had run  in vain  2  3 but neither titus  who was with me  be a greek  was compel to be circumcis  2  4 and that becaus of fals brethren unawar brought in  who came in privili to spi out our liberti which we have in christ jesus  that they might bring us into bondag  2  5 to whom we gave place by subject  no  not for an hour  that the truth of the gospel might continu with you  2  6 but of these who seem to be somewhat   whatsoev they were  it maketh no matter to me  god accepteth no man  s person  for they who seem to be somewhat in confer ad noth to me  2  7 but contrariwis  when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcis was commit unto me  as the gospel of the circumcis was unto peter  2  8  for he that wrought effectu in peter to the apostleship of the circumcis  the same was mighti in me toward the gentil  2  9 and when jame  cepha  and john  who seem to be pillar  perceiv the grace that was given unto me  they gave to me and barnaba the right hand of fellowship  that we should go unto the heathen  and they unto the circumcis  2  10 onli they would that we should rememb the poor  the same which i also was forward to do  2  11 but when peter was come to antioch  i withstood him to the face  becaus he was to be blame  2  12 for befor that certain came from jame  he did eat with the gentil  but when they were come  he withdrew and separ himself  fear them which were of the circumcis  2  13 and the other jew dissembl likewis with him  insomuch that barnaba also was carri away with their dissimul  2  14 but when i saw that they walk not upright accord to the truth of the gospel  i said unto peter befor them all  if thou  be a jew  livest after the manner of gentil  and not as do the jew  whi compellest thou the gentil to live as do the jew  2  15 we who are jew by natur  and not sinner of the gentil  2  16 know that a man is not justifi by the work of the law  but by the faith of jesus christ  even we have believ in jesus christ  that we might be justifi by the faith of christ  and not by the work of the law  for by the work of the law shall no flesh be justifi  2  17 but if  while we seek to be justifi by christ  we ourselv also are found sinner  is therefor christ the minist of sin  god forbid  2  18 for if i build again the thing which i destroy  i make myself a transgressor  2  19 for i through the law am dead to the law  that i might live unto god  2  20 i am crucifi with christ  neverthless i live  yet not i  but christ liveth in me  and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god  who love me  and gave himself for me  2  21 i do not frustrat the grace of god  for if righteous come by the law  then christ is dead in vain  3  1 o foolish galatian  who hath bewitch you  that ye should not obey the truth  befor whose eye jesus christ hath been evid set forth  crucifi among you  3  2 this onli would i learn of you  receiv ye the spirit by the work of the law  or by the hear of faith  3  3 are ye so foolish  have begun in the spirit  are ye now made perfect by the flesh  3  4 have ye suffer so mani thing in vain  if it be yet in vain  3  5 he therefor that ministereth to you the spirit  and worketh miracl among you  doeth he it by the work of the law  or by the hear of faith  3  6 even as abraham believ god  and it was account to him for righteous  3  7 know ye therefor that they which are of faith  the same are the children of abraham  3  8 and the scriptur  forese that god would justifi the heathen through faith  preach befor the gospel unto abraham  say  in thee shall all nation be bless  3  9 so then they which be of faith are bless with faith abraham  3  10 for as mani as are of the work of the law are under the curs  for it is written  curs is everi one that continueth not in all thing which are written in the book of the law to do them  3  11 but that no man is justifi by the law in the sight of god  it is evid  for  the just shall live by faith  3  12 and the law is not of faith  but  the man that doeth them shall live in them  3  13 christ hath redeem us from the curs of the law  be made a curs for us  for it is written  curs is everi one that hangeth on a tree  3  14 that the bless of abraham might come on the gentil through jesus christ  that we might receiv the promis of the spirit through faith  3  15 brethren  i speak after the manner of men  though it be but a man  s coven  yet if it be confirm  no man disannulleth  or addeth thereto  3  16 now to abraham and his seed were the promis made  he saith not  and to seed  as of mani  but as of one  and to thi seed  which is christ  3  17 and this i say  that the coven  that was confirm befor of god in christ  the law  which was four hundr and thirti year after  cannot disannul  that it should make the promis of none effect  3  18 for if the inherit be of the law  it is no more of promis  but god gave it to abraham by promis  3  19 wherefor then serveth the law  it was ad becaus of transgress  till the seed should come to whom the promis was made  and it was ordain by angel in the hand of a mediat  3  20 now a mediat is not a mediat of one  but god is one  3  21 is the law then against the promis of god  god forbid  for if there had been a law given which could have given life  verili righteous should have been by the law  3  22 but the scriptur hath conclud all under sin  that the promis by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believ  3  23 but befor faith came  we were kept under the law  shut up unto the faith which should afterward be reveal  3  24 wherefor the law was our schoolmast to bring us unto christ  that we might be justifi by faith  3  25 but after that faith is come  we are no longer under a schoolmast  3  26 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus  3  27 for as mani of you as have been baptiz into christ have put on christ  3  28 there is neither jew nor greek  there is neither bond nor free  there is neither male nor femal  for ye are all one in christ jesus  3  29 and if ye be christ  s  then are ye abraham  s seed  and heir accord to the promis  4  1 now i say  that the heir  as long as he is a child  differeth noth from a servant  though he be lord of all  4  2 but is under tutor and governor until the time appoint of the father  4  3 even so we  when we were children  were in bondag under the element of the world  4  4 but when the ful of the time was come  god sent forth his son  made of a woman  made under the law  4  5 to redeem them that were under the law  that we might receiv the adopt of son  4  6 and becaus ye are son  god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart  cri  abba  father  4  7 wherefor thou art no more a servant  but a son  and if a son  then an heir of god through christ  4  8 howbeit then  when ye knew not god  ye did servic unto them which by natur are no god  4  9 but now  after that ye have known god  or rather are known of god  how turn ye again to the weak and beggar element  whereunto ye desir again to be in bondag  4  10 ye observ day  and month  and time  and year  4  11 i am afraid of you  lest i have bestow upon you labour in vain  4  12 brethren  i beseech you  be as i am  for i am as ye are  ye have not injur me at all  4  13 ye know how through infirm of the flesh i preach the gospel unto you at the first  4  14 and my temptat which was in my flesh ye despis not  nor reject  but receiv me as an angel of god  even as christ jesus  4  15 where is then the blessed ye spake of  for i bear you record  that  if it had been possibl  ye would have pluck out your own eye  and have given them to me  4  16 am i therefor becom your enemi  becaus i tell you the truth  4  17 they zealous affect you  but not well  yea  they would exclud you  that ye might affect them  4  18 but it is good to be zealous affect alway in a good thing  and not onli when i am present with you  4  19 my littl children  of whom i travail in birth again until christ be form in you  4  20 i desir to be present with you now  and to chang my voic  for i stand in doubt of you  4  21 tell me  ye that desir to be under the law  do ye not hear the law  4  22 for it is written  that abraham had two son  the one by a bondmaid  the other by a freewoman  4  23 but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh  but he of the freewoman was by promis  4  24 which thing are an allegori  for these are the two coven  the one from the mount sinai  which gendereth to bondag  which is agar  4  25 for this agar is mount sinai in arabia  and answereth to jerusalem which now is  and is in bondag with her children  4  26 but jerusalem which is abov is free  which is the mother of us all  4  27 for it is written  rejoic  thou barren that bearest not  break forth and cri  thou that travailest not  for the desol hath mani more children than she which hath an husband  4  28 now we  brethren  as isaac was  are the children of promis  4  29 but as then he that was born after the flesh persecut him that was born after the spirit  even so it is now  4  30 nevertheless what saith the scriptur  cast out the bondwoman and her son  for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman  4  31 so then  brethren  we are not children of the bondwoman  but of the free  5  1 stand fast therefor in the liberti wherewith christ hath made us free  and be not entangl again with the yoke of bondag  5  2 behold  i paul say unto you  that if ye be circumcis  christ shall profit you noth  5  3 for i testifi again to everi man that is circumcis  that he is a debtor to do the whole law  5  4 christ is becom of no effect unto you  whosoev of you are justifi by the law  ye are fallen from grace  5  5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteous by faith  5  6 for in jesus christ neither circumcis availeth ani thing  nor uncircumcis  but faith which worketh by love  5  7 ye did run well  who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth  5  8 this persuas cometh not of him that calleth you  5  9 a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump  5  10 i have confid in you through the lord  that ye will be none otherwis mind  but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment  whosoev he be  5  11 and i  brethren  if i yet preach circumcis  whi do i yet suffer persecut  then is the offenc of the cross ceas  5  12 i would they were even cut off which troubl you  5  13 for  brethren  ye have been call unto liberti  onli use not liberti for an occas to the flesh  but by love serv one anoth  5  14 for all the law is fulfil in one word  even in this  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  5  15 but if ye bite and devour one anoth  take heed that ye be not consum one of anoth  5  16 this i say then  walk in the spirit  and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh  5  17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit  and the spirit against the flesh  and these are contrari the one to the other  so that ye cannot do the thing that ye would  5  18 but if ye be led of the spirit  ye are not under the law  5  19 now the work of the flesh are manifest  which are these  adulteri  fornic  unclean  lascivi  5  20 idolatri  witchcraft  hatr  varianc  emul  wrath  strife  sedit  heresi  5  21 envi  murder  drunken  revel  and such like  of the which i tell you befor  as i have also told you in time past  that they which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of god  5  22 but the fruit of the spirit is love  joy  peac  longsuff  gentl  good  faith  5  23 meek  temper  against such there is no law  5  24 and they that are christ  s have crucifi the flesh with the affect and lust  5  25 if we live in the spirit  let us also walk in the spirit  5  26 let us not be desir of vain glori  provok one anoth  envi one anoth  6  1 brethren  if a man be overtaken in a fault  ye which are spiritu  restor such an one in the spirit of meek  consid thyself  lest thou also be tempt  6  2 bear ye one anoth  s burden  and so fulfil the law of christ  6  3 for if a man think himself to be someth  when he is noth  he deceiveth himself  6  4 but let everi man prove his own work  and then shall he have rejoic in himself alon  and not in anoth  6  5 for everi man shall bear his own burden  6  6 let him that is taught in the word communic unto him that teacheth in all good thing  6  7 be not deceiv  god is not mock  for whatsoev a man soweth  that shall he also reap  6  8 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corrupt  but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlast  6  9 and let us not be weari in well do  for in due season we shall reap  if we faint not  6  10 as we have therefor opportun  let us do good unto all men  especi unto them who are of the household of faith  6  11 ye see how larg a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand  6  12 as mani as desir to make a fair shew in the flesh  they constrain you to be circumcis  onli lest they should suffer persecut for the cross of christ  6  13 for neither they themselv who are circumcis keep the law  but desir to have you circumcis  that they may glori in your flesh  6  14 but god forbid that i should glori  save in the cross of our lord jesus christ  by whom the world is crucifi unto me  and i unto the world  6  15 for in christ jesus neither circumcis availeth ani thing  nor uncircumcis  but a new creatur  6  16 and as mani as walk accord to this rule  peac be on them  and merci  and upon the israel of god  6  17 from henceforth let no man troubl me  for i bear in my bodi the mark of the lord jesus  6  18 brethren  the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit  amen  the epistl of paul the apostl

 5  22 wive  submit yourselv unto your own husband  as unto the lord  5  23 for the husband is the head of the wife  even as christ is the head of the church  and he is the saviour of the bodi  5  24 therefor as the church is subject unto christ  so let the wive be to their own husband in everi thing  5  25 husband  love your wive  even as christ also love the church  and gave himself for it  5  26 that he might sanctifi and cleans it with the wash of water by the word  5  27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church  not have spot  or wrinkl  or ani such thing  but that it should be holi and without blemish  5  28 so ought men to love their wive as their own bodi  he that loveth his wife loveth himself  5  29 for no man ever yet hate his own flesh  but nourisheth and cherisheth it  even as the lord the church  5  30 for we are member of his bodi  of his flesh  and of his bone  5  31 for this caus shall a man leav his father and mother  and shall be join unto his

should understand  brethren  that the thing which happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the further of the gospel  1  13 so that my bond in christ are manifest in all the palac  and in all other place  1  14 and mani of the brethren in the lord  wax confid by my bond  are much more bold to speak the word without fear  1  15 some inde preach christ even of envi and strife  and some also of good will  1  16 the one preach christ of content  not sincer  suppos to add afflict to my bond  1  17 but the other of love  know that i am set for the defenc of the gospel  1  18 what then  notwithstand  everi way  whether in pretenc  or in truth  christ is preach  and i therein do rejoic  yea  and will rejoic  1  19 for i know that this shall turn to my salvat through your prayer  and

but in lowli of mind let each esteem other better than themselv  2  4 look not everi man on his own thing  but everi man also on the thing of other  2  5 let this mind be in you  which was also in

christ by the command of god our saviour  and lord jesus christ  which is our hope  1  2 unto timothi  my own son in the faith  grace  merci  and peac  from god our father and jesus christ our lord  1  3 as i besought thee to abid still at ephesus  when i went into macedonia  that thou mightest charg some that they teach no other doctrin  1  4 neither give heed to fabl and endless genealog  which minist question  rather than god edifi which is in faith  so do  1  5 now the end of the command is chariti out of a pure heart  and of a good conscienc  and of faith unfeign  1  6 from which some have swerv have turn asid unto vain jangl  1  7 desir to be teacher of the law  understand neither what they say  nor whereof they affirm  1  8 but we know that the law is good  if a man use it law  1  9 know this  that the law is not made for a righteous man  but for the lawless and disobedi  for the ungod and for sinner  for unholi and profan  for murder of father and murder of mother  for manslay  1  10 for whoremong  for them that defil themselv with mankind  for mensteal  for liar  for perjur person  and if there be ani other thing that is contrari to sound doctrin  1  11 accord to the glorious gospel of the bless god  which was commit to my trust  1  12 and i thank christ jesus our lord  who hath enabl me  for that he count me faith  put me into the ministri  1  13 who was befor a blasphem  and a persecutor  and injuri  but i obtain merci  becaus i did it ignor in unbelief  1  14 and the grace of our lord was exceed abund with faith and love which is in christ jesus  1  15 this is a faith say  and worthi of all accept  that christ jesus came into the world to save sinner  of whom i am chief  1  16 howbeit for this caus i obtain merci  that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuff  for a pattern to them which should hereaft believ on him to life everlast  1  17 now unto the king etern  immort  invis  the onli wise god  be honour and glori for ever

which some have put away concern faith have made shipwreck  1  20 of whom is hymenaeus and alexand  whom i have deliv unto satan  that they may learn not to blasphem  2  1 i exhort therefor  that  first of all  supplic  prayer  intercess  and give of thank  be made for all men  2  2 for king  and for all that are in author  that we may lead a quiet and peaceabl life in all godli and honesti  2  3 for this is good and accept in the sight of god our saviour  2  4 who will have all men to be save  and to come unto the knowledg of the truth  2  5 for there is one god  and one mediat between god and men  the man christ jesus  2  6 who gave himself a ransom for all  to be testifi in due time  2  7 whereunto i am ordain a preacher  and an apostl   i speak the truth in christ  and lie not  a teacher of the gentil in faith and veriti  2  8 i will therefor that men pray everi where  lift up holi hand  without wrath and doubt  2  9 in like manner also  that women adorn themselv in modest apparel  with shamefaced and sobrieti  not with broid hair  or gold  or pearl  or cost array  2  10 but  which becometh women profess godli  with good work  2  11 let the woman learn in silenc with all subject  2  12 but i suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp author over the man  but to be in silenc  2  13 for adam was first form  then eve  2  14 and adam was not deceiv  but the woman be deceiv was in the transgress  2  15 notwithstand she shall be save in childbear  if they continu in faith and chariti and holi with sobrieti  3  1 this is a true say  if a man desir the offic of a bishop  he desireth a good work  3  2 a bishop then must be blameless  the husband of one wife  vigil  sober  of good behaviour  given to hospit  apt to teach  3  3 not given to wine  no striker  not greedi of filthi lucr  but patient  not a brawler  not covet  3  4 one that ruleth well his own hous  have his children in subject with all graviti  3  5  for if a man know not how to rule his own hous  how shall he take care of the church of god  3  6 not a novic  lest be lift up with pride he fall into the condemn of the devil  3  7 moreov he must have a good report of them which are without  lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil  3  8 likewis must the deacon be grave  not doubletongu  not given to much wine  not greedi of filthi lucr  3  9 hold the mysteri of the faith in a pure conscienc  3  10 and let these also first be prove  then let them use the offic of a deacon  be found blameless  3  11 even so must their wive be grave  not slander  sober  faith in all thing  3  12 let the deacon be the husband of one wife  rule their children and their own hous well  3  13 for they that have use the offic of a deacon well purchas to themselv a good degre  and great bold in the faith which is in christ jesus  3  14 these thing write i unto thee  hope to come unto thee short  3  15 but if i tarri long  that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behav thyself in the hous of god  which is the church of the live god  the pillar and ground of the truth  3  16 and without controversi great is the mysteri of godli  god was manifest in the flesh  justifi in the spirit  seen of angel  preach unto the gentil  believ on in the world  receiv up into glori  4  1 now the spirit speaketh expressli  that in the latter time some shall depart from the faith  give heed to seduc spirit  and doctrin of devil  4  2 speak lie in hypocrisi  have their conscienc sear with a hot iron  4  3 forbid to marri  and command to abstain from meat  which god hath creat to be receiv with thanksgiv of them which believ and know the truth  4  4 for everi creatur of god is good  and noth to be refus  if it be receiv with thanksgiv  4  5 for it is sanctifi by the word of god and prayer  4  6 if thou put the brethren in remembr of these thing  thou shalt be a good minist of jesus christ  nourish up in the word of faith and of good doctrin  whereunto thou hast attain  4  7 but refus profan and old wive  fabl  and exercis thyself rather unto godli  4  8 for bodili exercis profiteth littl  but godli is profit unto all thing  have promis of the life that now is  and of that which is to come  4  9 this is a faith say and worthi of all accept  4  10 for therefor we both labour and suffer reproach  becaus we trust in the live god  who is the saviour of all men  special of those that believ  4  11 these thing command and teach  4  12 let no man despis thi youth  but be thou an exampl of the believ  in word  in convers  in chariti  in spirit  in faith  in puriti  4  13 till i come  give attend to read  to exhort  to doctrin  4  14 neglect not the gift that is in thee  which was given thee by propheci  with the lay on of the hand of the presbyteri  4  15 medit upon these thing  give thyself wholli to them  that thi profit may appear to all  4  16 take heed unto thyself  and unto the doctrin  continu in them  for in do this thou shalt both save thyself  and them that hear thee  5  1 rebuk not an elder  but intreat him as a father  and the younger men as brethren  5  2 the elder women as mother  the younger as sister  with all puriti  5  3 honour widow that are widow inde  5  4 but if ani widow have children or nephew  let them learn first to shew pieti at home  and to requit their parent  for that is good and accept befor god  5  5 now she that is a widow inde  and desol  trusteth in god  and continueth in supplic and prayer night and day  5  6 but she that liveth in pleasur is dead while she liveth  5  7 and these thing give in charg  that they may be blameless  5  8 but if ani provid not for his own  and special for those of his own hous  he hath deni the faith  and is wors than an infidel  5  9 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescor year old  have been the wife of one man  5  10 well report of for good work  if she have brought up children  if she have lodg stranger  if she have wash the saint  feet  if she have reliev the afflict  if she have dilig follow everi good work  5  11 but the younger widow refus  for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ  they will marri  5  12 have damnat  becaus they have cast off their first faith  5  13 and withal they learn to be idl  wander about from hous to hous  and not onli idl  but tattler also and busybodi  speak thing which they ought not  5  14 i will therefor that the younger women marri  bear children  guid the hous  give none occas to the adversari to speak reproach  5  15 for some are alreadi turn asid after satan  5  16 if ani man or woman that believeth have widow  let them reliev them  and let not the church be charg  that it may reliev them that are widow inde  5  17 let the elder that rule well be count worthi of doubl honour  especi they who labour in the word and doctrin  5  18 for the scriptur saith  thou shalt not muzzl the ox that treadeth out the corn  and  the labour is worthi of his reward  5  19 against an elder receiv not an accus  but befor two or three wit  5  20 them that sin rebuk befor all  that other also may fear  5  21 i charg thee befor god  and the lord jesus christ  and the elect angel  that thou

manifest beforehand  and they that are otherwis cannot be hid  6  1 let as mani servant as are under the yoke count their own master worthi of all honour  that the name of god and his doctrin be not blasphem  6  2 and they that have believ master  let them not despis them  becaus they are brethren  but rather do them servic  becaus they are faith and belov  partak of the benefit  these thing teach and exhort  6  3 if ani man teach otherwis  and consent not to wholesom word  even the word of our lord jesus christ  and to the doctrin which is accord to godli  6  4 he is proud  know noth  but dote about question and strife of word  whereof cometh envi  strife  rail  evil surmis  6  5 pervers disput of men of corrupt mind  and destitut of the truth  suppos that gain is godli  from such

content  6  9 but they that will be rich fall into temptat and a snare  and into mani foolish and hurt lust  which drown men in destruct and perdit  6  10 for the love of money is the root of all evil  which while some covet after  they have er from the faith  and pierc themselv through with mani sorrow  6  11 but thou  o man of god  flee these thing  and follow after righteous  godli  faith  love

thee that which is conveni  1  9 yet for love  s sake i rather beseech thee  be such an one as paul the age  and now also a prison of jesus christ  1  10 i beseech thee for my son onesimus  whom i have begotten in my bond  1  11 which in time past was to thee unprofit  but now profit to thee and to me  1  12 whom i have sent again  thou therefor receiv him  that is  mine own bowel  1  13 whom i would have retain with me  that in thi stead he might have minist unto me in the bond of the gospel  1  14 but without thi mind would i do noth  that thi benefit should not be as it were of necess  but will  1  15 for perhap he therefor depart for a season  that thou shouldest receiv him for ever  1  16 not now as a servant  but abov a servant  a brother belov  special to me  but how much more

be given unto you  1  23 there salut thee epaphra  my fellowprison in christ jesus  1  24 marcus  aristarchus  dema  luca  my fellowlabour  1  25 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit  amen  the epistl of paul the apostl to the hebrew 1  1 god  who at sundri time and in diver manner spake in time past unto the father by the prophet  1  2 hath in these last day spoken unto us by his son  whom he hath appoint heir of all thing  by whom also he made the world  1  3 who be the bright of his glori  and the express imag of his person  and uphold all thing by the word of his power  when he had by himself purg our sin  sat down on the right hand of the majesti on high  1  4 be made so much better than the angel  as he hath by inherit obtain a more excel name than they  1  5 for unto which of the angel said he at ani time  thou art my son  this day have i begotten thee  and again  i will be to him a father  and he shall be to me a son  1  6 and again  when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world  he saith  and let all the angel of god worship him  1  7 and of the angel he saith  who maketh his angel spirit  and his minist a flame of fire  1  8 but unto the son he saith  thi throne  o god  is for ever and ever  a sceptr of righteous is the sceptr of thi kingdom  1  9 thou hast love righteous  and hate iniqu  therefor god  even thi god  hath anoint thee with the oil of glad abov thi fellow  1  10 and  thou  lord  in the begin hast laid the foundat of the earth  and the heaven are the work of thine hand  1  11 they shall perish  but thou remainest  and they all shall wax old as doth a garment  1  12 and as a vestur shalt thou fold them up  and they shall be chang  but thou art the same  and thi year shall not fail  1  13 but to which of the angel said he at ani time  sit on my right hand  until i make thine enemi thi footstool  1  14 are they not all minist spirit  sent forth to minist for them who shall be heir of salvat  2  1 therefor we ought to give the more earnest heed to the thing which we have heard  lest at ani time we should let them slip  2  2 for if the word spoken by angel was stedfast  and everi transgress and disobedi receiv a just recomp of reward  2  3 how shall we escap  if we neglect so great salvat  which at the first began to be spoken by the lord  and was confirm unto us by them that heard him  2  4 god also bear them wit  both with sign and wonder  and with diver miracl  and gift of the holi ghost  accord to his own will  2  5 for unto the angel hath he not put in subject the world to come  whereof we speak  2  6 but one in a certain place testifi  say  what is man  that thou art mind of him  or the son of man that thou visitest him  2  7 thou madest him a littl lower than the angel  thou crownedst him with glori and honour  and didst set him over the work of thi hand  2  8 thou hast put all thing in subject under his feet  for in that he put all in subject under him  he left noth that is not put under him  but now we see not yet all thing put under him  2  9 but we see jesus  who was made a littl lower than the angel for the suffer of death  crown with glori and honour  that he by the grace of god should tast death for everi man  2  10 for it becam him  for whom are all thing  and by whom are all thing  in bring mani son unto glori  to make the captain of their salvat perfect through suffer  2  11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctifi are all of one  for which caus he is not asham to call them brethren  2  12 say  i will declar thi name unto my brethren  in the midst of the church will i sing prais unto thee  2  13 and again  i will put my trust in him  and again  behold i and the children which god hath given me  2  14 forasmuch then as the children are partak of flesh and blood  he also himself likewis took part of the same  that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death  that is  the devil  2  15 and deliv them who through fear of death were all their lifetim subject to bondag  2  16 for verili he took not on him the natur of angel  but he took on him the seed of abraham  2  17 wherefor in all thing it behov him to be made like unto his brethren  that he might be a merci and faith high priest in thing pertain to god  to make reconcili for the sin of the peopl  2  18 for in that he himself hath suffer be tempt  he is abl to succour them that are tempt  3  1 wherefor  holi brethren  partak of the heaven call  consid the apostl and high priest of our profess  christ jesus  3  2 who was faith to him that appoint him  as also mose was faith in all his hous  3  3 for this man was count worthi of more glori than mose  inasmuch as he who hath build the hous hath more honour than the hous  3  4 for everi hous is build by some man  but he that built all thing is god  3  5 and mose verili was faith in all his hous  as a servant  for a testimoni of those thing which were to be spoken after  3  6 but christ as a son over his own hous  whose hous are we  if we hold fast the confid and the rejoic of the hope firm unto the end  3  7 wherefor  as the holi ghost saith  to day if ye will hear his voic  3  8 harden not your heart  as in the provoc  in the day of temptat in the wilder  3  9 when your father tempt me  prove me  and saw my work forti year  3  10 wherefor i was griev with that generat  and said  they do alway err in their heart  and they have not known my way  3  11 so i sware in my wrath  they shall not enter into my rest  3  12 take heed  brethren  lest there be in ani of you an evil heart of unbelief  in depart from the live god  3  13 but exhort one anoth daili  while it is call to day  lest ani of you be harden through the deceit of sin  3  14 for we are made partak of christ  if we hold the begin of our confid stedfast unto the end  3  15 while it is said  to day if ye will hear his voic  harden not your heart  as in the provoc  3  16 for some  when they had heard  did provok  howbeit not all that came out of egypt by mose  3  17 but with whom was he griev forti year  was it not with them that had sin  whose carcas fell in the wilder  3  18 and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest  but to them that believ not  3  19 so we see that they could not enter in becaus of unbelief  4  1 let us therefor fear  lest  a promis be left us of enter into his rest  ani of you should seem to come short of it  4  2 for unto us was the gospel preach  as well as unto them  but the word preach did not profit them  not be mix with faith in them that heard it  4  3 for we which have believ do enter into rest  as he said  as i have sworn in my wrath  if they shall enter into my rest  although the work were finish from the foundat of the world  4  4 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise  and god did rest the seventh day from all his work  4  5 and in this place again  if they shall enter into my rest  4  6 see therefor it remaineth that some must enter therein  and they to whom it was first preach enter not in becaus of unbelief  4  7 again  he limiteth a certain day  say in david  to day  after so long a time  as it is said  to day if ye will hear his voic  harden not your heart  4  8 for if jesus had given them rest  then would he not afterward have spoken of anoth day  4  9 there remaineth therefor a rest to the peopl of god  4  10 for he that is enter into his rest  he also hath ceas from his own work  as god did from his  4  11 let us labour therefor to enter into that rest  lest ani man fall after the same exampl of unbelief  4  12 for the word of god is quick  and power  and sharper than ani twoedg sword  pierc even to the divid asund of soul and spirit  and of the joint and marrow  and is a discern of the thought and intent of the heart  4  13 neither is there ani creatur that is not manifest in his sight  but all thing are nake and open unto the eye of him with whom we have to do  4  14 see then that we have a great high priest  that is pass into the heaven  jesus the son of god  let us hold fast our profess  4  15 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touch with the feel of our infirm  but was in all point tempt like as we are  yet without sin  4  16 let us therefor come bold unto the throne of grace  that we may obtain merci  and find grace to help in time of need  5  1 for everi high priest taken from among men is ordain for men in thing pertain to god  that he may offer both gift and sacrific for sin  5  2 who can have compass on the ignor  and on them that are out of the way  for that he himself also is compass with infirm  5  3 and by reason hereof he ought  as for the peopl  so also for himself  to offer for sin  5  4 and no man taketh this honour unto himself  but he that is call of god  as was aaron  5  5 so also christ glorifi not himself to be made an high priest  but he that said unto him  thou art my son  to day have i begotten thee  5  6 as he saith also in anoth place  thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  5  7 who in the day of his flesh  when he had offer up prayer and supplic with strong cri and tear unto him that was abl to save him from death  and was heard in that he fear  5  8 though he were a son  yet learn he obedi by the thing which he suffer  5  9 and be made perfect  he becam the author of etern salvat unto all them that obey him  5  10 call of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec  5  11 of whom we have mani thing to say  and hard to be utter  see ye are dull of hear  5  12 for when for the time ye ought to be teacher  ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principl of the oracl of god  and are becom such as have need of milk  and not of strong meat  5  13 for everi one that useth milk is unskil in the word of righteous  for he is a babe  5  14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age  even those who by reason of use have their sens exercis to discern both good and evil  6  1 therefor leav the principl of the doctrin of christ  let us go on unto perfect  not lay again the foundat of repent from dead work  and of faith toward god  6  2 of the doctrin of baptism  and of lay on of hand  and of resurrect of the dead  and of etern judgment  6  3 and this will we do  if god permit  6  4 for it is imposs for those who were onc enlighten  and have tast of the heaven gift  and were made partak of the holi ghost  6  5 and have tast the good word of god  and the power of the world to come  6  6 if they shall fall away  to renew them again unto repent  see they crucifi to themselv the son of god afresh  and put him to an open shame  6  7 for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it  and bringeth forth herb meet for them by whom it is dress  receiveth bless from god  6  8 but that which beareth thorn and brier is reject  and is nigh unto curs  whose end is to be burn  6  9 but  belov  we are persuad better thing of you  and thing that accompani salvat  though we thus speak  6  10 for god is not unright to forget your work and labour of love  which ye have shew toward his name  in that ye have minist to the saint  and do minist  6  11 and we desir that everi one of you do shew the same dilig to the full assur of hope unto the end  6  12 that ye be not sloth  but follow of them who through faith and patienc inherit the promis  6  13 for when god made promis to abraham  becaus he could swear by no greater  he sware by himself  6  14 say  sure bless i will bless thee  and multipli i will multipli thee  6  15 and so  after he had patient endur  he obtain the promis  6  16 for men verili swear by the greater  and an oath for confirm is to them an end of all strife  6  17 wherein god  will more abund to shew unto the heir of promis the immut of his counsel  confirm it by an oath  6  18 that by two immut thing  in which it was imposs for god to lie  we might have a strong consol  who have fled for refug to lay hold upon the hope set befor us  6  19 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul  both sure and stedfast  and which entereth into that within the veil  6  20 whither the forerunn is for us enter  even jesus  made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  7  1 for this melchisedec  king of salem  priest of the most high god  who met abraham return from the slaughter of the king  and bless him  7  2 to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all  first be by interpret king of righteous  and after that also king of salem  which is  king of peac  7  3 without father  without mother  without descent  have neither begin of day  nor end of life  but made like unto the son of god  abideth a priest continu  7  4 now consid how great this man was  unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoil  7  5 and verili they that are of the son of levi  who receiv the offic of the priesthood  have a command to take tith of the peopl accord to the law  that is  of their brethren  though they come out of the loin of abraham  7  6 but he whose descent is not count from them receiv tith of abraham  and bless him that had the promis  7  7 and without all contradict the less is bless of the better  7  8 and here men that die receiv tith  but there he receiveth them  of whom it is wit that he liveth  7  9 and as i may so say  levi also  who receiveth tith  pay tith in abraham  7  10 for he was yet in the loin of his father  when melchisedec met him  7  11 if therefor perfect were by the levit priesthood   for under it the peopl receiv the law  what further need was there that anoth priest should rise after the order of melchisedec  and not be call after the order of aaron  7  12 for the priesthood be chang  there is made of necess a chang also of the law  7  13 for he of whom these thing are spoken pertaineth to anoth tribe  of which no man gave attend at the altar  7  14 for it is evid that our lord sprang out of juda  of which tribe mose spake noth concern priesthood  7  15 and it is yet far more evid  for that after the similitud of melchisedec there ariseth anoth priest  7  16 who is made  not after the law of a carnal command  but after the power of an endless life  7  17 for he testifieth  thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  7  18 for there is verili a disannul of the command go befor for the weak and unprofit thereof  7  19 for the law made noth perfect  but the bring in of a better hope did  by the which we draw nigh unto god  7  20 and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest  7  21  for those priest were made without an oath  but this with an oath by him that said unto him  the lord sware and will not repent  thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  7  22 by so much was jesus made a sureti of a better testament  7  23 and they truli were mani priest  becaus they were not suffer to continu by reason of death  7  24 but this man  becaus he continueth ever  hath an unchang priesthood  7  25 wherefor he is abl also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him  see he ever liveth to make intercess for them  7  26 for such an high priest becam us  who is holi  harmless  undefil  separ from sinner  and made higher than the heaven  7  27 who needeth not daili  as those high priest  to offer up sacrific  first for his own sin  and then for the peopl  s  for this he did onc  when he offer up himself  7  28 for the law maketh men high priest which have infirm  but the word of the oath  which was sinc the law  maketh the son  who is consecr for evermor  8  1 now of the thing which we have spoken this is the sum  we have such an high priest  who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesti in the heaven  8  2 a minist of the sanctuari  and of the true tabernacl  which the lord pitch  and not man  8  3 for everi high priest is ordain to offer gift and sacrific  wherefor it is of necess that this man have somewhat also to offer  8  4 for if he were on earth  he should not be a priest  see that there are priest that offer gift accord to the law  8  5 who serv unto the exampl and shadow of heaven thing  as mose was admonish of god when he was about to make the tabernacl  for  see  saith he  that thou make all thing accord to the pattern shew to thee in the mount  8  6 but now hath he obtain a more excel ministri  by how much also he is the mediat of a better coven  which was establish upon better promis  8  7 for if that first coven had been faultless  then should no place have been sought for the second  8  8 for find fault with them  he saith  behold  the day come  saith the lord  when i will make a new coven with the hous of israel and with the hous of judah  8  9 not accord to the coven that i made with their father in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt  becaus they continu not in my coven  and i regard them not  saith the lord  8  10 for this is the coven that i will make with the hous of israel after those day  saith the lord  i will put my law into their mind  and write them in their heart  and i will be to them a god  and they shall be to me a peopl  8  11 and they shall not teach everi man his neighbour  and everi man his brother  say  know the lord  for all shall know me  from the least to the greatest  8  12 for i will be merci to their unright  and their sin and their iniqu will i rememb no more  8  13 in that he saith  a new coven  he hath made the first old  now that which decayeth and waxeth old is readi to vanish away  9  1 then verili the first coven had also ordin of divin servic  and a world sanctuari  9  2 for there was a tabernacl made  the first  wherein was the candlestick  and the tabl  and the shewbread  which is call the sanctuari  9  3 and after the second veil  the tabernacl which is call the holiest of all  9  4 which had the golden censer  and the ark of the coven overlaid round about with gold  wherein was the golden pot that had manna  and aaron  s rod that bud  and the tabl of the coven  9  5 and over it the cherubim of glori shadow the mercyseat  of which we cannot now speak particular  9  6 now when these thing were thus ordain  the priest went alway into the first tabernacl  accomplish the servic of god  9  7 but into the second went the high priest alon onc everi year  not without blood  which he offer for himself  and for the error of the peopl  9  8 the holi ghost this signifi  that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest  while as the first tabernacl was yet stand  9  9 which was a figur for the time then present  in which were offer both gift and sacrific  that could not make him that did the servic perfect  as pertain to the conscienc  9  10 which stood onli in meat and drink  and diver wash  and carnal ordin  impos on them until the time of reform  9  11 but christ be come an high priest of good thing to come  by a greater and more perfect tabernacl  not made with hand  that is to say  not of this build  9  12 neither by the blood of goat and calv  but by his own blood he enter in onc into the holi place  have obtain etern redempt for us  9  13 for if the blood of bull and of goat  and the ash of an heifer sprinkl the unclean  sanctifieth to the purifi of the flesh  9  14 how much more shall the blood of christ  who through the etern spirit offer himself without spot to god  purg your conscienc from dead work to serv the live god  9  15 and for this caus he is the mediat of the new testament  that by mean of death  for the redempt of the transgress that were under the first testament  they which are call might receiv the promis of etern inherit  9  16 for where a testament is  there must also of necess be the death of the testat  9  17 for a testament is of forc after men are dead  otherwis it is of no strength at all while the testat liveth  9  18 whereupon neither the first testament was dedic without blood  9  19 for when mose had spoken everi precept to all the peopl accord to the law  he took the blood of calv and of goat  with water  and scarlet wool  and hyssop  and sprinkl both the book  and all the peopl  9  20 say  this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoin unto you  9  21 moreov he sprinkl with blood both the tabernacl  and all the vessel of the ministri  9  22 and almost all thing are by the law purg with blood  and without shed of blood is no remiss  9  23 it was therefor necessari that the pattern of thing in the heaven should be purifi with these  but the heaven thing themselv with better sacrific than these  9  24 for christ is not enter into the holi place made with hand  which are the figur of the true  but into heaven itself  now to appear in the presenc of god for us  9  25 nor yet that he should offer himself often  as the high priest entereth into the holi place everi year with blood of other  9  26 for then must he often have suffer sinc the foundat of the world  but now onc in the end of the world hath he appear to put away sin by the sacrific of himself  9  27 and as it is appoint unto men onc to die  but after this the judgment  9  28 so christ was onc offer to bear the sin of mani  and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvat  10  1 for the law have a shadow of good thing to come  and not the veri imag of the thing  can never with those sacrific which they offer year by year continu make the comer thereunto perfect  10  2 for then would they not have ceas to be offer  becaus that the worshipp onc purg should have had no more conscienc of sin  10  3 but in those sacrific there is a remembr again made of sin everi year  10  4 for it is not possibl that the blood of bull and of goat should take away sin  10  5 wherefor when he cometh into the world  he saith  sacrific and offer thou wouldest not  but a bodi hast thou prepar me  10  6 in burnt offer and sacrific for sin thou hast had no pleasur  10  7 then said i  lo  i come  in the volum of the book it is written of me  to do thi will  o god  10  8 abov when he said  sacrific and offer and burnt offer and offer for sin thou wouldest not  neither hadst pleasur therein  which are offer by the law  10  9 then said he  lo  i come to do thi will  o god  he taketh away the first  that he may establish the second  10  10 by the which will we are sanctifi through the offer of the bodi of jesus christ onc for all  10  11 and everi priest standeth daili minist and offer oftentim the same sacrific  which can never take away sin  10  12 but this man  after he had offer one sacrific for sin for ever  sat down on the right hand of god  10  13 from henceforth expect till his enemi be made his footstool  10  14 for by one offer he hath perfect for ever them that are sanctifi  10  15 whereof the holi ghost also is a wit to us  for after that he had said befor  10  16 this is the coven that i will make with them after those day  saith the lord  i will put my law into their heart  and in their mind will i write them  10  17 and their sin and iniqu will i rememb no more  10  18 now where remiss of these is  there is no more offer for sin  10  19 have therefor  brethren  bold to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus  10  20 by a new and live way  which he hath consecr for us  through the veil  that is to say  his flesh  10  21 and have an high priest over the hous of god  10  22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assur of faith  have our heart sprinkl from an evil conscienc  and our bodi wash with pure water  10  23 let us hold fast the profess of our faith without waver   for he is faith that promis  10  24 and let us consid one anoth to provok unto love and to good work  10  25 not forsak the assembl of ourselv togeth  as the manner of some is  but exhort one anoth  and so much the more  as ye see the day approach  10  26 for if we sin wil after that we have receiv the knowledg of the truth  there remaineth no more sacrific for sin  10  27 but a certain fear look for of judgment and fieri indign  which shall devour the adversari  10  28 he that despis mose  law die without merci under two or three wit  10  29 of how much sorer punish  suppos ye  shall he be thought worthi  who hath trodden under foot the son of god  and hath count the blood of the coven  wherewith he was sanctifi  an unholi thing  and hath done despit unto the spirit of grace  10  30 for we know him that hath said  vengeanc belongeth unto me  i will recompens  saith the lord  and again  the lord shall judg his peopl  10  31 it is a fear thing to fall into the hand of the live god  10  32 but call to remembr the former day  in which  after ye were illumin  ye endur a great fight of afflict  10  33 part  whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproach and afflict  and part  whilst ye becam companion of them that were so use  10  34 for ye had compass of me in my bond  and took joy the spoil of your good  know in yourselv that ye have in heaven a better and an endur substanc  10  35 cast not away therefor your confid  which hath great recomp of reward  10  36 for ye have need of patienc  that  after ye have done the will of god  ye might receiv the promis  10  37 for yet a littl while  and he that shall come will come  and will not tarri  10  38 now the just shall live by faith  but if ani man draw back  my soul shall have no pleasur in him  10  39 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdit  but of them that believ to the save of the soul  11  1 now faith is the substanc of thing hope for  the evid of thing not seen  11  2 for by it the elder obtain a good report  11  3 through faith we understand that the world were frame by the word of god  so that thing which are seen were not made of thing which do appear  11  4 by faith abel offer unto god a more excel sacrific than cain  by which he obtain wit that he was righteous  god testifi of his gift  and by it he be dead yet speaketh  11  5 by faith enoch was translat that he should not see death  and was not found  becaus god had translat him  for befor his translat he had this testimoni  that he pleas god  11  6 but without faith it is imposs to pleas him  for he that cometh to god must believ that he is  and that he is a reward of them that dilig seek him  11  7 by faith noah  be warn of god of thing not seen as yet  move with fear  prepar an ark to the save of his hous  by the which he condemn the world  and becam heir of the righteous which is by faith  11  8 by faith abraham  when he was call to go out into a place which he should after receiv for an inherit  obey  and he went out  not know whither he went  11  9 by faith he sojourn in the land of promis  as in a strang countri  dwell in tabernacl with isaac and jacob  the heir with him of the same promis  11  10 for he look for a citi which hath foundat  whose builder and maker is god  11  11 through faith also sara herself receiv strength to conceiv seed  and was deliv of a child when she was past age  becaus she judg him faith who had promis  11  12 therefor sprang there even of one  and him as good as dead  so mani as the star of the sky in multitud  and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumer  11  13 these all die in faith  not have receiv the promis  but have seen them afar off  and were persuad of them  and embrac them  and confess that they were stranger and pilgrim on the earth  11  14 for they that say such thing declar plain that they seek a countri  11  15 and truli  if they had been mind of that countri from whenc they came out  they might have had opportun to have return  11  16 but now they desir a better countri  that is  an heaven  wherefor god is not asham to be call their god  for he hath prepar for them a citi  11  17 by faith abraham  when he was tri  offer up isaac  and he that had receiv the promis offer up his onli begotten son  11  18 of whom it was said  that in isaac shall thi seed be call  11  19 account that god was abl to rais him up  even from the dead  from whenc also he receiv him in a figur  11  20 by faith isaac bless jacob and esau concern thing to come  11  21 by faith jacob  when he was a die  bless both the son of joseph  and worship  lean upon the top of his staff  11  22 by faith joseph  when he die  made mention of the depart of the children of israel  and gave command concern his bone  11  23 by faith mose  when he was born  was hid three month of his parent  becaus they saw he was a proper child  and they were not afraid of the king  s command  11  24 by faith mose  when he was come to year  refus to be call the son of pharaoh  s daughter  11  25 choos rather to suffer afflict with the peopl of god  than to enjoy the pleasur of sin for a season  11  26 esteem the reproach of christ greater rich than the treasur in egypt  for he had respect unto the recomp of the reward  11  27 by faith he forsook egypt  not fear the wrath of the king  for he endur  as see him who is invis  11  28 through faith he kept the passov  and the sprinkl of blood  lest he that destroy the firstborn should touch them  11  29 by faith they pass through the red sea as by dri land  which the egyptian assay to do were drown  11  30 by faith the wall of jericho fell down  after they were compass about seven day  11  31 by faith the harlot rahab perish not with them that believ not  when she had receiv the spi with peac  11  32 and what shall i more say  for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon  and of barak  and of samson  and of jephtha  of david also  and samuel  and of the prophet  11  33 who through faith subdu kingdom  wrought righteous  obtain promis  stop the mouth of lion  11  34 quench the violenc of fire  escap the edg of the sword  out of weak were made strong  wax valiant in fight  turn to flight the armi of the alien  11  35 women receiv their dead rais to life again  and other were tortur  not accept deliver  that they might obtain a better resurrect  11  36 and other had trial of cruel mock and scourg  yea  moreov of bond and imprison  11  37 they were stone  they were sawn asund  were tempt  were slain with the sword  they wander about in sheepskin and goatskin  be destitut  afflict  torment  11  38  of whom the world was not worthi  they wander in desert  and in mountain  and in den and cave of the earth  11  39 and these all  have obtain a good report through faith  receiv not the promis  11  40 god have provid some better thing for us  that they without us should not be made perfect  12  1 wherefor see we also are compass about with so great a cloud of wit  let us lay asid everi weight  and the sin which doth so easili beset us  and let us run with patienc the race that is set befor us  12  2 look unto jesus the author and finish of our faith  who for the joy that was set befor him endur the cross  despis the shame  and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god  12  3 for consid him that endur such contradict of sinner against himself  lest ye be weari and faint in your mind  12  4 ye have not yet resist unto blood  strive against sin  12  5 and ye have forgotten the exhort which speaketh unto you as unto children  my son  despis not thou the chasten of the lord  nor faint when thou art rebuk of him  12  6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth  and scourgeth everi son whom he receiveth  12  7 if ye endur chasten  god dealeth with you as with son  for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not  12  8 but if ye be without chastis  whereof all are partak  then are ye bastard  and not son  12  9 furthermor we have had father of our flesh which correct us  and we gave them rever  shall we not much rather be in subject unto the father of spirit  and live  12  10 for they verili for a few day chasten us after their own pleasur  but he for our profit  that we might be partak of his holi  12  11 now no chasten for the present seemeth to be joyous  but grievous  nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceabl fruit of righteous unto them which are exercis therebi  12  12 wherefor lift up the hand which hang down  and the feebl knee  12  13 and make straight path for your feet  lest that which is lame be turn out of the way  but let it rather be heal  12  14 follow peac with all men  and holi  without which no man shall see the lord  12  15 look dilig lest ani man fail of the grace of god  lest ani root of bitter spring up troubl you  and therebi mani be defil  12  16 lest there be ani fornic  or profan person  as esau  who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright  12  17 for ye know how that afterward  when he would have inherit the bless  he was reject  for he found no place of repent  though he sought it care with tear  12  18 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touch  and that burn with fire  nor unto black  and dark  and tempest  12  19 and the sound of a trumpet  and the voic of word  which voic they that heard intreat that the word should not be spoken to them ani more  12  20  for they could not endur that which was command  and if so much as a beast touch the mountain  it shall be stone  or thrust through with a dart  12  21 and so terribl was the sight  that mose said  i exceed fear and quak  12  22 but ye are come unto mount sion  and unto the citi of the live god  the heaven jerusalem  and to an innumer compani of angel  12  23 to the general assembl and church of the firstborn  which are written in heaven  and to god the judg of all  and to the spirit of just men made perfect  12  24 and to jesus the mediat of the new coven  and to the blood of sprinkl  that speaketh better thing than that of abel  12  25 see that ye refus not him that speaketh  for if they escap not who refus him that spake on earth  much more shall not we escap  if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven  12  26 whose voic then shook the earth  but now he hath promis  say  yet onc more i shake not the earth onli  but also heaven  12  27 and this word  yet onc more  signifieth the remov of those thing that are shaken  as of thing that are made  that those thing which cannot be shaken may remain  12  28 wherefor we receiv a kingdom which cannot be move  let us have grace  wherebi we may serv god accept with rever and god fear  12  29 for our god is a consum fire  13  1 let brother love continu  13  2 be not forget to entertain stranger  for therebi some have entertain angel unawar  13  3 rememb them that are in bond  as bound with them  and them which suffer advers  as be yourselv also in the bodi  13  4 marriag is honour in all  and the bed undefil  but whoremong and adulter god will judg  13  5 let your convers be without covet  and be content with such thing as ye have  for he hath said  i will never leav thee  nor forsak thee  13  6 so that we may bold say  the lord is my helper  and i will not fear what man shall do unto me  13  7 rememb them which have the rule over you  who have spoken unto you the word of god  whose faith follow  consid the end of their convers  13  8 jesus christ the same yesterday  and to day  and for ever  13  9 be not carri about with diver and strang doctrin  for it is a good thing that the heart be establish with grace  not with meat  which have not profit them that have been occupi therein  13  10 we have an altar  whereof they have no right to eat which serv the tabernacl  13  11 for the bodi of those beast  whose blood is brought into the sanctuari by the high priest for sin  are burn without the camp  13  12 wherefor jesus also  that he might sanctifi the peopl with his own blood  suffer without the gate  13  13 let us go forth therefor unto him without the camp  bear his reproach  13  14 for here have we no continu citi  but we seek one to come  13  15 by him therefor let us offer the sacrific of prais to god continu  that is  the fruit of our lip give thank to his name  13  16 but to do good and to communic forget not  for with such sacrific god is well pleas  13  17 obey them that have the rule over you  and submit yourselv  for they watch for your soul  as they that must give account  that they may do it with joy  and not with grief  for that is unprofit for you  13  18 pray for us  for we trust we have a good conscienc  in all thing will to live honest  13  19 but i beseech you the rather to do this  that i may be restor to you the sooner  13  20 now the god of peac  that brought again from the dead our lord jesus  that great shepherd of the sheep  through the blood of the everlast coven  13  21 make you perfect in everi good work to do his will  work in you that which is wellpleas in his sight  through jesus christ  to whom be glori for ever and ever  amen  13  22 and i beseech you  brethren  suffer the word of exhort  for i have written a letter unto you in few word  13  23 know ye that our brother timothi is set at liberti  with whom  if he come short  i will see you  13  24 salut all them that have the rule over you  and all the saint  they of itali salut you  13  25 grace be with you all  amen  the general epistl of jame 1  1 jame  a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ  to the twelv tribe which are scatter abroad  greet  1  2 my brethren  count it all joy when ye fall into diver temptat  1  3 know this  that the tri of your faith worketh patienc  1  4 but let patienc have her perfect work  that ye may be perfect and entir  want noth  1  5 if ani of you lack wisdom  let him ask of god  that giveth to all men liber  and upbraideth not  and it shall be given him  1  6 but let him ask in faith  noth waver  for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss  1  7 for let not that man think that he shall receiv ani thing of the lord  1  8 a doubl mind man is unstabl in all his way  1  9 let the brother of low degre rejoic in that he is exalt  1  10 but the rich  in that he is made low  becaus as the flower of the grass he shall pass away  1  11 for the sun is no sooner risen with a burn heat  but it withereth the grass  and the flower thereof falleth  and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth  so also shall the rich man fade away in his way  1  12 bless is the man that endureth temptat  for when he is tri  he shall receiv the crown of life  which the lord hath promis to them that love him  1  13 let no man say when he is tempt  i am tempt of god  for god cannot be tempt with evil  neither tempteth he ani man  1  14 but everi man is tempt  when he is drawn away of his own lust  and entic  1  15 then when lust hath conceiv  it bringeth forth sin  and sin  when it is finish  bringeth forth death  1  16 do not err  my belov brethren  1  17 everi good gift and everi perfect gift is from abov  and cometh down from the father of light  with whom is no variabl  neither shadow of turn  1  18 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth  that we should be a kind of firstfruit of his creatur  1  19 wherefor  my belov brethren  let everi man be swift to hear  slow to speak  slow to wrath  1  20 for the wrath of man worketh not the righteous of god  1  21 wherefor lay apart all filthi and superflu of naughti  and receiv with meek the engraft word  which is abl to save your soul  1  22 but be ye doer of the word  and not hearer onli  deceiv your own selv  1  23 for if ani be a hearer of the word  and not a doer  he is like unto a man behold his natur face in a glass  1  24 for he beholdeth himself  and goeth his way  and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was  1  25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberti  and continueth therein  he be not a forget hearer  but a doer of the work  this man shall be bless in his deed  1  26 if ani man among you seem to be religi  and bridleth not his tongu  but deceiveth his own heart  this man  s religion is vain  1  27 pure religion and undefil befor god and the father is this  to visit the fatherless and widow in their afflict  and to keep himself unspot from the world  2  1 my brethren  have not the faith of our lord jesus christ  the lord of glori  with respect of person  2  2 for if there come unto your assembl a man with a gold ring  in good apparel  and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment  2  3 and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay cloth  and say unto him  sit thou here in a good place  and say to the poor  stand thou there  or sit here under my footstool  2  4 are ye not then partial in yourselv  and are becom judg of evil thought  2  5 hearken  my belov brethren  hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith  and heir of the kingdom which he hath promis to them that love him  2  6 but ye have despis the poor  do not rich men oppress you  and draw you befor the judgment seat  2  7 do not they blasphem that worthi name by the which ye are call  2  8 if ye fulfil the royal law accord to the scriptur  thou shalt love thi neighbour as thyself  ye do well  2  9 but if ye have respect to person  ye commit sin  and are convinc of the law as transgressor  2  10 for whosoev shall keep the whole law  and yet offend in one point  he is guilti of all  2  11 for he that said  do not commit adulteri  said also  do not kill  now if thou commit no adulteri  yet if thou kill  thou art becom a transgressor of the law  2  12 so speak ye  and so do  as they that shall be judg by the law of liberti  2  13 for he shall have judgment without merci  that hath shew no merci  and merci rejoiceth against judgment  2  14 what doth it profit  my brethren  though a man say he hath faith  and have not work  can faith save him  2  15 if a brother or sister be nake  and destitut of daili food  2  16 and one of you say unto them  depart in peac  be ye warm and fill  notwithstand ye give them not those thing which are need to the bodi  what doth it profit  2  17 even so faith  if it hath not work  is dead  be alon  2  18 yea  a man may say  thou hast faith  and i have work  shew me thi faith without thi work  and i will shew thee my faith by my work  2  19 thou believest that there is one god  thou doest well  the devil also believ  and trembl  2  20 but wilt thou know  o vain man  that faith without work is dead  2  21 was not abraham our father justifi by work  when he had offer isaac his son upon the altar  2  22 seest thou how faith wrought with his work  and by work was faith made perfect  2  23 and the scriptur was fulfil which saith  abraham believ god  and it was imput unto him for righteous  and he was call the friend of god  2  24 ye see then how that by work a man is justifi  and not by faith onli  2  25 likewis also was not rahab the harlot justifi by work  when she had receiv the messeng  and had sent them out anoth way  2  26 for as the bodi without the spirit is dead  so faith without work is dead also  3  1 my brethren  be not mani master  know that we shall receiv the greater condemn  3  2 for in mani thing we offend all  if ani man offend not in word  the same is a perfect man  and abl also to bridl the whole bodi  3  3 behold  we put bit in the hors  mouth  that they may obey us  and we turn about their whole bodi  3  4 behold also the ship  which though they be so great  and are driven of fierc wind  yet are they turn about with a veri small helm  whithersoev the governor listeth  3  5 even so the tongu is a littl member  and boasteth great thing  behold  how great a matter a littl fire kindleth  3  6 and the tongu is a fire  a world of iniqu  so is the tongu among our member  that it defileth the whole bodi  and setteth on fire the cours of natur  and it is set on fire of hell  3  7 for everi kind of beast  and of bird  and of serpent  and of thing in the sea  is tame  and hath been tame of mankind  3  8 but the tongu can no man tame  it is an unruli evil  full of dead poison  3  9 therewith bless we god  even the father  and therewith curs we men  which are made after the similitud of god  3  10 out of the same mouth proceedeth bless and curs  my brethren  these thing ought not so to be  3  11 doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter  3  12 can the fig tree  my brethren  bear oliv berri  either a vine  fig  so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh  3  13 who is a wise man and endu with knowledg among you  let him shew out of a good convers his work with meek of wisdom  3  14 but if ye have bitter envi and strife in your heart  glori not  and lie not against the truth  3  15 this wisdom descendeth not from abov  but is earth  sensual  devilish  3  16 for where envi and strife is  there is confus and everi evil work  3  17 but the wisdom that is from abov is first pure  then peaceabl  gentl  and easi to be intreat  full of merci and good fruit  without partial  and without hypocrisi  3  18 and the fruit of righteous is sown in peac of them that make peac  4  1 from whenc come war and fight among you  come they not henc  even of your lust that war in your member  4  2 ye lust  and have not  ye kill  and desir to have  and cannot obtain  ye fight and war  yet ye have not  becaus ye ask not  4  3 ye ask  and receiv not  becaus ye ask amiss  that ye may consum it upon your lust  4  4 ye adulter and adulteress  know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmiti with god  whosoev therefor will be a friend of the world is the enemi of god  4  5 do ye think that the scriptur saith in vain  the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envi  4  6 but he giveth more grace  wherefor he saith  god resisteth the proud  but giveth grace unto the humbl  4  7 submit yourselv therefor to god  resist the

we heard  when we were with him in the holi mount  1  19 we have also a more sure word of propheci  whereunto ye do well that ye take heed  as unto a light that shineth in a dark place  until the day

men of god spake as they were move by the holi ghost  2  1 but there were fals prophet also among the peopl  even as there shall be fals teacher among you  who privili shall bring in damnabl heresi  even deni the lord that bought them  and bring upon themselv swift destruct  2  2 and mani shall follow their pernici way  by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of  2  3 and through covet shall they with feign word make merchandis of you  whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not  and their damnat slumbereth not  2  4 for if god spare not the angel that sin  but cast them down to hell  and deliv them into chain of dark  to be reserv unto judgment  2  5 and spare not the old world  but save noah the eighth person  a preacher of righteous  bring in the flood upon the

the god out of temptat  and to reserv the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punish  2  10 but chiefli them that walk after the flesh in the lust of unclean  and despis govern  presumptu are they  selfwil  they are not afraid to speak evil of digniti  2  11 wherea angel  which are greater in power and might  bring not rail accus against them befor the lord  2  12 but these  as natur brute beast  made to be taken and destroy  speak evil of the thing that they understand not  and shall utter perish in their own corrupt  2  13 and shall receiv the reward of unright  as they that count it

error  2  19 while they promis them liberti  they themselv are the servant of corrupt  for of whom a man is overcom  of the same is he brought in bondag  2  20 for if after they have escap the pollut of the world through the knowledg of the lord and saviour jesus christ  they are again entangl therein  and overcom  the latter end is wors with them than the begin  2  21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteous  than  after they have known it  to turn from the holi command deliv unto them  2  22 but it is happen unto them accord to the true proverb  the dog is turn to his own vomit again  and the sow that was wash to her wallow in the mire  3  1 this second epistl  belov  i now write unto you  in both which i stir up your pure mind by way of remembr  3  2 that

ignor of  that by the word of god the heaven were of old  and the earth stand out of the water and in the water  3  6 wherebi the world that then was  be overflow with water  perish  3  7 but the heaven and the earth  which are now  by the same word are kept in store  reserv unto fire against the day of judgment and perdit of ungod men  3  8 but  belov  be not ignor of this one thing  that one day is with the lord as a thousand year  and a thousand year as one day  3  9 the lord is not slack concern his promis  as some men count slack  but is longsuff to us  ward  not will that ani should perish  but that all should come to repent  3  10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night  in the which the heaven shall pass away with a great nois  and the element shall melt with fervent heat  the earth also and the work that are therein shall be burn up  3  11 see then that all these thing shall be dissolv  what manner of person ought ye to be in all holi convers and godli  3  12 look for and hast unto the come of the day of god  wherein the heaven be on fire shall be dissolv  and the element shall melt with fervent heat  3  13 nevertheless we  accord to his promis  look

for love is of god  and everi one that loveth is born of god  and knoweth god  4  8 he that loveth not knoweth not god  for god is love  4  9 in this was manifest the love of god toward us  becaus that god sent his onli begotten son into the world  that we might live through him  4  10 herein is love  not that we love god  but that he love us  and sent his son to be the propiti for our sin  4  11 belov  if god so love us  we ought also to love one anoth  4  12 no man hath seen god at ani time  if we love one anoth  god dwelleth in us  and his love is perfect in us  4  13 herebi know we that we dwell in him  and he in us  becaus he hath given us of his spirit  4  14 and we have seen and do testifi that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world  4  15 whosoev shall confess

him  4  17 herein is our love made perfect  that we may have bold in the day of judgment  becaus as he is  so are we in this world  4  18 there is no fear in love  but perfect love casteth out fear  becaus fear hath torment  he that feareth is not made perfect in love  4  19 we love him  becaus he first love us  4  20 if a man say  i love god  and hateth his brother  he is a liar  for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen  how can he love god whom he hath not seen  4  21 and this command have we from him  that he who loveth god love his brother also  5  1 whosoev believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god  and everi one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him  5  2 by this we know that we love the children of god  when we love god  and keep

by water onli  but by water and blood  and it is the spirit that beareth wit  becaus the spirit is truth  5  7 for there are three that bear record in heaven  the father  the word  and the holi ghost  and these three are one  5  8 and there are three that bear wit in earth  the spirit  and the water  and the blood  and these three agre in one  5  9 if we receiv the wit of men  the wit of god is greater  for this is the wit of god which he hath testifi of his son  5  10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the wit in himself  he that believeth not god hath made him a liar  becaus he believeth not the record that god gave of his son  5  11 and this is the record  that god hath given to us etern life  and this life is in his son  5  12 he that hath the son hath life  and he that hath not the son of god hath not life  5  13 these thing have i written unto you that believ on the name of the son of god  that ye may know that ye have etern life  and that ye may believ on the name

have the petit that we desir of him  5  16 if ani man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death  he shall ask  and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death  there is a sin unto death  i do not say that he shall pray for it  5  17 all unright is sin  and there is a sin not unto death  5  18 we know that whosoev is born of god sinneth not  but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself  and that wick one toucheth him not  5  19 and we know that we are of god  and the whole world lieth in wicked  5  20 and we know that the son of god is come  and hath given us an
