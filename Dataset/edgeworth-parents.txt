it was scarc visibl to the nake eye  though it was easili to be seen through a magnifi glass  they also beg that their father  who was well acquaint with mr  harvey  the gentleman to whom rossmor castl belong  to write to him  and tell him how well these orphan had behav about the treasur which they had found  the valu of the coin was estim at about thirti or forti guinea  a few day after the fall of the chimney at rossmor castl  as mari and her sister were sit at their work  there came hobbl in an old woman  lean on a crab stick  that seem to have been newli cut  she had a broken tobacco  pipe in her mouth  her head was wrap up in two larg red and blue handkerchief  with their crook corner hang far down over the back of her neck  no shoe on her broad feet  nor stock on her mani  colour leg  her petticoat was jag at the bottom  and the skirt of her gown turn up over her shoulder  to serv instead of a cloak  which she had sold for whiski  this old woman was well known amongst the countri peopl by the name of goodi grope  becaus she had  for mani year  been in the habit of grope in old castl  and in moat  and at the bottom of a round tower  in the neighbourhood  in search of treasur  in her youth she had heard someon talk  in a whisper  of an old propheci  found in a bog  which said that befor mani  st  patrick  s day should come about  there would be found a treasur under ground  by one within twenti mile round  this propheci made a deep impress upon her  she also dream of it three time  and as the dream  she thought  was a sure token that the propheci was to come true  she  from that time forward  gave up her spin  wheel and her knit  and could think of noth but hunt for the treasur  that was to be found by one  within twenti mile round   goodi is not a word use in ireland  collyogh is the irish appel of an old woman  but as collyogh might sound strang to english ear  we have translat it by the word goodi   what are in ireland call moat  are  in england  call danish mound  or barrow   near kell  in ireland  there is a round tower  which was in immin danger of be pull down by an old woman  s root at it foundat  in hope of find treasur  year after year st  patrick  s day came about  without her ever find a farth by all her grope  and as she was alway idl  she grew poorer and poorer  besid  to comfort herself for her disappoint  and to give her spirit for fresh search  she took to drink  she sold all she had by degre  but still she fanci that the lucki day would come sooner or later  that would pay for all  goodi grope  howev  reach her sixtieth year  without ever see this lucki day  and now  in her old age  she was a beggar  without a hous to shelter her  a bed to lie on  or food to put into her mouth  but what she beg from the chariti of those who had trust more than she had to industri and less to luck   ah  mari  honey  give me a potato and a sup of someth  for the love o  merci  for not a bit have i had all day  except half a glass of whiski and a halfpenni worth of tobacco  mari immedi set befor her some milk  and pick a good potato out of the bowl for her  she was sorri to see such an old woman in such a wretch condit  goodi grope said she would rather have spirit of some kind or other than milk  but mari had no spirit to give her  so she sat herself down close to the fire  and after she had sigh and groan and smoke for some time  she said to mari   well  and what have you done with the treasur you had the luck to find  mari told her that she had carri it to mr  hopkin  the agent   that  s not what i would have done in your place  repli the old woman   when good luck came to you  what a shame to turn your back upon it  but it is idl talk of what  s done  that  s past  but i  ll tri my luck in this here castl befor next st  patrick  s day come about  i was told it was more than twenti mile from our bog or i would have been here long ago  but better late than never  mari was much alarm  and not without reason  at this speech  for she knew that if goodi grope onc set to work at the foundat of the old castl of rossmor  she would soon bring it all down  it was in vain to talk to goodi grope of the danger of buri herself under the ruin  or of the improb of her meet with anoth pot of gold coin  she set her elbow upon her knee  and stop her ear with her hand bid mari and her sister not to wast their breath advis their elder  for that  let them say what they would  she would fall to work the next morn   bar you  ll make it worth my while to let it alon   and what will make it worth your while to let it alon  said mari  for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habit  or compli with the condit of this provok old woman  half a crown  goodi grope said  was the least she could be content to take  mari paid the half  crown  and was in hope that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor  but she was mistaken  for scarc was the week at an end befor the old

to clifton in search of the old woman  to inquir where she found her sparkl stone  but it was too earli in the morn  the old woman was not at her seat  so he turn back again  disappoint  he did not wast his time wait for her  but saddl and bridl lightfoot  and went to farmer truck  s for the giant strawberri  a great part of the morn was spent in put them into the ground  and  as soon as that was finish  he set out again in quest of the old woman  whom  to his great joy  he spi sit at her corner of the street with her board befor her  but this old woman was deaf and cross  and when at last jem made her hear his question  he could get no answer from her  but that she found the fossil where he would never find ani more   but can  t i look where you look   look away  nobodi hinder you  repli the old woman  and these were the onli word she would say  jem was not  howev  a boy to be easili discourag  he went to the rock  and walk slowli along  look at all the stone as he pass  present he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosen some larg rock  and one amongst the workmen was stoop down look for someth veri eager  jem ran up  and ask if he could help him   yes  said

have touch mrs  pomfret  if felix  with a sneer  had not call them crocodil tear   felix  too  thought he   this is too much  in fact  felix had till now profess himself his firm alli  and had on his part receiv from franklin unequivoc proof of friendship  for it must be told that everi other morn  when it was felix  s turn to get breakfast  felix never was up in decent time  and must inevit have

answer felix  so confus that he knew not what to say   but   but what  cri mrs  pomfret  indign flash from her eye   but what  repeat his mistress  wait for his repli with a calm air of attent  which still more disconcert felix  for  though with an angri person he might have some chanc of escap  he knew that he could not invent ani excus in such circumst  which could stand the examin of a person in her sober sens  he was struck dumb   speak  said mrs  churchil  in a still lower tone   i am readi to hear all you have to say  in my hous everybodi shall have justic  speak  but what   but  stammer felix  and  after in vain attempt to equivoc  confess that he was go to take the turkey to his cousin  s  but he threw all the blame upon his aunt  the cook  who  he said  had order him upon this expedit  the cook was now summon  but she total deni all knowledg of the affair  with the same violenc with which she had late confound franklin about the beef in the basket  not entir  howev

speech  but the conclud word explain to her the mysteri  some year befor this time  when susan was a veri littl girl  and could scarc speak plain  as she was eat a basin of bread and milk for her supper at the cottag door  a great pig came up  and put his nose into the basin  susan was will that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk  but as she ate with a spoon and he with his larg mouth  she present discov that he was like to have more than his share  and in a simpl tone of expostul she said to him   take a poon  pig  the say becom proverbi in the villag  susan  s littl companion repeat it  and appli it upon mani occas  whenev anyon claim more than his share of anyth good  barbara  who was then not miss barbara  but plain bab  and who had play with all the poor children in the neighbourhood  was often reprov in her unjust method of divis by susan  s proverb  susan  as she grew up  forgot the childish say  but the remembr of it rankl in barbara  s mind  and it was to this that she suspect susan had allud  when she recommend a spoon to her  whilst she was swallow the basin of broth   this is a true anecdot   la  miss  said barbara  s maid  when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from susan  s   i onli wonder you did her the honour to set your foot within her door  what need have you to troubl her for news about the abbey folk  when your own papa has been there all the morn  and is just come in  and can tell you everyth  barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the abbey that morn  for attorney case was mysteri even to his own famili about his morn ride  he never chose to be ask where he was go  or where he had been  and this made his servant more than common inquisit to trace him  barbara  against whose appar childish and real cun he was not suffici on his guard  had often the art of draw him into convers about his visit  she ran into her father  s parlour  but she knew  the moment she saw his face  that it was no time to ask question  his pen was across his mouth  and his brown wig push obliqu upon his contract forehead  the wig was alway push crook whenev he was in a brown or rather  a black studi  barbara  who did not  like susan  bear with her father  s testi humour from affect and gentl of disposit  but who alway humour him from artific  tri all her skill to fathom his thought  and when she found that it would not do  she went to tell her maid so  and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bear him  it is true that attorney case was not in the happiest mood possibl  for he was by no mean satisfi with his morn  s work at the abbey  sir arthur somer  the new man  did not suit him  and he began to be rather apprehens that he should not suit sir arthur  he had sound reason for his doubt  sir arthur somer was an excel lawyer  and a perfect honest man  this seem to our attorney a contradict in term  in the cours of his practic the case had not occur  and he had no preced readi to direct his proceed  sir arthur was also a man of wit and eloqu  yet of plain deal and human  the attorney could not persuad himself to believ that his benevol was anyth but enlighten cun  and his plain deal he one minut dread as the masterpiec of art  and the next despis as the characterist of folli  in short  he had not yet decid whether he was an honest man or a knave  he had settl account with him for his late agenc  and had talk about sundri matter of busi  he constant perceiv  howev  that he could not impos upon sir arthur  but the idea that he could know all the maze of the law  and yet prefer the straight road  was incomprehens  mr  case  have paid sir arthur some compliment on his great legal abil  and his high reput at the bar  he coolli repli   i have left the bar  the attorney look in unfeign astonish  that a man who was actual make 3  ooo pound per annum at the bar should leav it   i am come  said sir arthur   to enjoy that kind of domest life in the countri which i prefer to all other  and amongst peopl whose happi i hope to increas  at this speech the attorney chang his ground  flatter himself that he should find his man avers to busi  and ignor of countri affair  he talk of the valu of land  and of new leas  sir arthur wish to enlarg his domain  and to make a ride round it  a map of it was lie upon the tabl  and farmer price  s garden came exact across the new road for the ride  sir arthur look disappoint  and the keen attorney seiz the moment to inform him that  price  s whole land was at his dispos   at my dispos  how so  cri sir arthur  eager   it will not be out of leas  i believ  these ten year  i  ll look into the rent roll again  perhap i am mistaken   you are mistaken  my good sir  and you are not mistaken  said mr  case  with a shrewd smile   in one sens  the land will not be out of leas these ten year  and in anoth it is out of leas at this present time  to come to the point at onc  the leas is  ab origin  null and void  i have detect a capit flaw in the bodi of it  i pledg my credit upon it  sir  it can  t stand a singl term in law or equiti  the attorney observ  that at these word sir arthur  s eye was fix with a look of earnest attent   now i have him  said the cun tempter to himself   neither in law nor equiti  repeat sir arthur  with appar incredul   are you sure of that  mr  case   sure  as i told you befor  sir  i  d pledg my whole credit upon the thing  i  d stake my exist   that  s someth  said sir arthur  as if he was ponder upon the matter  the attorney went on with all the eager of a keen man  who see a chanc at one stroke of win a rich friend  and of ruin a poor enemi  he explain  with legal volubl and technic amplif  the natur of the mistak in mr  price  s leas   it was  sir  said he   a leas for the life of peter price  susanna his wife  and to the survivor or survivor of them  or for the full time and term of twenti year  to be comput from the first day of may then next ensu  now  sir  this  you see  is a leas in revers  which the late sir benjamin somer had not  by his settlement  a right to make  this is a curious mistak  you see  sir arthur  and in fill up those print leas there  s alway a good chanc of some flaw  i find it perpetu  but i never found a better than this in the whole cours of my practic  sir arthur stood in silenc   my dear sir  said the attorney  take him by the button   you have no scrupl of stir in this busi   a littl  said sir arthur   whi  then  that can be done away in a moment  your name shall not appear in it at all  you have noth to do but to make over the leas to me  i make all safe to you with my bond  now  be in possess  i come forward in my own proper person  shall i proceed   no  you have said enough  repli sir arthur   the case  inde  lie in a nutshel  said the attorney  who had by this time work himself up to such a pitch of profession enthusiasm  that  intent upon his vision of a lawsuit  he total forgot to observ the impress his word made upon sir arthur   there  s onli one thing we have forgotten all this time  said sir arthur   what can that be  sir   that we shall ruin this poor man  case was thunderstruck at these word  or rather  by the look which accompani them  he recollect that he had laid himself open befor he was sure of sir arthur  s real charact  he soften  and said he should have had certain more consider in the case of ani but a litigi  pig  head fellow  as he knew price to be   if he be litigi  said sir arthur   i shall certain be glad to get him fair out of the parish as soon as possibl  when you go home  you will be so good  sir  as to send me his leas  that i may satisfi myself befor we stir in this busi  the attorney  brighten up  prepar to take leav  but he could not persuad himself to take his departur without make one push at sir arthur about the agenc   i will not troubl you  sir arthur  with this leas of price  s  said case   i  ll leav it with your agent  whom shall i appli to   to myself  sir  if you pleas  repli sir arthur  the courtier of loui the fourteenth could not have look more astound than our attorney  when they receiv from their monarch a similar answer  it was this unexpect repli of sir arthur  s which had derang the temper of mr  case  and caus his wig to stand so crook upon his forehead  and which had render him impenetr silent to his inquisit daughter barbara  after have walk up and down his room  convers with himself  for some time  the attorney conclud that the agenc must be given to somebodi when sir arthur should have to attend his duti in parliament  that the agenc  even for the winter season  was not a thing to be neglect  and that  if he manag well  he might yet secur it for himself  he had often found that small time present work wonder upon his own mind  and he judg of other by himself  the tenant had been in the reluct but constant practic of make him continu petti offer  and he resolv to tri the same cours with sir arthur  whose resolut to be his own agent  he thought  argu a close  save  avarici disposit  he had heard the housekeep at the abbey inquir  as he pass through the servant  whether there was

heard from her maid  who had heard from the  prentic of a shrewsburi millin  was the thing in london  and she was much surpris and disappoint  when she was shown into the room where the miss somers and the ladi of the abbey were sit  to see that they did not  in ani one part of their dress  agre with the pictur her imagin had form of fashion ladi  she was embarrass when she saw book and work and draw upon the tabl  and she began to think that some affront was meant to her  becaus the compani did not sit with their hand befor them  when miss somer endeavour to find out convers that would interest her  and spoke of walk and flower and garden  of which she was herself fond  miss barbara still thought herself undervalu  and soon contriv to expos her ignor most complet  by talk of thing which she did not understand  those who never attempt to appear what they are not  those who do not in their manner pretend to anyth unsuit to their habit and situat in life  never are in danger of be laugh at by sensibl  well bred peopl of ani rank  but affect is the constant and just object of ridicul  miss barbara case  with her mistaken air of gentil  aim to be thought a woman  and a fine ladi  whilst she was  in realiti  a child and a vulgar attorney  s daughter  render herself so thorough ridicul  that the good natur  yet discern spectat were pain divid between their sens of comic absurd and a feel of shame for one who could feel noth for herself  one by one the ladi drop off  miss somer went out of the room for a few minut to alter her dress  as it was the custom of the famili  befor dinner  she left a portfolio of pretti draw and good print  for miss barbara  s amus  but miss barbara  s thought were so intent upon the harper  ball  that she could not be entertain with such trifl  how unhappi are those who spend their time in expect  they can never enjoy the present moment  whilst barbara was contriv mean of interest miss somer in her favour  she recollect  with surpris  that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea  hen  mrs  betti  in the hurri of her dress her young ladi in the morn  had forgotten it  but it came just whilst miss somer was dress  and

 to be sure  for that matter  but i hope you don  t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifl or so   the fact is  said sir arthur   i had heard you were a litigi  pig  head fellow  but you do not seem to deserv this charact   hope not  sir  said the farmer   but about the matter of the land  i don  t want to take ani advantag of your wish for it  you are welcom to

heard of the word from attorney case  and  i take it  a flaw is neither more nor less than a mistak  as one should say  now  by reason a man doe not make a mistak on purpos  it seem to me to be the fair thing  that if a man find out his mistak  he might set it right  but attorney case say this is not law  and i  ve no more to say  the man who drew up my leas made a mistak  and if i must suffer for it  i must  said the farmer   howev  i can show you  sir arthur  just for my own satisfact and your  a few line of a memorandum on a slip of paper  which was given me by your relat  the gentleman who live here befor  and let me my farm  you  ll see  by that bit of paper  what was meant  but the attorney say  the paper  s not worth a button in a court of justic  and i don  t understand these

to look for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up  the parcel was but loos fold up  and as the impati man lift it  the weight of the pea which were withinsid of it burst the paper  and all the seed fell out upon the floor  whilst mauric in vain held his hand to catch them  the pea roll to all part of the shop  the impati man swore at them  but mauric  without be out of humour  set about collect them as fast as possibl  whilst the boy was busi in this manner  the man got what seed he want  and as he was talk about them  a sailor came into the shop  and said   captain  the wind has chang within these five minut  and it look as if we should have ugli weather   well  i  m glad of it  repli the rough face man  who was the captain of a ship   i am glad to have a day longer to stay ashor  and i  ve busi enough on my hand  the captain push forward toward the shop door  mauric  who was kneel on the floor  pick up his seed  saw that the captain  s foot was entangl in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood  mauric saw that  if the captain took one more step forward  he must pull the string  so that it would throw down the jar  round the bottom of which the packthread was entangl  he immedi caught hold of the captain  s leg  and stop him   stay  stand still  sir  said he   or you will break your china jar  the man stood still  look  and saw how the packthread had caught in his shoe buckl  and how it was near drag down his beauti china jar   i am realli veri much oblig to you  my littl fellow  said he   you have save my jar

to reach down that china jar for me  the shopman lift down the jar veri care  and the captain took off the cover  and pull out some tulip root   you seem  by the quantiti of seed you have got  to belong to a garden  are you fond of garden  said he to mauric   yes  sir  repli mauric   veri fond of it  for my father is a garden  and he let me help him at his work  and he has given me a littl garden of my own   then here are a coupl of tulip  root for you  and if you take care of them  i  ll promis you that you will have the finest tulip in england in your littl garden  these tulip were given to me by a dutch merchant  who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in holland  they will prosper with you  i  m sure  wind and weather permit  mauric thank the gentleman  and return home  eager to show his precious tulip  root to his father  and to a companion of his  the son of a nurseryman  who live near him  arthur was the name of the nurseryman  s son  the first thing mauric did  after show his tulip  root to his father  was to run to arthur  s garden in search of him  their garden were separ onli by a low wall of loos stone   arthur  arthur  where are you  are you in your garden  i want you  but arthur made no answer  and did not  as usual  come run to meet his friend   i know where you are  continu mauric   and i  m come to you as fast as the raspberri  bush will let me  i have good news for you  someth you  ll be delight to see  arthur  ha  but here is someth that i am not delight to see  i am sure  said poor mauric  who  when he had got through the raspberri  bush  and had come in sight of his own garden  beheld his bell  glass  his belov bell  glass  under which his cucumb were grown so fine  his onli bell  glass  broken to piec   i am sorri for it  said arthur  who stood lean upon his spade in his own garden   i am afraid you will be veri angri with me   whi  was it you  arthur  broke my bell  glass  oh  how could you do so   i was throw weed and rubbish over the wall  and by accid a great lump of couch  grass  with stone hang to the root  fell upon your bell  glass  and broke it  as you see  mauric lift up the lump of couch  grass  which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumb  and he look at his cucumb for a moment in silenc  oh  my poor cucumb  you must all die now  i shall see all your yellow flower wither tomorrow  but it is done  and it cannot be help  so  arthur  let us say no more about it   you are veri good  i thought you would have been angri  i am sure i should have been exceed angri if you had broken the glass  if it had been mine   oh  forgiv and forget  as my father alway say  that  s the best way  look what i have got for you  then he told arthur the stori of the captain of the ship  and the china jar  the seed have been thrown down  and of the fine tulip  root which had been given to him  and mauric conclud by offer one of the precious root to arthur  who thank him with great joy  and repeat said   how good you were not to be angri with me for break your bell  glass  i am much more sorri for it than if you had been in a passion with me  arthur now went to plant his tulip  root  and mauric look at the bed which his companion had been dig  and at all the thing which were come up in his garden   i don  t know how it is  said arthur   but you alway seem as glad to see the thing in my garden come up  and do well  as if they were all your own  i am much happier sinc my father came to live here  and sinc you and i have been allow to work and to play togeth  than i ever was befor  for you must know  befor we came to live here  i had a cousin in the hous with me  who use to plagu me  he was not near so good  natur as you are  he never took pleasur in look at my garden  or at anyth that i did that was well done  and he never gave me a share of anyth that he had  and so i did not like him  how could i  but  i believ that hate peopl make us unhappi  for i know i never was happi when i was quarrel with him  and i am alway happi with you  mauric  you know we never quarrel  it would be well for all the world if they could be convinc  like arthur  that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel  it would be well for all the world if they follow mauric  s maxim of  forgiv and forget  when they receiv  or when they imagin that they receiv  an injuri  arthur  s father  mr  oak  the nurseryman  was apt to take offenc at trifl  and when he thought that ani of his neighbour disoblig him  he was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct  therefor he was often mistaken in his judgment of them  he thought that it show spirit  to rememb and to resent an injuri  and  therefor  though he was not an ill  natur man  he was sometim led  by this mistaken idea of spirit  to do ill  natur thing   a warm friend and a bitter enemi  was one of his maxim  and he had mani more enemi than friend  he was not veri rich  but he was proud  and his favourit proverb was   better live in spite than in piti  when first he settl near mr  grant  the garden  he felt inclin to dislik him  becaus he was told that mr  grant was a scotchman  and he had a prejudic against scotchmen  all of whom he believ to be cun and avarici  becaus he had onc been over  reach by a scotch peddler  grant  s friend manner in some degre conquer this prepossess but still he secret suspect that this civil  as he said   was all show  and that he was not  nor could not  be a scotchman  be such a hearti friend as a true  born englishman  grant had some remark fine raspberri  the fruit was so larg  as to be quit a curios  when it was in season  mani stranger came from the neighbour town  which was a sea  bath place  to look at these raspberri  which obtain the name of brobdingnag raspberri   how came you  pray  neighbour grant  if a man may ask  by these wonder fine raspberri  said mr  oak  one even  to the garden   that  s a secret  repli grant  with an arch smile   oh  in case it  s a secret  i  ve no more to say  for i never meddl with ani man  s secret that he doe not choos to trust me with  but i wish  neighbour grant  you would put down that book  you are alway pore over some book or anoth when a man come to see you  which is not  accord to my notion  be a plain  unlarn englishman bred and born  so civil and neighbour as might be  mr  grant hastili shut his book  but remark  with a shrewd glanc at his son  that it was in that book he found his brobdingnag raspberri   you are pleas to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book  larn as yourself  mr  grant  but i take it  be onli a plain spoken englishman  as i observ afor  that one is to the full as like to find a raspberri in one  s garden as in one  s book  mr  grant  grant  observ that his neighbour spoke rather in a sur tone  did not contradict him  be well vers in the bibl  he knew that  a soft word turneth away wrath  and he answer  in a good humour voic   i hear  neighbour oak  you are like to make a great deal of money of your nurseri this year  here  s to the health of you and your  not forget the seedl larch  which i see are come on fine   thank ye  neighbour  kind  the larch are come on toler well  that  s certain  and here  s to your good health  mr  grant  you and your  not forget your  what dye call  em raspberri  drink  and  after a paus  resum   i  m not apt to be a beggar  neighbour  but if you could give me  here mr  oak was interrupt by the entranc of some stranger  and he did finish make his request  mr  oak was not  as he said of himself  apt to ask favour  and noth but grant  s cordial could have conquer his prejudic  so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a scotchman  he was go to have ask for some of the brobdingnag raspberri  plant  the next day the thought of the raspberri  plant recur to his memori  but be a bash man  he did not like to go himself on purpos to make his request  and he desir his wife  who was just set out to market  to call at grant  s gate  and  if he was at work in his garden  to ask him for a few plant of his raspberri  the answer which oak  s wife brought to him was that mr  grant had not a raspberri  plant in the world to give him  and that if he had ever so mani  he would not give one away  except to his own son  oak flew into a passion when he receiv such a messag  declar it was just such a mean  shabbi trick as might have been expect from a scotchman  call himself a boobi  a dupe  and a blockhead  for ever have trust to the civil speech of a scotchman  swore that he would die in the parish workhous befor he would ever ask anoth favour  be it ever so small  from a scotchman  relat to his wife  for the hundredth time  the way in which he had been taken in by the scotch peddler ten year ago  and conclud by forswear all further intercours with mr  grant  and all belong to him   son arthur  said he  address himself to the boy  who just then came in from work  son arthur  do you hear me  let me never again see you with grant  s son   with mauric  father   with mauric grant  i say  i forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anyth to do with him   oh

boy  simpleton  think you  to play with  but this scotchman  s son  i  ll find out anoth play  fellow for ye  child  if that be all   that  s not all  father  said arthur  tri to stop himself from sob   but the thing is  i shall never have such anoth play  fellow   i shall never have such anoth friend as mauric grant   like father like son  you may think yourself well off to have done with him   done with him  oh  father  and shall i never go again to work in his garden  and may not he come to mine   no  repli oak  sturdili   his father has use me uncivil  and no man shall use me uncivil twice  i say no  wife  sweep up this hearth  boy  don  t take on like a fool  but eat thi bacon and green  and let  s hear no more of mauric grant  arthur promis to obey his father  he onli beg that he might onc more speak to mauric  and tell him that it was by his father  s order he act  this request was grant  but when arthur further beg to know what reason he might give for this separ  his father refus to tell his reason  the two friend took leav of one anoth veri sorrow  mr  grant  when he heard of all this  endeavour to discov what could have offend his neighbour  but all explan was prevent by the obstin silenc of oak  now  the messag which grant realli sent about the brobdingnag raspberri was somewhat differ from that which mr  oak receiv  the messag was  that the raspberri were not mr  grant  s  that therefor he had no right to give them away  that they belong to his son mauric  and that this was not the right time of year for plant them  this messag had been unluckili misunderstood  grant gave his answer to his wife  she to a welsh servant  girl  who did not perfect comprehend her mistress  broad scotch  and she in her turn could not make herself intellig to mrs  oak  who hate the welsh accent  and whose attent  when the servant  girl deliv the messag  was princip engross by the manag of her own hors  the hors  on which mrs  oak rode this day be ill  broken  would not stand still quiet at the gate  and she was extrem impati to receiv her answer  and to ride on to market  oak  when he had onc resolv to dislik his neighbour grant  could not long remain without find out fresh caus of complaint  there was in grant  s garden a plum  tree  which was plant close to the loos stone wall that divid the garden from the nurseri  the soil in which the plum tree was plant happen not to be quit so good as that which was on the opposit side of the wall  and the plum  tree had forc it way through the wall  and gradual had taken possess of the ground which it like best  oak thought the plum  tree  as it belong to mr  grant  had no right to make it appear on his ground  an attorney told him that he might oblig grant to cut it down  but mr  grant refus to cut down his plum  tree at the attorney  s desir  and the attorney persuad oak to go to law about the busi  and the lawsuit went on for some month  the attorney  at the end of this time  came to oak with a demand for money to carri on his suit  assur him that  in a short time  it would be determin in his favour  oak paid his attorney ten golden guinea  remark that it was a great sum for him to pay  and that noth but the love of justic could make him persever in this lawsuit about a bit of ground   which  after all  said he   is not worth twopenc  the plum  tree doe me littl or no damag  but i don  t like to be impos upon by a scotchman  the attorney saw and took advantag of oak  s prejudic against the nativ of scotland  and he persuad him  that to show the spirit of a true  born englishman it was necessari  whatev it might cost him  to persist in this law suit  it was soon after this convers with the attorney that mr  oak walk  with resolut step  toward the plum  tree  say to himself   if it cost me a hundr pound i will not let this cun scotchman get the better of me  arthur interrupt his father  s reveri  by point to a book and some young plant which lay upon the wall   i fanci  father  said he   those thing are for you  for there is a littl note direct to you  in mauric  s handwrit  shall i bring it to you   yes  let me read it  child  sinc i must  it contain these

affect to be anyth but what she realli was  and her friend listen to what she said  though she never repeat the sentiment  or adopt the phrase  which she might easili have copi from the convers of those who were older or more fashion than herself  this word fashion  mrs  theresa tattl knew  had usual a great effect  even at thirteen  but she had not observ that it had much power upon sophi  nor were her remark concern grace and manner much attend to  her mother had taught sophi that it was best to let herself alon  and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquir grimac  which noth but the fashion of the moment can support  and which is alway detect and despis by peopl of real good sens and polit   bless me  said mrs  tattl  to herself   if i had such a tall daughter  and so unform  befor my eye from morn to night  it would certain break my poor heart  thank heaven  i am not a mother  if i were  miss mariann for me  miss mariann had heard so often from mrs  tattl that she

that everybodi was  or ought to be  look at her  and when mrs  theresa saw that mrs  montagu look veri grave upon these occas  she  to repair the ill she had done  would say  after prais mariann  s

truth of which those prudent peopl sure cannot be awar who comfort themselv  and apolog to parent  by say   oh  but i would not say so and so to the child  mrs  theresa had seldom said to frederick montagu   that he had a vast deal of drolleri  and was a most incompar mimic  but she had said so of him in whisper  which magnifi the sound to his imagin  if not to his ear  he was a boy of much

rather cold from a kiss which mrs  tattl was go to give her  for she was somewhat surpris at the familiar with which this ladi talk to her footman  she had not been accustom to these familiar in her father and mother  and she did not like them   well  said mrs  tattl to christoph  who was now return   what is the news   ma  am  the littl fellow with the squeak voic has been tell me the whole

downright rude to tell a ladi you won  t do as she pleas  mr  frederick montagu  i  m sure  is too wellbr a young gentleman to do so unpolit  so ungal a thing  the jargon of polit and gallantri is frequent brought by the silli acquaint of young peopl to confus their simpl moral and clear good sens  a new and unintellig system is present to them  in a languag foreign to their understand  and contradictori to their feel  they hesit between new motiv and old principl  from the fear of be thought ignor  they becom affect  and from the dread of be thought to be children act like fool  but all this they feel onli when they are in the compani of such peopl as mrs  theresa tattl   ma  am  frederick began   i don  t mean to be rude  but i hope you  ll excus me from come to drink tea with you

alway do  one must ask a wit  like a fine singer  so often  well  but now for the favour i was go to ask you  frederick look surpris  for he thought that the favour of his compani was what she meant  but she explain herself farther   as to the old quaker who lodg abov  old ephraim eden  my ladi battersbi and i have so much divers about him  he is the best charact  the oddest creatur  if you were but to see him come into the room with those stiff skirt  or walk with his etern sister bertha  and his everlast broad  brim hat  one know him a mile off  but then his voic and way  and altogeth  if one could get them to the life  they  d be better than anyth on the stage  better even than anyth i  ve seen to  night  and i think you  d make a capit quaker for my ladi battersbi  but then the thing is  one can never get to hear the old quiz talk  now you  who have so much invent and clever  i have no invent myself  but could you not hit upon some way of see him  so that you might get him by heart  i  m sure you  who are so quick  would onli want to see him  and hear him  for half a minut  to be abl to take him off  so as to kill one with laugh  but i have no invent   oh  as to the invent  said frederick   i know an admir way of do the thing  if that is all  but then rememb  i don  t say i will do the thing  for i will not  but i know a way of get up into his room  and see him  without his know me to be there   oh  tell it me  you charm  clever creatur   but  rememb  i do not say i will do it   well  well  let us hear it  and you shall do as you pleas afterward  merci good  exclaim

word  the person who usual help him in his distress was a veri clever  good natur boy  of the name of de grey  who had been mani year under dr  middleton  s care  and who  by his abil and good conduct  did him great credit  the doctor certain was both proud and fond of him  but he was so well belov  or so much esteem by his companion  that nobodi had ever call him by the odious name of favourit  until the arriv of a new scholar of the name of archer  till archer came  the idea of favourit and parti were almost unknown at dr  middleton  s  but he brought all these idea fresh from a great public school  at which he had been educ  at which he had acquir a suffici quantiti of greek and latin  and a superabund quantiti of parti spirit  his aim  the moment he came to a new school  was to get to the head of it  or at least to form the strongest parti  his influenc  for he was a boy of consider abil  was quick felt  though he had a power rival  as he thought proper to call him  in de grey  and  with him  a rival was alway an enemi  de grey  so far from give him ani caus of hatr  treat him with a degre of cordial  which would probabl have had an effect upon archer  s mind  if it had not been for the artific of fisher  it may seem surpris  that a great dunc should be abl to work upon a boy like an archer  who was call a great genius  but when genius is join to a violent temper  instead of be unit to good sens  it is at the merci even of dunc  fisher was mortal offend one morn by de grey  s refus to translat his whole lesson for him  he went over to archer  who  consid him as a partisan desert from the enemi  receiv him with open arm  and translat his whole lesson without express much contempt for his stupid  from this moment fisher forgot all de grey  s former kind  and consid onli how he could in his turn mortifi the person whom he felt to be so much his superior  de grey and archer were now read for a premium  which was to be given in their class  fisher bet on archer  s head  who had not sens enough to despis the bet of a blockhead  on the contrari he suffer him to excit the spirit of rivalship in it utmost furi by collect the bet of all the school  so that this premium now becam a matter of the greatest consequ  and archer  instead of take the mean to secur a judgment in his favour  was listen to the opinion of all his companion  it was a prize which was to be won by his own exert  but he suffer himself to consid it as an affair of chanc  the consequ was  that he trust to chanc  his partisan lost their wager  and he the premium  and his temper   mr  archer  said dr  middleton  after the grand affair was decid   you have done all that genius alon could do  but you  de grey  have done all that genius and industri unit could do   well  cri archer  with affect gaieti  as soon as the doctor had left the room  well  i  m content with my sentenc  genius alon  for me  industri for those who want it  ad he  with a signific look at de grey  fisher applaud this as a veri spirit speech  and  by insinu that dr  middleton  alway gave the premium to de grey  and that  those who had lost their bet might thank themselv for it  for be such simpleton as to bet against the favourit  he rais a murmur high flatter to archer  amongst some of the most credul boy  whilst other loud proclaim their belief in dr  middleton  s imparti  these warm congratul de grey  at this archer grew more and more angri  and when fisher was proceed to speak nonsens for him  push forward into the circl to de grey  cri   i wish  mr  fisher  you would let me fight my own battl   and i wish  said young townsend  who was fonder of divers than of premium  or battl  or of anyth els  i wish  that we were not to have ani battl  after have work like hors  don  t set about to fight like dog  come  said he  tap de grey  s shoulder   let us see your new playhous  do  it  s a holiday  and let us make the most of it  let us have the  school for scandal  do  and i  ll play charl for you  and you  de grey  shall be my littl premium  come  do open this new playhous of your to  night   come then  said de grey  and he ran across the playground to a wast build at the farthest end of it  in which  at the earnest request of the whole communiti  and with the permiss of dr  middleton  he had with much pain and ingenu erect a theatr   the new theatr is go to be open  follow the manag  follow the manag  echo a multitud of voic   follow the manag  echo veri disagre in archer  s ear  but as he could not be left alon  he was also oblig to follow the manag  the moment that the door was unlock  the crowd rush in  the delight and wonder express at the sight was great  and the applaus and thank which were bestow upon the manag were long and loud  archer at least thought them long  for he was impati till his voic could be heard  when at length the acclam had spent themselv  he walk across the stage with a know air  and look round contemptu   and is this your famous playhous  cri he   i wish you had  ani of you  seen the playhous i have been use to  these word made a great and visibl chang in the feel and opinion of the public   who would be a servant of the public  or who would toil for popular applaus  a few word spoken in a decis tone by a new voic oper as a charm  and the playhous was in an instant metamorphos in the eye of the spectat  all gratitud for the past was forgotten  and the expect of someth better justifi to the caprici multitud their disdain of what they had so late pronounc to be excel  everyon now began to criticis  one observ   that the green curtain was full of hole  and would not draw up  anoth attack the scene   scene  they were not like real scene  archer must know best  becaus he was use to these thing  so everybodi crowd to hear someth of the other playhous  they gather round archer to hear the descript of his playhous  and at everi sentenc insult comparison were made  when he had done  his auditor look round  sigh and wish that archer had been their manag  they turn from de grey as from a person who had done them an injuri  some of his friend  for he had friend who were not sway by the popular opinion  felt indign at this ingratitud  and were go to express their feel  but de grey stop them  and beg that he might speak for himself   gentlemen  said he  come forward  as soon as he felt that he had suffici command of himself   my friend  i see you are discont with me and my playhous  i have done my best to pleas you  but if anybodi els can pleas you better  i shall be glad of it  i did

shake hand first  howev  to show that there  s no malic in the case  archer  who was touch by what his rival said  and  stop the hand of his new partisan  fisher  cri   no  fisher  no  no pull down  we can alter it  there is a great deal of ingenu in it  consid  in vain archer would now have recal the public to reason  the time for reason was pass  enthusiasm had taken hold of their mind   down

said he   now it is all over  and now it was all over  there was silenc  the rioter stood still to take breath  and to look at what they had done  there was a blank space befor them  in this moment of silenc there was heard someth like a voic   hush  what strang voic is that  said archer  fisher caught fast hold of his arm  everybodi look round to see where the voic came from  it was dusk  two window  shutter at the farthest end of the build were seen to move slowli inward  de grey  and in the same instant archer  went forward  and  as the shutter open  there appear through the hole the

chancellor of england  no one had half a crown  or no one would sure have kept it in his pocket upon such an occas  for he might have been an archbishop  a king  or what he pleas  fisher  who like all weak peopl was extrem credul  kept his post immov in the front row all the time  his mouth open  and his stupid eye fix upon the gipsi  in whom he felt implicit faith  those who have least confid in their own power  and who have least expect from the success of their own exert  are alway most dispos to trust in fortun  teller and fortun  they hope to win  when they cannot earn  and as they can never be convinc by those who speak sens  it is no wonder they are alway persuad by those who talk nonsens   i have a question to put  said fisher  in a solemn tone   put it  then  said archer   what

and is interest from it be  perhap  the last attempt on record  and also from the circumst of the writer himself have been one of the juvenil leader in the dare adventur   quo rum par magna fuit  ed   the right  it would have taken up too much time to examin what  the right  was  archer was alway sure that  the right  was what his parti chose to do  that is  what he chose to do himself  and such is the influenc of number upon each other  in conquer the feel of shame and in confus the power of reason  that in a few minut  the right  was forgotten  and each said to himself   to be sure  archer is a veri clever boy  and he can  t be mistaken  or   to be sure  townsend think so  and he would not do anyth to get us into a scrape  or   to be sure  everybodi will agre to this but myself  and i can  t stand out alon  to be point at as a greybeard and a slave  everybodi think it is right  and everybodi can  t be wrong  by some of these argument  which pass rapid through the mind without his be conscious of them  each boy decid  and deceiv himself  what none would have done alon  none scrupl to do as a parti  it was determin  then  that there should be a bar out  the arrang of the affair was left to their new manag  to whom they all pledg implicit obedi  obedi  it seem  is necessari  even from rebel to their ringlead  not reason  but implicit obedi  scarc had the assembl adjourn to the ball  alley  when fisher  with an import length of face  came up to the manag  and desir to speak one word to him   my advic to you  archer  is  to do noth in this till we have consult  you know who  about whether it  s right or wrong   you know who  whom do you mean  make hast  and don  t make so mani face  for i  m in a hurri  who is  you know who   the old woman  said fisher  grave   the gipsi   you may consult the old woman  said archer  burst out a  laugh   about what  s right and wrong  if you pleas  but no old woman shall decid for me   no  but you don  t take me  said fisher   you don  t take me  by right and wrong  i mean lucki and unlucki   whatev i do will be lucki  repli archer   my gipsi told you that alreadi   i know  i know  said fisher   and what she said about your friend be lucki  that went a great way with mani  ad he  with a sagaci nod of his head   i can tell you that  more than you think  do you know  said he  lay hold of archer  s button   i  m in the secret  there are nine of us have crook our littl finger upon it  not to stir a step till we get her advic  and she has appoint me to meet her about particular busi of my own at eight  so i  m to consult her and to bring her answer  archer knew too well how to govern fool  to attempt to reason with them  and  instead of laugh ani longer at fisher  s ridicul superstit  he was determin to take advantag of it  he affect to be persuad of the wisdom of the measur  look at his watch  urg him to be exact to a moment  conjur him to rememb exact the word of the oracl  and  abov all thing  to demand the lucki hour and minut when the bar out should begin  with these instruct archer put his watch into the solemn dupe  s hand  and left him to count the second  till the moment of his appoint  whilst he ran off himself to prepar the oracl  at a littl gate which look into a lane  through which he guess that the gipsi must pass  he station himself  saw her  gave her half a crown and her instruct  made his escap  and got back unsuspect to fisher  whom he found in the attitud in which he had left him  watch the motion of the minut hand  proud of his secret commiss  fisher slouch his hat  he knew not whi  over his face  and proceed toward the appoint spot  to keep  as he had been charg by archer  within the letter of the law  he stood behind the forbidden build  and wait some minut  through a gap in the hedg the old woman at length made her appear  muffl up  and look cautious about her   there  s nobodi near us  said fisher  and he began to be a littl afraid   what answer  said he  recollect himself   about my livi   lost  lost  lost  said the gipsi  lift up her hand   never  never  never to be found  but no matter for that now  that is not your errand to  night  no trick with me  speak to me of what is next your heart  fisher  astonish  put his hand upon his heart  told her all that she knew befor  and receiv the answer that archer had dictat   that the archer should be lucki as long as they stuck to their manag  and to one anoth  that the bar out should end in woe  if not begun precis as the clock should strike nine on wednesday night  but if begun in that lucki moment  and all obedi to their lucki leader  all should end well  a thought  a provid thought  now struck fisher  for even he had some foresight where his favourit passion was concern   pray  in our bar out shall we be starv   no  said the gipsi   not if you trust to me for food  and if you give me money enough  silver won  t do for so mani  gold is what must cross my hand   i have no gold  said fisher   and i don  t know what you mean by  so mani  i  m onli talk of number one  you know  i must take care of that first  so  as fisher thought it was possibl that archer  clever as he was  might be disappoint in his suppli  he determin to take secret measur for himself  his aunt barbara  s interdict had shut him out of the confection  s shop  but he flatter himself that he could outwit his aunt  he therefor beg the gipsi to procur him twelv bun by thursday morn  and bring them secret to one of the window of the schoolroom  as fisher did not produc ani money when he made this propos  it was at first absolut reject  but a bribe at length conquer his difficulti  and the bribe which fisher found himself oblig to give  for he had no pocket money left of his own  he be as much restrict in that articl as archer was indulg  the bribe that he found himself oblig to give to quiet the gipsi was half a crown  which archer had intrust to him to buy candl for the theatr   oh  thought he to himself   archer  s so careless about money  he will never think of ask me for the half  crown again  and now he  ll want no candl for the theatr  or  at anyr  it will be some time first  and mayb  aunt

still more vex to have it remark  archer pour forth a volley of incoher exclam and reproach against those who were thus so soon discourag by a trifl  and grope for the tinder  box  he ask if anyth could be easier than to strike a light again  the light appear  but at the moment that it made the tinder  box visibl  anoth shower from abov  aim  and aim exact  at the tinder  box  drench it with water  and render it total unfit for further servic  archer in a furi dash it to the ground  and now for the first time he felt what it was to be the unsuccess head of a parti  he heard in his turn the murmur of a discont  changeabl populac  and recollect all his bar and bolt  and ingeni contriv  he was more provok at their blame him for this one onli oversight than he was griev at the disast

expect that we should have sat up till twelv o  clock  talk  and laugh  and sing   so you may still  what hinder you  said archer   sing  and we  ll join you  and i should be glad those fellow overhead heard us sing  begin  townsend   come now  all ye social power  spread your influenc o  er us  or els   rule  britannia  britannia rule the wave  briton never will be slave  noth can be more melancholi than forc merriment  in vain they roar in chorus  in vain they tri to appear gay  it would not do  the voic die away  and drop off one by one  they had each provid himself with a great  coat to sleep upon  but now  in the dark  there was a peevish scrambl contest for the coat  and half the compani  in veri bad humour  stretch themselv upon the bench for the night  there is great pleasur in bear anyth that has the appear of hardship as long as there is ani glori to be acquir by it  but when peopl feel themselv foil  there is no further pleasur in endur  and if  in their misfortun  there is ani mixtur of the ridicul  the motiv for heroism are immedi destroy  dr  middleton had probabl consid this in the choic he made of his first attack  archer  who had spent the night as a man who had the care of govern upon his shoulder  rose earli in the morn  whilst everybodi els was fast asleep  in the night he had resolv the affair of the trap  door  and a new danger had alarm him  it was possibl that the enemi might descend upon them through the trap  door  the room had been built high to admit a free circul of air  it was twenti feet  so that it was in vain to think of reach to the trap  door  as soon as the daylight appear  archer rose soft  that he might reconnoitr  and devis some method of guard against this new danger  luckili there were round hole in the top of the window  shutter  which admit suffici light for him to work by  the remain of the soak feast  wet candl  and broken glass spread over the tabl in the middl of the room  look rather dismal this morn   a pretti set of fellow i have to manag  said archer  contempl the group of sleeper befor him   it is well they have somebodi to think for them  now if i want  which  thank good  i don  t  but if i did want to call a cabinet council to my assist  whom could i pitch upon  not this stupid snorer  who is dream of gipsi  if he is dream of anyth  continu archer  as he look into fisher  s open mouth   this next chap is quick enough  but  then  he is so fond of have everyth his own way  and this curl pate monkey  who is grin in his sleep  is all tongu and no brain  here are brain  though nobodi would think it  in this lump  said he  look at a fat  roll up  heavi breath sleeper   but what signifi brain to such a lazi dog  i might kick him for my footbal this half hour befor i should get him awak  this lank jaw harlequin besid him is a handi fellow  to be sure  but  then  if he has hand  he has no head  and he  d be afraid of his own shadow too  by this light  he is such a coward  and townsend  whi  he has pun in plenti  but  when there  s ani work to be done  he  s the worst fellow to be near one in the world  he can do noth but laugh at his own pun  this poor littl fellow that we hunt into the corner has more sens than all of them put togeth  but then he is a greybeard  thus specul the chief of a parti upon his sleep friend  and how did it happen that he should be so ambiti to pleas and govern this set  when  for each individu of which it was compos  he felt such suprem contempt  he had form them into a parti  had given them a name  and he was at their head  if these be not good reason  none better can be assign for archer  s conduct   i wish ye could all sleep on  said he   but i must waken ye  though you will be onli in my way  the sound of my hammer must waken them  so i may as well do the thing handsom  and flatter some of them by pretend to ask their advic  accord  he pull two or three to waken them   come  townsend  waken  my boy  here  s some divers for you  up  up   divers  cri townsend   i  m your man  i  m up  up to anyth  so  under the name of divers  archer set townsend to work at four o  clock in the morn  they had nail  a few tool  and sever spar  still left from the wreck of the playhous  these  by archer  s direct  they sharpen at one end  and nail them to the end of sever form  all hand were now call to clear away the supper thing  to erect these form perpendicular under the trap  door  and with the assist of a few brace  a chevaux  de  frise was form  upon which nobodi could ventur to descend  at the farthest end of the room they likewis form a penthous of the tabl  under which they propos to breakfast  secur from the pelt storm  if it should again assail them through the trap  door  they crowd under the penthous as soon as it was readi  and their admir of it ingenu paid the workmen for the job   lord  i shall like to see the garden  s phiz through the trap  door  when he behold the spike under him  cri townsend   now for breakfast   ay  now for breakfast  said archer  look at his watch   past eight o  clock  and my town boy not come  i don  t understand this  archer had expect a constant suppli of provis from two boy who live in the town  who were cousin of his  and who had promis to come everi day  and put food in at a certain hole in the wall  in which a ventil usual turn  this ventil archer had taken down  and had contriv it so that it could be easili remov and replac at pleasur  but  upon examin  it was now perceiv that the hole had been newli stop up by an iron back  which it was imposs to penetr or remov   it never came into my head that anybodi would ever have thought of the ventil but myself  exclaim archer  in great perplex  he listen and wait for his cousin  but no cousin came  and at a late hour the compani were oblig to breakfast upon the scatter fragment of the last night  s feast  that feast had been spread with such imprud profus  that littl now remain to satisfi the hungri guest  archer  who well knew the effect which the apprehens of a scarciti would have upon his associ  did everyth that could be done by a bold counten and reiter assert to persuad them that his cousin would certain come at last and that the suppli were onli delay  the delay  howev  was alarm  fisher alon heard the manag  s calcul and saw the public fear unmov  secret rejoic in his own wisdom  he walk from window to window  slili listen for the gipsi  s signal   there it is  cri he with more joy sparkl in his eye than had ever enlighten them befor   come this way  archer  but don  t tell anybodi  hark  do ye hear those three tap at the window  this is the old woman with twelv bun for me  i  ll give you one whole one for yourself  if you will unbar the window for me   unbar the window  interrupt archer   no  that i won  t  for you or the gipsi either  but i have heard enough to get your bun without that  but stay  there is someth of more consequ than your twelv bun  i must think for ye all  i see  regular  so he summon a council  and propos that everyon should subscrib  and trust the subscript to the gipsi  to purchas a fresh suppli of provis  archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscript  at which sight all the compani clap their hand  and his popular rose to a high pitch with their renew hope of plenti  now  have made a list of their want  they fold the money in the paper  put it into a bag  which archer tie to a long string  and  have broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window  shutter  he let down the bag to the gipsi  she promis to be punctual  and have fill the bag with fisher  s twelv bun  they were drawn up in triumph  and everybodi anticip the pleasur with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner  time  the bun were a littl squeez in be drawn through the hole in the window  shutter  but archer immedi saw out a piec of the shutter  and broke the correspond pane in each of the other window  to prevent suspicion  and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air  what a piti that so much ingenu should have been employ to no purpos  it may have surpris the intellig reader that the gipsi was so punctual to her promis to fisher  but we must recollect that her appar integr was onli cun  she was punctual that she might be employ again  that she might be intrust with the contribut which  she foresaw  must be rais amongst the famish garrison  no sooner had she receiv the money than her end was gain  dinner  time came  it struck three  four  five  six  they listen with hungri ear  but no signal was heard  the morn had been veri long  and archer had in vain tri to dissuad them from devour the remaind of the provis befor they were sure of a fresh suppli  and now those who had been the most confid were the most impati of their disappoint  archer  in the divis of the food  had attempt  by the most scrupul exact  to content the public  and he was both astonish and provok to perceiv that his imparti was impeach  so differ do peopl judg in differ situat  he was the first person to accus his master of injustic  and the least capabl of bear such an imput upon himself from other  he now

promis to obey me  the first thing i ask you to do for your own good  and when  if you had common sens  you must know i can want noth but your good  you rebel against me  traitor  fool  ungrat fool  archer walk up and down  unabl to command his emot  whilst  for the moment  the discont multitud was silenc   here  said he  strike his hand upon the littl boy  s shoulder   here  s the onli one amongst you who has not utter one word of reproach or complaint  and he has had but one bit of bread  a bit that i gave him myself this day  here  said he  snatch the bun  which nobodi had dare to

his own  instead of admir the good sens and steadi of this littl lad  archer suffer townsend to snatch the untast bun out of his hand  he flung it at a hole in the window  but it fell back  the archer scrambl for it  and fisher ate it  archer saw this  and was sensibl that he had not done handsom in suffer it  a few moment ago he had admir his own generos  and though he had felt the injustic of other  he had not accus himself of ani  he turn away from the littl boy  and sit down at one end of the tabl  hid his face in his hand  he continu immov in this postur for some time   lord  said townsend   it was an excel joke   pooh  said fisher   what a fool  to think so much about a bun   never mind  mr  archer  if you are think about me  said the littl boy  tri gentl to pull his hand from his face  archer stoop down  and lift him up upon the tabl  at which sight the partisan set up a general hiss   he has forsaken us  he desert his parti  he want to be a greybeard  after he has got us all into this scrape  he will leav us   i am not go to leav you  cri archer   no one shall ever accus me of desert my parti  i  ll stick by the archer  right or wrong  i tell you  to the last moment  but this littl fellow  take it as you pleas  mutini if you will  and throw me out of the window  call me traitor  coward  greybeard  this littl fellow is worth you all put togeth  and i  ll stand by

littl boy deserv his protect  silenc the crowd  but the storm was onli hush  no sound of merriment was now to be heard  no battledor and shuttlecock   no ball  no marbl  some sat in a corner  whisper their wish that archer would unbar the door  and give up  other  stretch their arm  and gape as they saunter up and down the room  wish for air  or food  or water  fisher and his nine  who had such firm depend upon the gipsi  now gave themselv up to utter despair  it was eight o  clock  grow darker and darker everi minut  and no candl  no light could they have  the prospect of anoth long dark night made them still more discont  townsend  at the head of the yawner  and fisher  at the head of the hungri malcont  gather round archer and the few yet unconqu spirit  demand  how long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon  and whether he expect that they should starv themselv for his sake  the idea of give up was more intoler to archer than all the rest  he saw that the major  his own convinc argument  was against him  he was therefor oblig to condescend to the art of persuas  he flatter some with hope of food from the town boy  some he remind of their promis  other he prais for former prowess  and other he shame by the repetit of their high vaunt in the begin of the busi  it was at length resolv that at all event they would hold out  with this determin they stretch themselv again to sleep  for the second night  in weak and weari obstinaci  archer slept longer and more sound than usual the next morn  and when he awok  he found his hand tie behind him  three or four boy had just got hold of his feet  which they press down  whilst the trembl hand of fisher were fasten the cord round them  with all the forc which rage could inspir  archer struggl and roar to  his archer  his friend  his parti  for help against the traitor  but all kept aloof  townsend  in particular  stood laugh and look on   i beg your pardon  archer  but realli you look so droll  all aliv

archer   laugh on  my boy  friend or foe  it  s all the same to you  i know how to valu your friendship now  you are a mighti good fellow when the sun shine  but let a storm come  and how you slink

and could ye stand by  and see my hand tie behind me like a thief  s  what signifi such a parti  all mute   we want someth to eat  answer the fishermen   what signifi such a parti  inde  and such a

turf which she had rais in the morn  and which  in the pride and gaieti of her heart  she had call her throne  at this instant  mrs  villar came out to enjoy the seren of the even  and  pass by the arbour where cecilia lay  she start  cecilia rose hastili   who is there  said mrs  villar   it is i  madam   and who is i   cecilia   whi  what keep you here  my dear  where are your companion  this

ask you to tell me anyth as your friend  i never punish you as your gover  therefor you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter   no  madam  i am not afraid  but asham  you ask me whi i was not with my companion  whi  madam  becaus they have all left me  and   and what  my dear   and i see that they all dislik me  and yet i don  t know whi they should  for i take as much pain to pleas as ani of them  all my master seem satisfi with me  and you yourself  madam  were pleas this veri morn to give me this bracelet  and i am sure you would not have given it to anyon who did not deserv it   certain not  said mrs  villar   you well deserv it for your applic  for your success applic  the prize was for the most assidu  not for the most amiabl   then  if it had been for the most amiabl  it would not have been for me  mrs  villar  smile  whi  what do you think yourself  cecilia  you are better abl to judg than i am  i can determin whether or no you appli to what i give you to learn  whether you attend to what i desir you to do  and avoid what i desir you not to do  i know that i like you as a pupil  but i cannot know that i should like you as a companion  unless i were your companion  therefor i must judg of what i should do  by see what other do in the same circumst   oh  pray don  t  madam  for then you would not love me either  and yet i think you would love me  for i hope that i am as readi to oblig  and as good  natur as   yes  cecilia  i don  t doubt but that you would be veri good natur to me  but i  m afraid that i should not like you unless you were good  temper  too   but  madam  by good  natur i mean good  temper  it  s all the same thing   no  inde  i understand by them two veri differ thing  you are good  natur  cecilia  for you are desir to oblig and serv your companion  to gain them prais  and save them from blame  to give them pleasur  and reliev them from pain  but leonora is good  temper  for she can bear with their foibl  and acknowledg her own  without disput about the right  she sometim yield to those who are in the wrong  in short  her temper is perfect good  for it can bear and forbear   i wish that mine could  said cecilia  sigh   it may  repli mrs  villar   but it is not wish alon which can improv us in anyth  turn the same exert and persever which have won you the prize to  day to this object  and you will meet with the same success  perhap not on the first  the second  or the third attempt  but depend upon it that you will at last  everi new effort will weaken your bad habit  and strengthen your good one  but you must not expect to succeed all at onc  i repeat it to you  for habit must be counteract by habit  it would be as extravag in us to expect that all our fault could be destroy by one punish  were it ever so sever  as it was in the roman emperor we were read of a few day ago  to wish that all the head of his enemi were upon one neck  that he might cut them off at one blow  here mrs  villar took cecilia by the hand  and they began to walk home  such was the natur of cecilia  s mind  that when ani object was forcibl impress on her imagin  it caus a temporari suspens of her reason faculti  hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirit  and when fear did take possess of her mind  it was attend with total debil  her vaniti was now as much mortifi as in the morn it had been elat  she walk on with mrs  villar in silenc  until they came under the shade of the elm  tree walk  and there  fix her eye upon mrs  villar  she stop short   do you think  madam  said she  with hesit  do you think  madam  that i have a bad heart   a bad heart  my dear  whi  what put that into your head   leonora said that i had  madam  and i felt asham when she said so   but  my dear  how can leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad  howev  in the first place  tell me what you mean by a bad heart   inde i do not know what is meant by it  madam  but it is someth which everybodi hate   and whi do they hate it   becaus they think that it will hurt them  ma  am  i believ  and that those who have bad heart take delight in do mischief  and that they never do anybodi ani good but for their own end   then the best definit  said mrs  villar   which you can give me of a bad heart is  that it is some constant propens to hurt other  and to do wrong for the sake of do wrong   yes  madam  but that is not all either  there is still someth els meant  someth which i cannot express  which  inde  i never distinct understood  but of which  therefor  i was the more afraid   well  then  to begin with what you do understand  tell me  cecilia  do you realli think it possibl to be wick mere for the love of wicked  no human be becom wick all at onc  a man begin by do wrong becaus it is  or becaus he think it  for his interest  if he continu to do so  he must conquer his sens of shame and lose his love of virtu  but how can you  cecilia  who feel such a strong sens of shame  and such an eager desir to improv  imagin that you have a bad heart   inde  madam  i never did  until everybodi told me so  and then i began to be frighten about it  this veri even  madam  when i was in a passion  i threw littl louisa  s strawberri away  which  i am sure  i was veri sorri for afterward  and leonora and everybodi cri out that i had a bad heart  but i am sure i was onli in a passion   veri like  and when you are in a passion  as you call it  cecilia  you see that you are tempt to do harm to other  if they do not feel angri themselv  they do not sympath with you  they do not perceiv the motiv which actuat you  and then they say that you have a bad heart  i daresay  howev  when your passion is over  and when you recollect yourself  you are veri sorri for what you have done and said  are not you   yes  inde  madam  veri sorri   then make that sorri of use to you  cecilia  and fix it steadili in your thought  as you hope to be good and happi  that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon everi occas  anger and it consequ will becom familiar to your mind  and  in the same proport  your sens of shame will be weaken  till what you began with do from sudden impuls you will end with do from habit and choic  then you would  inde  accord to our definit  have a bad heart   oh  madam  i hope  i am sure i never shall   no  inde  cecilia  i do  inde  believ that you never will  on the contrari  i think that you have a veri good disposit  and what is of infinit more consequ to you  an activ desir of improv  show me that you have as much persever as you have candour  and i shall not despair of your becom everyth that i could wish  here cecilia  s counten brighten  and she ran up the step in almost as high spirit as she ran down them in the morn   good  night to you  cecilia  said mrs  villar  as she was cross the hall   good  night to you  madam  said cecilia  and she ran upstair to bed  she could not go to sleep  but she lay awak  reflect upon the event of the preced day  and form resolut for the futur  at the same time that she had resolv  and resolv without effect  she wish to give her mind some more power motiv  ambit she knew to be it most power incent   have i not  said she to herself   alreadi won the prize of applic  and cannot the same applic procur me a much higher prize  mrs  villar said that if the prize had been promis to the most amiabl  it would not have been given to me  perhap it would not yesterday  perhap it might not to  morrow  but that is no reason that i should despair of ever deserv it  in consequ of this reason  cecilia form a design of propos to her companion that they should give a prize  the first of the ensu month  the lst of june  to the most amiabl  mrs  villar applaud the scheme  and her companion adopt it with the greatest alacr   let the prize  said they   be a bracelet of our own hair  and instant their shine scissor were produc  and each contribut a lock of their hair  they form the most beauti gradat of colour  from the palest auburn to the brightest black  who was to have the honour of plait them  was now the question  carolin beg that she might  as she could plait veri neat  she said  cecilia  howev  was equal sure that she could do it much better  and a disput would have inevit ensu  if cecilia  recollect herself just as her colour rose to scarlet  had not yield  yield  with no veri good grace inde  but as well as could be expect for the first time  for it is habit which confer eas  and without eas  even in moral action  there can be no grace  the bracelet was plait in the neatest manner by carolin  finish round the edg with silver twist  and on it was work  in the smallest silver letter  this motto   to the most amiabl  the moment it was complet  everybodi beg to tri it on  it fasten with littl silver clasp  and as it was made larg enough for the eldest girl  it was too larg for the youngest  of this they bitter complain  and unanim entreat that it might be cut to fit them   how foolish  exclaim cecilia   don  t you perceiv that if ani of you win it  you have noth to do but to put the clip a littl further from the edg  but if we get it  we can  t make it larger   veri true  said they   but you need not to have call us foolish  cecilia  it was by such hasti and unguard express as these that cecilia offend  a slight differ in the manner make a veri materi one in the effect  cecilia lost more love by general petul than she could gain by the greatest particular exert  how far she succeed in cure herself of this defect  how far she becam deserv of the bracelet  and to whom the bracelet was given  shall be told in the histori of the first of june   the first of june was now arriv  and all the young competitor were in a state of the most anxious suspens  leonora and cecilia continu to be the foremost candid  their quarrel had never been final adjust  and their differ pretens now retard all thought of a reconcili  cecilia  though she was capabl of acknowledg ani of her fault in public befor all her companion  could not humbl herself in privat to leonora  leonora was her equal  they were her inferior  and submiss is much easier to a vain mind  where it appear to be voluntari  than when it is the necessari tribut to justic or candour  so strong did cecilia feel this truth  that she even delay make ani apolog  or come to ani explan with leonora  until success should onc more give her the palm   if i win the bracelet  to  day  said she to herself   i will solicit the return of leonora  s friendship  it will be more valuabl to me than even the bracelet  and at such a time  and ask in such a manner  she sure cannot refus it to me  anim with this hope of a doubl triumph  cecilia canvass with the most zealous activ  by constant attent and exert she had consider abat the violenc of her temper  and chang the cours of her habit  her power of pleas were now excit  instead of her abil to excel  and  if her talent appear less brilliant  her charact was acknowledg to be more amiabl  so great an influenc upon our manner and conduct have the object of our ambit  cecilia was now  if possibl  more than ever desir of do what was right  but she had not yet acquir suffici fear of do wrong  this was the fundament error of her mind  it aros in a great measur from her earli educ  her mother die when she was veri young  and though her father had suppli her place in the best and kindest manner  he had insens infus into his daughter  s mind a portion of that enterpris  independ spirit which he just deem essenti to the charact of her brother  this brother was some year older than cecilia  but he had alway been the favourit companion of her youth  what her father  s precept inculc  his exampl enforc  and even cecilia  s virtu consequ becam such as were more estim in a man than desir in a femal  all small object and small error she had been taught to disregard as trifl  and her impati disposit was perpetu lead her into more materi fault  yet her candour in confess these  she had been suffer to believ  was suffici repar and aton  leonora  on the contrari  who had been educ by her mother in a manner more suit to her sex  had a charact and virtu more peculiar to a femal  her judgment had been earli cultiv  and her good sens employ in the regul of her conduct  she had been habitu to that restraint  which  as a woman  she was to expect in life  and earli accustom to yield  complianc in her seem natur and grace  yet notwithstand the gentl of her temper  she was in realiti more independ than cecilia  she had more relianc upon her own judgment  and more satisfact in her own approb  the uniform kind of her manner  the consist and equal of her charact  had fix the esteem and passiv love of her companion  by passiv love we mean that speci of affect which make us unwil to offend rather than anxious to oblig  which is more a habit than an emot of the mind  for cecilia her companion felt activ love  for she was activ in show her love to them  activ love aris spontan in the mind  after feel particular instanc of kind  without reflect on the past conduct or general charact  it exceed the merit of it object  and is connect with a feel of generos  rather than with a sens of justic  without determin which speci of love is the most flatter to other  we can easili decid which is the most agreeabl feel to our mind  we give our heart more credit for be generous than for be just  and we feel more self  complac when we give our love voluntarili  than when we yield it as a tribut which we cannot withhold  though cecilia  s companion might not know all this in theori  they prove it in practic  for they love her in a much higher proport to her merit than they love leonora  each of the young judg were to signifi their choic by put a red or a white shell into a vase prepar for the purpos  cecilia  s colour was red  leonora  s white  in the morn noth was to be seen but these shell  noth talk of but the long expect event of the even  cecilia  follow leonora  s exampl  had made it a point of honour not to inquir of ani individu her vote  previous to their final determin  they were both sit togeth in louisa  s room  louisa was recov from the measl  everyon dure her ill had been desir of attend her  but leonora and cecilia were the onli two that were permit to see her  as they alon had had the distemp  they were both assidu in their care of louisa  but leonora  s want of exert to overcom ani disagre feel of sensibl often depriv her of presenc of mind  and prevent her from be so constant use as cecilia  cecilia  on the contrari  often made too much nois and bustl with her offici assist  and was too anxious to invent amus and procur comfort for louisa  without perceiv that ill take away the power of enjoy them  as she was sit at the window in the morn  exert herself to entertain louisa  she heard the voic of an old peddler who often use to come to the hous  downstair they ran immedi  to ask mrs  villar  permiss to bring him into the hall  mrs  villar consent  and away cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companion  then  first return into the hall  she found the peddler just unbuckl his box  and take it

oh  stay one minut  said cecilia  in whose mind there had pass a veri warm conflict dure the peddler  s harangu   louisa would so like this flora  said she  argu with herself   besid  it would be so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugli mandarin  that would be do onli common justic  for i promis it to her  and she expect it  though  when i come to look at this mandarin  it is not even so good as her was  the gild is all rub off  so that i absolut must buy this for her  oh  yes  i will  and she will be so delight  and then everybodi will say it is the prettiest thing they ever

companion  to display her present  in hope that the applaus of other would restor her own self  complac  in vain she saw the flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand  each vy with the other in extol the beauti of the gift and the generos of the giver  cecilia was still displeas with herself  with them  and even with their prais  from louisa  s gratitud  howev  she yet expect much pleasur  and

than have my esteem  my confid  and my friendship for her whole life  yes  for her whole life  for i am sure she will be an amiabl woman  oh  that this bracelet had never been thought of  or that i were certain of her win it  for i am sure that i do not wish to win it from her  i would rather  a thousand time rather  that we were as we use to be than have all the glori in the world  and how

  it is better to be lucki than wise    e meglio esser fortunato che savio  this was a proverb which piedro had frequent heard from his father  and to which he most will trust  becaus it gave him less troubl to fanci himself fortun than to make himself wise   come here  child  said his father to him  when he return home after the preced convers with the garden   how old are you  my boy  twelv year old  is not it   as old as francisco  and older by six month  said piedro   and smarter and more know by six year  said his father   here  take these fish to napl  and let us see how you  ll sell them for me  ventur a small fish  as the proverb say  to catch a great one   i was too late with them at the market yesterday  but nobodi will know but what they are just fresh out of the water  unless you go and tell them   butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio   not i  trust me for that  i  m not such a fool  repli piedro  laugh   i leav that to francisco  do you know  i saw him the other day miss sell a melon for his father by turn the bruis side to the custom  who was just lay down the money for it  and who was a raw servant  boy  moreov  one who would never have guess there were two side to a melon  if he had not  as you say  father  been told of it   off with you to market  you are a droll chap  said his father   and will sell my fish clever  i  ll be bound  as to the rest  let everi man take care of his own grape  you understand me  piedro   perfect  said the boy  who perceiv that his father was indiffer as to his honesti  provid he sold fish at the highest price possibl  he proceed to the market  and he offer his fish with assidu to everi person whom he thought like to buy it  especi to those upon whom he thought he could impos  he posit assert to all who look at his fish  that they were just fresh out of the water  good judg of men and fish knew that he said what was fals  and pass him by with neglect  but it was at last what he call good luck to meet with the veri same young raw servant  boy who would have bought the bruis melon from francisco  he made up to him direct  cri   fish  fine fresh fish  fresh fish   was it caught to  day  said the boy   yes  this morn  not an hour ago  said piedro  with the greatest effronteri  the servant  boy was impos upon  and be a foreign  speak the italian languag but imperfect  and not be expert at reckon the italian money  he was no match for the cun piedro  who cheat him not onli as to the fresh  but as to the price of the commod  piedro receiv near half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done  on his road homeward from napl to the littl villag of resina  where his father live  he overtook francisco  who was lead his father  s ass  the ass was laden with larg pannier  which were fill with the stalk and leav of cauliflow  cabbag  broccoli  lettuc  etc  all the refus of the neapolitan kitchen  which are usual collect by the garden  boy  and carri to the garden round napl  to be mix with other manur   well fill pannier  truli  said piedro  as he overtook francisco and the ass  the pannier were inde not onli fill to the top  but pile up with much skill and care  so that the load met over the anim  s back   it is not a veri heavi load for the ass  though it look so larg  said francisco   the poor fellow  howev  shall have a littl of this water  ad he  lead the ass to a pool by the roadsid   i was not think of the ass  boy  i was not think of ani ass  but of you  when i said   well fill pannier  truli  this is your morn  s work  i presum  and you  ll make anoth journey to napl to  day  on the same errand  i warrant  befor your father think you have done enough   not befor my father think i have done enough  but befor i think so myself  repli francisco   i do enough to satisfi myself and my father  too  said piedro   without slave myself after your fashion  look here  produc the money he had receiv for the fish   all this was had for ask  it is no bad thing  you  ll allow  to know how to ask for money proper   i should be asham to beg  or borrow either  said francisco   neither did i get what you see by beg  or borrow either  said piedro   but by use my wit  not as you did yesterday  when  like a novic  you show the bruis side of your melon  and so spoil your market by your wisdom   wisdom i think it still  said francisco   and your father  ask piedro   and my father  said francisco   mine is of a differ way of think  said piedro   he alway tell me that the buyer has need of a hundr eye  and if one can blind the whole hundr  so much the better  you must know  i got off the fish to  day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market  got it off for fresh just out of the river  got twice as much as the market price for it  and from whom  think you  whi  from the veri boobi that would have bought the bruis melon for a sound one if you would have let him  you  ll allow i  m no fool  francisco  and that i  m in a fair way to grow rich  if i go on as i have begun   stay  said francisco   you forgot that the boobi you took in to  day will not be so easili taken in to  morrow  he will buy no more fish from you  becaus he will be afraid of your cheat him  but he will be readi enough to buy fruit from me  becaus he will know i shall not cheat him  so you  ll have lost a custom  and i gain one   with all my heart  said piedro   one custom doe not make a market  if he buy no more from me  what care i  there are peopl enough to buy fish in napl   and do you mean to serv them all in the same manner  ask francisco   if they will be onli so good as to give me leav  said piedro  laugh  and repeat his father  s proverb   ventur a small fish to catch a larg one   he had learn to think that to cheat in make bargain was witti and clever   see ant   and you have never consid  then  said francisco   that all these peopl will  one after anoth  find you out in time   ay  in time  but it will be some time first  there are a great mani of them  enough to last me all the summer  if i lose a custom a day  said piedro   and next summer  observ francisco   what will you do   next summer is not come yet  there is time enough to think what i shall do befor next summer come  whi  now  suppos the blockhead  after they had been taken in and found it out  all join against me  and would buy none of our fish  what then  are there no trade but that of a fisherman  in napl  are there not a hundr way of make money for a smart lad like me  as my father say  what do you think of turn merchant  and sell sugar  plum and cake to the children in their market  would they be hard to deal with  think you   i think not  said francisco   but i think the children would find out in time if they were cheat  and would like it as littl as the men   i don  t doubt them  then in time i could  you know  chang my trade  sell chip and stick in the wood  market  hand about the lemonad to the fine folk  or twenti other thing  there are trade enough  boy   yes  for the honest dealer  said francisco   but for no other  for in all of them you  ll find  as my father say  that a good charact is the best fortun to set up with  chang your trade ever so often  you  ll be found out for what you are at last   and what am i  pray  said piedro  angrili   the whole truth of the matter is  francisco  that you envi my good luck  and can  t bear to hear this money jingl in my hand  ay  stroke the long ear of your ass  and look as wise as you pleas  it  s better to be lucki than wise  as my father say  good morn to you  when i am found out for what i am  or when the worst come to the worst  i can drive a stupid ass  with his pannier fill with rubbish  as well as you do now  honest francisco   not quit so well  unless you were honest francisco  you would not fill his pannier quit so readili  this was certain  that francisco was so well known for his honesti amongst all the peopl at napl with whom his father was acquaint  that everyon was glad to deal with him  and as he never wrong anyon  all were will to serv him  at least  as much as they could without loss to themselv  so that after the market was over  his pannier were regular fill by the garden and other with whatev he want  his industri was constant  his gain small but certain  and he everi day had more and more reason to trust to his father  s maxim  that honesti is the best polici  the foreign servant lad  to whom francisco had so honest  or  as piedro said  so sillili  shown the bruis side of the melon  was an englishman  he left his nativ countri  of which he was extrem fond  to attend upon his master  to whom he was still more attach  his master was in a declin state of health  and this young lad wait on him a littl more to his mind than his other servant  we must  in consider of his zeal  fidel and inexperi  pardon him for not be a good judg of fish  though he had simplic enough to be easili cheat onc  he had too much sens to be twice made a dupe  the next time he met piedro in the market  he happen to be in compani with sever english gentlemen  s servant  and he point piedro out to them all as an arrant knave  they heard his cri of  fresh fish  fresh fish  fine fresh fish  with incredul smile  and let him pass  but not without some express of contempt  though utter in english  he toler well understood  for the tone of contempt is suffici express in all languag  he lost more by not sell his fish to these peopl than he had gain the day befor by cheat the english boobi  the market was well suppli  and he could not get rid of his cargo   is not this truli provok  said piedro  as he pass by francisco  who was sell fruit for his father   look  my basket is as heavi as when i left home and look at  em yourself  they realli are fine fresh fish to  day and yet  becaus that reveng boobi told how i took him in yesterday  not one of yonder crowd would buy them  and all the time they realli are fresh to  day   so they are  said franscisco   but you said so yesterday  when they were not  and he that was dupe then  is not readi to believ you to  day  how doe he know that you deserv it better   he might have look at the fish  repeat piedro   they are fresh to  day  i am sure he need not have been afraid   ay  said francisco   but as my father said to you onc  the scald dog fear cold water    il cane scottato dell  acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda  here their convers was interrupt by the same english lad  who smile as he came up to francisco  and take up a fine pine  appl  he said  in a mixtur of bad italian and english  i need not look at the other side of this  you will tell me if it is not as good as it look  name your price  i know you have but one  and that an honest one  and as to the rest  i am abl and will to pay for what i buy  that is to say  my master is  which come to the same thing  i wish your fruit could make him well  and it would be worth it weight in gold to me  at least  we must have some of your grape for him   is he not well  inquir francisco   we must  then  pick out the best for him  at the same time singl out a tempt bunch   i hope he will like these  but if you could some day come as far as resina  it is a villag but a few mile out of town  where we have our vineyard  you could there choos for yourself  and pluck them fresh from the vine for your poor master   bless you  my good boy  i should take you for an englishman  by your way of deal  i  ll come to your villag  onli write me down the name  for your italian name slip through my head  i  ll come to the vineyard if it was ten mile off  and all the time we stay in napl  may it not be so long as i fear it will  with my master  s leav  which he never refus me to anyth that  s proper  i  ll deal with you for all our fruit  as sure as my name  s arthur  and with none els  with my good will  i wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesti  inde i do  conclud the englishman  look full at piedro  who took up his unsold basket of fish  look somewhat silli  and gloomili walk off  arthur  the english servant  was as good as his word  he dealt constant with francisco  and prove an excel custom  buy from him dure the whole season as much fruit as his master want  his master  who was an englishman of distinct  was invit to take up his resid  dure his stay in itali  at the count de f  s villa  which was in the environ of napl  an easi walk from resina  francisco had the pleasur of see his father  s vineyard often full of generous visitor  and arthur  who had circul the anecdot of the bruis melon  was  he said   proud to think that some of this was his do  and that an englishman never forgot a good turn  be it from a countryman or foreign   my dear boy  said francisco  s father to him  whilst arthur was in the vineyard help to tend the vine   i am to thank you and your honesti  it seem  for our have our hand so full of busi this season  it is fair you should have a share of our profit   so i have

good luck occur  but he felt  as person usual do  the natur consequ of his own action  he pursu his scheme of impos  as far as he could  upon everi person he dealt with  and the consequ was  that at last nobodi would deal with him   it is easi to outwit one person  but imposs to outwit all the world  said a man  who knew the world at least as well as either piedro or his father   the duke de rochefoucault  on peut etr pul fin qu  un autr  mai pas plus fin que tous les autr  piedro  s father  amongst other  had reason to complain  he saw his own custom fall off from him  and was told  whenev he went into the market  that his son was such a cheat there was no deal with him  one day  when he was return from the market in a veri bad humour  in consequ of these reproach  and of his not

someth in bad italian about the excel of an english trial by juri  which carlo was too much enrag to hear  but to which francisco paid attent  and turn to piedro  he ask him if he was will to be judg

understand the natur and advantag of an english trial by juri  they prefer their own summari mode of proceed  francisco  in whose integr they all had perfect confid  was chosen with unanim shout for the judg  but he declin the offic  and anoth was appoint  he was rais upon a bench  and the guilti but insol look piedro  and the ingenu  modest rosetta stood befor him  she made her complaint in a

compar the notch bit of wood found at the baker  s with a piec from which it was cut  which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal  it was found to fit exact  the judg then found it imposs to restrain the loud indign of all the spectat  the prison was sentenc never more to sell wood in the market  and the moment sentenc was pronounc  piedro was hiss and hoot out of the market  place  thus a third time he depriv himself of the mean of earn his bread  we shall not dwell upon all his petti method of cheat in the trade he next attempt  he hand lemonad about in a part of napl where he was

perceiv that his prosper did not excit much envi  or command ani addit respect from francisco   i would rather  said francisco  when he return to carlo and rosetta  who wait for him under the portico  where he left them  i would rather have such good friend as you  carlo and arthur  and some more i could name  and  besid that  have a clear conscienc  and work honest for my bread  than be as lucki as piedro  do you know he has found a treasur  he say  in his father  s garden  a vase full of gold  he show me one of the gold piec   much good may they do him  i hope he came honest by them  said carlo   but ever sinc the affair of the doubl measur  i suspect doubl  deal alway from him  it is not our affair  howev  let him make himself happi his way  and we our   he that would live in peac and rest  must hear  and see  and say the best    odi  vedi  taci  se vuoi viver in pace  all piedro  s neighbour did not follow this peaceabl maxim  for when he and his father began to circul the stori of the treasur found in the garden  the villag of resina did not give them implicit faith  peopl nod and whisper  and shrug their shoulder  then cross themselv  and declar that they would not  for all the rich of napl  chang place with either piedro or his father  regardless  or pretend to be regardless  of these suspicion  piedro and his father persist in their assert  the fish  net were sold  and everyth in their cottag was dispos of  they left resina  went to live at napl  and  after a few week  the matter began to be almost forgotten in the villag  the old garden  francisco  s father  was one of those who endeavour to think the best  and all that he said upon the subject was  that he would not exchang francisco the honest for piedro the lucki  that one can  t judg of the day till one see the even as well as the morn    la vita il fine  e di loda la sera   comput the morn and even of their day  pope  not to leav our reader longer in suspens  we must inform them that the peasant of resina were right in their suspicion  piedro had never found ani treasur in his father  s garden  but he came by his gold in the follow manner  after he was banish from the littl wood  market for steal rosetta  s basket of wood  after he had cheat the poor woman  who let glass out to hire  out of the valu of the glass which he broke  and  in short  after he had entir lost his credit with all who knew him  he roam about the street of napl  reckless of what becam of him  he found the truth of the proverb   that credit lost is like a venic glass broken  it can  t be mend again  the few shill which he had in his pocket suppli him with food for a few day  at last he was glad to be employ by one of the peasant who came to napl to load their ass with manur out of the street  they often follow veri earli in the morn  or dure the night  time  the trace of carriag that are gone  or that are return from the opera  and piedro was one night at this work  when the hors of a nobleman  s carriag took fright at the sudden blaze of some firework  the carriag was overturn near him  a ladi was taken out of it  and was hurri by her attend into a shop  where she stay till her carriag was set to right  she was too much alarm for the first ten minut after her accid to think of anyth  but after some time  she perceiv that she had lost a valuabl diamond cross  which she had worn that night at the opera  she was uncertain where she had drop it  the shop  the carriag  the street  were search for it in vain  piedro saw it fall as the ladi was lift out of the carriag  seiz upon it  and carri it off  ignor as he was of the full valu of what he had stolen  he knew not how to satisfi himself as to this point  without trust someon with the secret  after some hesit  he determin to appli to a jew  who  as it was whisper  was readi to buy everyth that was offer to him for sale  without make ani troublesom inquiri  it was late  he wait till the street were clear  and then knock soft at the back door of the jew  s hous  the person who open the door for piedro was his own father  piedro start back  but his father had fast hold of him   what bring you here  said the father  in a low voic  a voic which express fear and rage mix   onli to ask my way  my shortest way  stammer piedro   no equivoc  tell me what bring you here at this time of the night  i will know  piedro  who felt himself in his father  s grasp  and who knew that his father would certain search him  to find out what he had brought to sell  thought it most prudent to produc the diamond cross  his father could but just see it lustr by the light of a dim lamp  which hung over their head in the gloomi passag in which they stood   you would have been dupe  if you had gone to sell this to the jew  it is well it has fallen into my hand  how came you by it  piedro answer that he had found it in the street   go your way home  then  said his father   it is safe with me  concern yourself no more about it  piedro was not inclin thus to relinquish his booti  and he now thought proper to vari in his account of the manner in which he found the cross  he now confess that it had drop from the dress of a ladi  whose carriag was overturn as she was come home from the opera  and he conclud by say that  if his father took his prize from him without give him his share of the profit  he would go direct to the shop where the ladi stop whilst her servant were rais the carriag  and that he would give notic of his have found the cross  piedro  s father saw that his smart son  though scarc sixteen year of age  was a match for him in villaini  he promis him that he should have half of whatev the jew would give for the diamond  and piedro insist upon be present at the transact  we do not wish to lay open to our young reader scene of iniqu  it is suffici to say that the jew  who was a man old in all the art of villaini  contriv to cheat both his associ  and obtain the diamond cross for less than half it valu  the matter was manag so that the transact remain undiscov  the ladi who lost the cross  after make fruitless inquiri  gave up the search  and piedro and his father rejoic in the success of their manoeuvr  it is said  that  ill gotten wealth is quick spent   and so it prove in this instanc  both father and son live a riotous life as long as their money last  and it did not last mani month  what his bad educ began  bad compani finish  and piedro  s mind was complet ruin by the associ with whom he becam connect dure what he call his prosper  when his money was at an end  these unprincipl friend began to look cold upon him  and at last plain told him  if you mean to live with us  you must live as we do  they live by robberi   vien presto consumato l  ingiustament acquistato  piedro

of no use to him  for it was alway overpow by the voic of number  and though he had the wish  he never had the power  to do right   poor loveit  i knew he would not refus us  cri his companion  and even tarlton  the moment he shook hand with him  despis him  it is certain that weak of mind is despis both by the good and the bad  the leagu be thus form  tarlton assum all the air of command  explain his scheme  and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old man  s appl  tree  it was the onli one he had the world  we shall not dwell upon their consult  for the amus of contriv such expedit is often the chief thing which induc idl boy to engag in them  there was a small window at the end of the back staircas  through which  between nine and ten o  clock at night  tarlton  accompani by loveit and anoth boy  crept out  it was a moonlight night  and after cross the field  and climb the gate  direct by loveit  who now resolv to go through the affair with spirit  they proceed down the lane with rash yet fear step  at a distanc loveit saw the white wash cottag  and the appl  tree besid it  they quicken their pace  and with some difficulti scrambl through the hedg which fenc the garden  though not without be scratch and torn by the brier  everyth was silent  yet now and then  at everi rustl of the leav  they start  and their heart beat violent  onc  as loveit was climb the appl  tree  he thought he heard a door in the cottag open  and earnest beg his companion to desist and return home  this  howev  he could by no mean persuad them to do  until they had fill their pocket with appl  then  to his great joy  they return  crept in at the window and each retir  as soft as possibl  to his own apart  loveit slept in the room with hardi  whom he had left fast asleep  and whom he now was extrem afraid of awaken  all the appl were empti out of loveit  s pocket  and lodg with tarlton till the morn  for fear the smell should betray the secret to hardi  the room door was apt to creak  but it was open with such precaut  that no nois could be heard  and loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him   ah  said he to himself   how quiet he sleep  i wish i had been sleep too  the reproach of loveit  s conscienc  howev  serv no other purpos but to torment him  he had not suffici strength of mind to be good  the veri next night  in spite of all his fear  and all his penit  and all his resolut  by a littl fresh ridicul and persuas he was induc to accompani the same parti on a similar expedit  we must observ  that the necess for continu their depred becam stronger the third day  for  though at first onli a small parti had been in the secret  by degre it was divulg to the whole school  and it was necessari to secur secreci by share the booti  everyon was astonish that hardi  with all his quick and penetr  had not yet discov their proceed  but loveit could not help suspect that he was not quit so ignor as he appear to be  loveit had strict kept his promis of secreci  but he was by no mean an art boy  and in talk to his friend  conscious that he had someth to conceal  he was perpetu on the point of betray himself  then recollect his engag  he blush  stammer  bungl  and upon hardi  s ask what he meant  would answer with a silli  guilti counten  that he did not know  or abrupt break off  say   oh noth  noth at all  it was in vain that he urg tarlton to permit him to consult his friend  a gloom overspread tarlton  s brow when he began to speak on the subject  and he alway return a peremptori refus  accompani with some such taunt express as this  i wish we had noth to do with such a sneak fellow  he  ll betray us all  i see  befor we have done with him   well  said loveit to himself   so i am abus after all  and call a

for though he was not rich  he had enough to live upon  becaus he had been veri industri in his youth  and he was alway veri readi to part with the littl he had  nor was he a cross old man  if anyth would have made him angri  it would have been the see his favourit tree rob  as he had promis himself the pleasur of give his red appl to his grandchildren on his birthday  howev  he look up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger  and lean upon his staff  he began to consid what he had best do   if i complain to their master  said he to himself   they will certain be flog  and that i should be sorri for  yet they must not be let to go on steal  that would be wors still  for it would sure bring them to the gallow in the end  let me see  oh  ay  that will do  i will borrow farmer kent  s
