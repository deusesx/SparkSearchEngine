 the ball and the cross by g  k  chesterton 1909  i  a discuss somewhat in the air the fli ship of professor lucif sang through the sky like a silver arrow  the bleak white steel of it  gleam in the bleak blue empti of the even  that it was far abov the earth was no express for it  to the two men in it  it seem to be far abov the star  the professor had himself invent the fli machin  and had also invent near everyth in it  everi sort of tool or apparatus had  in consequ  to the full  that fantast and distort look which belong to the miracl of scienc  for the world of scienc and evolut is far more nameless and elus and like a dream than the world of poetri and religion  sinc in the latter imag and idea remain themselv etern  while it is the whole idea of evolut that ident melt into each other as they do in a nightmar  all the tool of professor lucif were the ancient human tool gone mad  grown into unrecogniz shape  forget of their origin  forget of their name  that thing which look like an enorm key with three wheel was realli a patent and veri dead revolv  that object which seem to be creat by the entangl of two corkscrew was realli the key  the thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycl turn upsid  down was the inexpress import instrument to which the corkscrew was the key  all these thing  as i say  the professor had invent  he had invent everyth in the fli ship  with the except  perhap  of himself  this he had been born too late actual to inaugur  but he believ at least  that he had consider improv it  there was  howev  anoth man on board  so to speak  at the time  him  also  by a curious coincid  the professor had not invent  and him he had not even veri great improv  though he had fish him up with a lasso out of his own back garden  in western bulgaria  with the pure object of improv him  he was an exceed holi man  almost entir cover with white hair  you could see noth but his eye  and he seem to talk with them  a monk of immens learn and acut intellect he had made himself happi in a littl stone hut and a littl stoni garden in the balkan  chiefli by write the most crush refut of exposur of certain heresi  the last professor of which had been burnt  general by each other  precis 1  119 year previous  they were realli veri plausibl and thought heresi  and it was realli a credit or even glorious circumst  that the old monk had been intellectu enough to detect their fallaci  the onli misfortun was that nobodi in the modern world was intellectu enough even to understand their argument  the old monk  one of whose name was michael  and the other a name quit imposs to rememb or repeat in our western civil  had  howev  as i have said  made himself quit happi while he was in a mountain hermitag in the societi of wild anim  and now that his luck had lift him abov all the mountain in the societi of a wild physicist  he made himself happi still   i have no intent  my good michael  said professor lucif   of endeavour to convert you by argument  the imbecil of your tradit can be quit final exhibit to anybodi with mere ordinari knowledg of the world  the same kind of knowledg which teach us not to sit in draught or not to encourag friendli in impecuni peopl  it is folli to talk of this or that demonstr the rationalist philosophi  everyth demonstr it  rub shoulder with men of all kind   you will forgiv me  said the monk  meek from under load of white beard   but i fear i do not understand  was it in order that i might rub my shoulder against men of all kind that you put me insid this thing   an entertain retort  in the narrow and deduct manner of the middl age  repli the professor  calm   but even upon your own basi i will illustr my point  we are up in the sky  in your religion and all the religion  as far as i know  and i know everyth  the sky is made the symbol of everyth that is sacr and merci  well  now you are in the sky  you know better  phrase it how you like  twist it how you like  you know that you know better  you know what are a man  s real feel about the heaven  when he find himself alon in the heaven  surround by the heaven  you know the truth  and the truth is this  the heaven are evil  the sky is evil  the star are evil  this mere space  this mere quantiti  terrifi a man more than tiger or the terribl plagu  you know that sinc our scienc has spoken  the bottom has fallen out of the univers  now  heaven is the hopeless thing  more hopeless than ani hell  now  if there be ani comfort for all your miser progeni of morbid ape  it must be in the earth  underneath you  under the root of the grass  in the place where hell was of old  the fieri crypt  the lurid cellar of the underworld  to which you onc condemn the wick  are hideous enough  but at least they are more home than the heaven in which we ride  and the time will come when you will all hide in them  to escap the horror of the star   i hope you will excus my interrupt you  said michael  with a slight cough   but i have alway notic   go on  pray go on  said professor lucif  radiant   i realli like to draw out your simpl idea   well  the fact is  said the other   that much as i admir your rhetor and the rhetor of your school  from a pure verbal point of view  such littl studi of you and your school in human histori as i have been enabl to make has led me to  er  rather singular conclus  which i find great difficulti in express  especi in a foreign languag   come  come  said the professor  encourag   i  ll help you out  how did my view strike you   well  the truth is  i know i don  t express it proper  but somehow it seem to me that you alway convey idea of that kind with most eloqu  when  er  when   oh  get on  cri lucif  boister   well  in point of fact when your fli ship is just go to run into someth  i thought you wouldn  t mind my mention it  but it  s run into someth now  lucif explod with an oath and leapt erect  lean hard upon the handl that act as a helm to the vessel  for the last ten minut they had been shoot downward into great crack and cavern of cloud  now  through a sort of purpl haze  could be seen compar near to them what seem to be the upper part of a huge  dark orb or sphere  island in a sea of cloud  the professor  s eye were blaze like a maniac  s   it is a new world  he cri  with a dread mirth   it is a new planet and it shall bear my name  this star and not that other vulgar one shall be  lucif  sun of the morn  here we will have no charter lunaci  here we will have no god  here man shall be as innoc as the daisi  as innoc and as cruel  here the intellect   there seem  said michael  timid   to be someth stick up in the middl of it   so there is  said the professor  lean over the side of the ship  his spectacl shine with intellectu excit   what can it be  it might of cours be mere a  then a shriek indescrib broke out of him of a sudden  and he flung up his arm like a lost spirit  the monk took the helm in a tire way  he did not seem much astonish for he came from an ignor part of the world in which it is not uncommon for lost spirit to shriek when they see the curious shape which the professor had just seen on the top of the mysteri ball  but he took the helm onli just in time  and by drive it hard to the left he prevent the fli ship from smash into st  paul  s cathedr  a plain of sad  colour cloud lay along the level of the top of the cathedr dome  so that the ball and the cross look like a buoy ride on a leaden sea  as the fli ship swept toward it  this plain of cloud look as dri and definit and rocki as ani grey desert  henc it gave to the mind and bodi a sharp and unearth sensat when the ship cut and sank into the cloud as into ani common mist  a thing without resist  there was  as it were  a dead shock in the fact that there was no shock  it was as if they had cloven into ancient cliff like so much butter  but sensat await them which were much stranger than those of sink through the solid earth  for a moment their eye and nostril were stop with dark and opaqu cloud  then the dark warm into a kind of brown fog  and far  far below them the brown fog fell until it warm into fire  through the dens london atmospher they could see below them the flame london light  light which lay beneath them in squar and oblong of fire  the fog and fire were mix in a passion vapour  you might say that the fog was drown the flame  or you might say that the flame had set the fog on fire  besid the ship and beneath it  for it swung just under the ball  the immeasur dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combin of voiceless cataract  or it was like some cyclopean sea  beast sit abov london and let down it tentacl bewild on everi side  a monstros in that starless heaven  for the cloud that belong to london had close over the head of the voyag seal up the entranc of the upper air  they had broken through a roof and come into a templ of twilight  they were so near to the ball that lucif lean his hand against it  hold the vessel away  as men push a boat off from a bank  abov it the cross alreadi drape in the dark mist of the borderland was shadowi and more aw in shape and size  professor lucif slap his hand twice upon the surfac of the great orb as if he were caress some enorm anim   this is the fellow  he said   this is the one for my money   may i with all respect inquir  ask the old monk   what on earth you are talk about   whi this  cri lucif  smite the ball again   here is the onli symbol  my boy  so fat  so satisfi  not like that scraggi individu  stretch his arm in stark weari  and he point up to the cross  his face dark with a grin   i was tell you just now  michael  that i can prove the best part of the rationalist case and the christian humbug from ani symbol you like to give me  from ani instanc i came across  here is an instanc with a vengeanc  what could possibl express your philosophi and my philosophi better than the shape of that cross and the shape of this ball  this globe is reason  that cross is unreason  it is a four  leg anim  with one leg longer than the other  the globe is inevit  the cross is arbitrari  abov all the globe is at uniti with itself  the cross is primarili and abov all thing at enmiti with itself  the cross is the conflict of two hostil line  of irreconcil direct  that silent thing up there is essenti a collis  a crash  a struggl in stone  pah  that sacr symbol of your has actual given it name to a descript of desper and muddl  when we speak of men at onc ignor of each other and frustrat by each other  we say they are at cross  purpos  away with the thing  the veri shape of it is a contradict in term   what you say is perfect true  said michael  with seren   but we like contradict in term  man is a contradict in term  he is a beast whose superior to other beast consist in have fallen  that cross is  as you say  an etern collis  so am i  that is a struggl in stone  everi form of life is a struggl in flesh  the shape of the cross is irrat  just as the shape of the human anim is irrat  you say the cross is a quadrup with one limb longer than the rest  i say man is a quadrup who onli use two of his leg  the professor frown thought for an instant  and said   of cours everyth is relat  and i would not deni that the element of struggl and self  contradict  repres by that cross  has a necessari place at a certain evolutionari stage  but sure the cross is the lower develop and the sphere the higher  after all it is easi enough to see what is realli wrong with wren  s architectur arrang   and what is that  pray  inquir michael  meek   the cross is on top of the ball  said professor lucif  simpli   that is sure wrong  the ball should be on top of the cross  the cross is a mere barbar prop  the ball is perfect  the cross at it best is but the bitter tree of man  s histori  the ball is the round  the ripe and final fruit  and the fruit should be at the top of the tree  not at the bottom of it   oh  said the monk  a wrinkl come into his forehead   so you think that in a rationalist scheme of symbol the ball should be on top of the cross   it sum up my whole allegori  said the professor   well  that is realli veri interest  resum michael slowli   becaus i think in that case you would see a most singular effect  an effect that has general been achiev by all those abl and power system which ration  or the religion of the ball  has produc to lead or teach mankind  you would see  i think  that thing happen which is alway the ultim embodi and logic outcom of your logic scheme   what are you talk about  ask lucif   what would happen   i mean it would fall down  said the monk  look wist into the void  lucif made an angri movement and open his mouth to speak  but michael  with all his air of deliber  was proceed befor he could bring out a word   i onc knew a man like you  lucif  he said  with a madden monotoni and slow of articul   he took this   there is no man like me  cri lucif  with a violenc that shook the ship   as i was observ  continu michael   this man also took the view that the symbol of christian was a symbol of savageri and all unreason  his histori is rather amus  it is also a perfect allegori of what happen to rationalist like yourself  he began  of cours  by refus to allow a crucifix in his hous  or round his wife  s neck  or even in a pictur  he said  as you say  that it was an arbitrari and fantast shape  that it was a monstros  love becaus it was paradox  then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentr  he would batter the cross by the roadsid  for he live in a roman cathol countri  final in a height of frenzi he climb the steepl of the parish church and tore down the cross  wave it in the air  and utter wild soliloqui up there under the star  then one still summer even as he was wend his way homeward  along a lane  the devil of his mad came upon him with a violenc and transfigur which chang the world  he was stand smoke  for a moment  in the front of an intermin line of pale  when his eye were open  not a light shift  not a leaf stir  but he saw as if by a sudden chang in the eyesight that this pale was an armi of innumer cross link togeth over hill and dale  and he whirl up his heavi stick and went at it as if at an armi  mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up  for he hate the cross and everi pale is a wall of cross  when he return to his hous he was a liter madman  he sat upon a chair and then start up from it for the cross  bar of the carpentri repeat the intoler imag  he flung himself upon a bed onli to rememb that this  too  like all workmanlik thing  was construct on the accurs plan  he broke his furnitur becaus it was made of cross  he burnt his hous becaus it was made of cross  he was found in the river  lucif was look at him with a bitten lip   is that stori realli true  he ask   oh  no  said michael  airili   it is a parabl  it is a parabl of you and all your rationalist  you begin by break up the cross  but you end by break up the habit world  we leav you say that nobodi ought to join the church against his will  when we meet you again you are say that no one has ani will to join it with  we leav you say that there is no such place as eden  we find you say that there is no such place as ireland  you start by hate the irrat and you come to hate everyth  for everyth is irrat and so  lucif leapt upon him with a cri like a wild beast  s   ah  he scream   to everi man his mad  you are mad on the cross  let it save you  and with a herculean energi he forc the monk backward out of the reel car on to the upper part of the stone ball  michael  with as abrupt an agil  caught one of the beam of the cross and save himself from fall  at the same instant lucif drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alon   ha  ha  he yell   what sort of a support do you find it  old fellow   for practic purpos of support  repli michael grim   it is at ani rate a great deal better than the ball  may i ask if you are go to leav me here   yes  yes  i mount  i mount  cri the professor in ungovern excit   altiora peto  my path is upward   how often have you told me  professor  that there is realli no up or down in space  said the monk   i shall mount up as much as you will   inde  said lucif  leer over the side of the fli ship   may i ask what you are go to do  the monk point downward at ludgat hill   i am go  he said   to climb up into a star  those who look at the matter most superfici regard paradox as someth which belong to jest and light journal  paradox of this kind is to be found in the say of the dandi  in the decad comedi   life is much too import to be taken serious  those who look at the matter a littl more deepli or delic see that paradox is a thing which especi belong to all religion  paradox of this kind is to be found in such a say as  the meek shall inherit the earth  but those who see and feel the fundament fact of the matter know that paradox is a thing which belong not to religion onli  but to all vivid and violent practic crise of human live  this kind of paradox may be clear perceiv by anybodi who happen to be hang in mid  space  cling to one arm of the cross of st  paul  s  father michael in spite of his year  and in spite of his ascetic  or becaus of it  for all i know  was a veri healthi and happi old gentleman  and as he swung on a bar abov the sicken empti of air  he realiz  with that sort of dead detach which belong to the brain of those in peril  the deathless and hopeless contradict which is involv in the mere idea of courag  he was a happi and healthi old gentleman and therefor he was quit careless about it  and he felt as everi man feel in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself  his onli possibl strength would be a cool amount to careless  a careless amount almost to a suicid swagger  his one wild chanc of come out safe would be in not too desper desir to be safe  there might be foothold down that aw facad  if onli he could not care whether they were foothold or no  if he were foolhardi he might escap  if he were wise he would stop where he was till he drop from the cross like a stone  and this antinomi kept on repeat itself in his mind  a contradict as larg and stare as the immens contradict of the cross  he rememb have often heard the word   whosoev shall lose his life the same shall save it  he rememb with a sort of strang piti that this had alway been made to mean that whoever lost his physic life should save his spiritu life  now he knew the truth that is known to all fighter  and hunter  and climber of cliff  he knew that even his anim life could onli be save by a consider readi to lose it  some will think it improb that a human soul swing desper in mid  air should think about philosoph inconsist  but such extrem state are danger thing to dogmat about  frequent they produc a certain useless and joyless activ of the mere intellect  thought not onli divorc from hope but even from desir  and if it is imposs to dogmat about such state  it is still more imposs to describ them  to this spasm of saniti and clariti in michael  s mind succeed a spasm of the element terror  the terror of the anim in us which regard the whole univers as it enemi  which  when it is victori  has no piti  and so  when it is defeat has no imagin hope  of that ten minut of terror it is not possibl to speak in human word  but then again in that damnabl dark there began to grow a strang dawn as of grey and pale silver  and of this ultim resign or certainti it is even less possibl to write  it is someth stranger than hell itself  it is perhap the last of the secret of god  at the highest crisi of some incur anguish there will sudden fall upon the man the still of an insan content  it is not hope  for hope is broken and romant and concern with the futur  this is complet and of the present  it is not faith  for faith by it veri natur is fierc  and as it were at onc doubt and defiant  but this is simpli a satisfact  it is not knowledg  for the intellect seem to have no particular part in it  nor is it  as the modern idiot would certain say it is  a mere numb or negat paralysi of the power of grief  it is not negat in the least  it is as posit as good news  in some sens  inde  it is good news  it seem almost as if there were some equal among thing  some balanc in all possibl conting which we are not permit to know lest we should learn indiffer to good and evil  but which is sometim shown to us for an instant as a last aid in our last agoni  michael certain could not have given ani sort of ration account of this vast unmean satisfact which soak through him and fill him to the brim  he felt with a sort of half  wit lucid that the cross was there  and the ball was there  and the dome was there  that he was go to climb down from them  and that he did not mind in the least whether he was kill or not  this mysteri mood last long enough to start him on his dread descent and to forc him to continu it  but six time befor he reach the highest of the outer galleri terror had return on him like a fli storm of dark and thunder  by the time he had reach that place of safeti he almost felt  as in some imposs fit of drunken  that he had two head  one was calm  careless  and effici  the other saw the danger like a dead map  was wise  care  and useless  he had fanci that he would have to let himself vertic down the face of the whole build  when he drop into the upper galleri he still felt as far from the terrestri globe as if he had onli drop from the sun to the moon  he paus a littl  pant in the galleri under the ball  and idl kick his heel  move a few yard along it  and as he did so a thunderbolt struck his soul  a man  a heavi  ordinari man  with a compos indiffer face  and a prosaic sort of uniform  with a row of button  block his way  michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonish man  with the brown moustach and the nickel button  had also come on a fli ship  he mere let his mind float in an endless felic about the man  he thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that galleri with that one man for ever  he thought how he would luxuri in the nameless shade of this man  s soul and then hear with an endless excit about the nameless shade of the soul of all his aunt and uncl  a moment befor he had been die alon  now he was live in the same world with a man  an inexhaust ecstasi  in the galleri below the ball father michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divin and most lovabl of all men  better than all the saint  greater than all the hero  man friday  in the confus colour and music of his new paradis  michael heard onli in a faint and distant fashion some remark that this beauti solid man seem to be make to him  remark about someth or other be after hour and against order  he also seem to be ask how michael  got up  there  this beauti man evid felt as michael did that the earth was a star and was set in heaven  at length michael sate himself with the mere sensual music of the voic of the man in button  he began to listen to what he said  and even to make some attempt at answer a question which appear to have been put sever time and was now put with some excess of emphasi  michael realiz that the imag of god in nickel button was ask him how he had come there  he said that he had come in lucif  s ship  on his give this answer the demeanour of the imag of god underw a remark chang  from address michael gruffli  as if he were a malefactor  he began sudden to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish amiabl as if he were a child  he seem particular anxious to coax him away from the balustrad  he led him by the arm toward a door lead into the build itself  sooth him all the time  he gave what even michael  slight as was his knowledg of the world  felt to be an improb account of the sumptuous pleasur and vari advantag await him downstair  michael follow him  howev  if onli out of polit  down an appar intermin spiral of staircas  at one point a door open  michael step through it  and the unaccount man in button leapt after him and pinion him where he stood  but he onli wish to stand  to stand and stare  he had step as it were into anoth infin  out under the dome of anoth heaven  but this was a dome of heaven made by man  the gold and green and crimson of it sunset were not in the shapeless cloud but in shape of cherubim and seraphim  aw human shape with a passion plumag  it star were not abov but far below  like fallen star still in unbroken constel  the dome itself was full of dark  and far below  lower even than the light  could be seen creep or motionless  great black mass of men  the tongu of a terribl organ seem to shake the veri air in the whole void  and through it there came up to michael the sound of a tongu more terribl  the dread everlast voic of man  call to his god from the begin to the end of the world  michael felt almost as if he were a god  and all the voic were hurl at him   no  the pretti thing aren  t here  said the demi  god in button  caress   the pretti thing are downstair  you come along with me  there  s someth that will surpris you downstair  someth you want veri much to see  evid the man in button did not feel like a god  so michael made no attempt to explain his feel to him  but follow him meek enough down the trail of the serpentin staircas  he had no notion where or at what level he was  he was still full of the cold splendour of space  and of what a french writer has brilliant name the  vertigo of the infinit  when anoth door open  and with a shock indescrib he found himself on the familiar level  in a street full of face  with the hous and even the lamp  post abov his head  he felt sudden happi and sudden indescrib small  he fanci he had been chang into a child again  his eye sought the pavement serious as children  s do  as if it were a thing with which someth satisfactori could be done  he felt the full warmth of that pleasur from which the proud shut themselv out  the pleasur which not onli goe with humili  but which almost is humili  men who have escap death by a hair have it  and men whose love is return by a woman unexpect  and men whose sin are forgiven them  everyth his eye fell on it feast on  not aesthet  but with a plain  jolli appetit as of a boy eat bun  he relish the squar of the hous  he like their clean angl as if he had just cut them with a knife  the lit squar of the shop window excit him as the young are excit by the lit stage of some promis pantomim  he happen to see in one shop which project with a bulg braveri on to the pavement some squar tin of pot meat  and it seem like a hint of a hundr hilari high tea in a hundr street of the world  he was  perhap  the happiest of all the children of men  for in that unendur instant when he hung  half slip  to the ball of st  paul  s  the whole univers had been destroy and re  creat  sudden through all the din of the dark street came a crash of glass  with that mysteri sudden of the cockney mob  a rush was made in the right direct  a dingi offic  next to the shop of the pot meat  the pane of glass was lie in splinter about the pavement  and the polic alreadi had their hand on a veri tall young man  with dark  lank hair and dark  daze eye  with a grey plaid over his shoulder  who had just smash the shop window with a singl blow of his stick   i  d do it again  said the young man  with a furious white face   anybodi would have done it  did you see what it said  i swear i  d do it again  then his eye encount the monkish habit of michael  and he pull off his grey tam  o  shanter with the gestur of a cathol   father  did you see what they said  he cri  trembl   did you see what they dare to say  i didn  t understand it at first  i read it half through befor i broke the window  michael felt he knew not how  the whole peac of the world was pent up pain in his heart  the new and childlik world which he had seen so sudden  men had not seen at all  here they were still at their old bewild  pardon  useless quarrel  with so much to be said on both side  and so littl that need be said at all  a fierc inspir fell on him sudden  he would strike them where they stood with the love of god  they should not move till they saw their own sweet and startl exist  they should not go from that place till they went home embrac like brother and shout like men deliv  from the cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of it fantast merci  and the first three word he spoke in a voic like a silver trumpet  held men as still as stone  perhap if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumin he might have found a religion on ludgat hill  but the heavi hand of his guid fell sudden on his shoulder   this poor fellow is dotti  he said good  humour to the crowd   i found him wander in the cathedr  say he came in a fli ship  is there a constabl to spare to take care of him  there was a constabl to spare  two other constabl attend to the tall young man in grey  a fourth concern himself with the owner of the shop  who show some tendenc to be turbul  they took the tall young man away to a magistr  whither we shall follow him in an ensu chapter  and they took the happiest man in the world away to an asylum  ii  the religion of the stipendiari magistr the editori offic of the atheist had for some year past becom less and less promin interest as a featur of ludgat hill  the paper was unsuit to the atmospher  it show an interest in the bibl unknown in the district  and a knowledg of that volum to which nobodi els on ludgat hill could make ani conspicu claim  it was in vain that the editor of the atheist fill his front window with fierc and final demand as to what noah in the ark did with the neck of the giraff  it was in vain that he ask violent  as for the last time  how the statement  god is spirit  could be reconcil with the statement  the earth is his footstool  it was in vain that he cri with an accus energi that the bishop of london was paid l12  000 a year for pretend to believ that the whale swallow jonah  it was in vain that he hung in conspicu place the most thrill scientif calcul about the width of the throat of a whale  was it noth to them all they that pass by  did his sudden and splendid and truli sincer indign never stir ani of the peopl pour down ludgat hill  never  the littl man who edit the atheist would rush from his shop on starlit even and shake his fist at st  paul  s in the passion of his holi war upon the holi place  he might have spare his emot  the cross at the top of st  paul  s and the atheist shop at the foot of it were alik remot from the world  the shop and the cross were equal uplift and alon in the empti heaven  to the littl man who edit the atheist  a fieri littl scotchman  with fieri  red hair and beard  go by the name of turnbul  all this declin in public import seem not so much sad or even mad  but mere bewild and unaccount  he had said the worst thing that could be said  and it seem accept and ignor like the ordinari second best of the politician  everi day his blasphemi look more glare  and everi day the dust lay thicker upon them  it made him feel as if he were move in a world of idiot  he seem among a race of men who smile when told of their own death  or look vacant at the day of judgement  year after year went by  and year after year the death of god in a shop in ludgat becam a less and less import occurr  all the forward men of his age discourag turnbul  the socialist said he was curs priest when he should be curs capitalist  the artist said that the soul was most spiritu  not when freed from religion  but when freed from moral  year after year went by  and at least a man came by who treat mr  turnbul  s secularist shop with a real respect and serious  he was a young man in a grey plaid  and he smash the window  he was a young man  born in the bay of arisaig  opposit rum and the isl of skye  his high  hawklik featur and snaki black hair bore the mark of that unknown histor thing which is crude call celtic  but which is probabl far older than the celt  whoever they were  he was in name and stock a highland of the macdonald  but his famili took  as was common in such case  the name of a subordin sept as a surnam  and for all the purpos which could be answer in london  he call himself evan macian  he had been brought up in some loneli and seclus as a strict roman cathol  in the midst of that littl wedg of roman cathol which is driven into the western highland  and he had found his way as far as fleet street  seek some half  promis employ  without have proper realiz that there were in the world ani peopl who were not roman cathol  he had uncov himself for a few moment befor the statu of queen ann  in front of st  paul  s cathedr  under the firm impress that it was a figur of the virgin mari  he was somewhat surpris at the lack of defer shown to the figur by the peopl bustl by  he did not understand that their one essenti histor principl  the one law truli graven on their heart  was the great and comfort statement that queen ann is dead  this faith was as fundament as his faith  that our ladi was aliv  ani person he had talk to sinc he had touch the fring of our fashion or civil had been by a coincid  sympathet or hypocrit  or if they had spoken some establish blasphemi  he had been unabl to understand them mere owe to the preoccupi satisfact of his mind  on that fantast fring of the gaelic land where he walk as a boy  the cliff were as fantast as the cloud  heaven seem to humbl itself and come closer to the earth  the common path of his littl villag began to climb quit sudden and seem resolv to go to heaven  the sky seem to fall down toward the hill  the hill took hold upon the sky  in the sumptuous sunset of gold and purpl and peacock green cloudlet and islet were the same  evan live like a man walk on a borderland  the borderland between this world and anoth  like so mani men and nation who grow up with natur and the common thing  he understood the supernatur befor he understood the natur  he had look at dim angel stand knee  deep in the grass befor he had look at the grass  he knew that our ladi  s robe were blue befor he knew the wild rose round her feet were red  the deeper his memori plung into the dark hous of childhood the nearer and nearer he came to the thing that cannot be name  all through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divin debri  the broken remaind of his first vision  the sky and mountain were the splendid off  scour of anoth place  the star were lost jewel of the queen  our ladi had gone and left the star by accid  his privat tradit was equal wild and unworld  his great  grandfath had been cut down at culloden  certain in his last instant that god would restor the king  his grandfath  then a boy of ten  had taken the terribl claymor from the hand of the dead and hung it up in his hous  burnish it and sharpen it for sixti year  to be readi for the next rebellion  his father  the youngest son and the last left aliv  had refus to attend on queen victoria in scotland  and evan himself had been of one piec with his progenitor  and was not dead with them  but aliv in the twentieth centuri  he was not in the least the pathet jacobit of whom we read  left behind by a final advanc of all thing  he was  in his own fanci  a conspir  fierc and up to date  in the long  dark afternoon of the highland winter  he plot and fume in the dark  he drew plan of the captur of london on the desol sand of arisaig  when he came up to captur london  it was not with an armi of white cockad  but with a stick and a satchel  london overaw him a littl  not becaus he thought it grand or even terribl  but becaus it bewild him  it was not the golden citi or even hell  it was limbo  he had one shock of sentiment  when he turn that wonder corner of fleet street and saw st  paul  s sit in the sky   ah  he said  after a long paus   that sort of thing was built under the stuart  then with a sour grin he ask himself what was the correspond monument of the brunswick and the protest constitut  after some warn  he select a sky  sign of some pill  half an hour afterward his emot left him with an empti mind on the same spot  and it was in a mood of mere idl investig that he happen to come to a standstil opposit the offic of the atheist  he did not see the word  atheist  or if he did  it is quit possibl that he did not know the mean of the word  even as it was  the document would not have shock even the innoc highland  but for the troublesom and quit unforeseen fact that the innoc highland read it stolid to the end  a thing unknown among the most enthusiast subscrib to the paper  and calcul in ani case to creat a new situat  with a smart journalist instinct characterist of all his school  the editor of the atheist had put first in his paper and most promin in his window an articl call  the mesopotamian mytholog and it effect on syriac folk lore  mr  evan macian began to read this quit idl  as he would have read a public statement begin with a young girl die in brighton and end with bile bean  he receiv the veri consider amount of inform accumul by the author with that tire clear of the mind which children have on heavi summer afternoon  that tire clear which lead them to go on ask question long after they have lost interest in the subject and are as bore as their nurs  the street were full of peopl and empti of adventur  he might as well know about the god of mesopotamia as not  so he flatten his long  lean face against the dim bleak pane of the window and read all there was to read about mesopotamian god  he read how the mesopotamian had a god name sho  sometim pronounc ji  and that he was describ as be veri power  a strike similar to some express about jahveh  who is also describ as have power  evan had never heard of jahveh in his life  and imagin him to be some other mesopotamian idol  read on with a dull curios  he learnt that the name sho  under it third form of psa  occur in an earli legend which describ how the deiti  after the manner of jupit on so mani occas  seduc a virgin and begat a hero  this hero  whose name is not essenti to our exist  was  it was said  the chief hero and saviour of the mesopotamian ethic scheme  then follow a paragraph give other exampl of such hero and saviour be born of some proflig intercours between god and mortal  then follow a paragraph  but evan did not understand it  he read it again and then again  then he did understand it  the glass fell in ring fragment on to the pavement  and evan sprang over the barrier into the shop  brandish his stick   what is this  cri littl mr  turnbul  start up with hair aflam   how dare you break my window   becaus it was the quickest

were more respect  howev  to the young man who had smash the window  than to the miscreant who had had his window smash  there was an air of refin mysteri about evan macian  which did not exist in the irat littl shopkeep  an air of refin mysteri which appeal to the policemen  for policemen  like most other english type  are at onc snob and poet  macian might possibl be a gentleman  they felt  the editor manifest was not  and the editor  s fine ration republican appeal to his respect for law  and his ardour to be tri by his fellow citizen  seem to the polic quit as much gibberish as evan  s mystic could have done  the polic were not use to hear principl  even the principl of their own exist  the polic magistr  befor whom they were hurri and tri  was a mr  cumberland vane  a cheer  middl

 i will fight him as our father fought  he shall choos how  sword or pistol  hors or foot  but if he refus  i will write his cowardic on everi wall in the world  if he had said of my mother what he

this  may he fight for anyth  i would fight for my friend  but if i lost my friend  i should still be there  i would fight for my countri  but if i lost my countri  i should still exist  but if what that devil dream were true  i should not be  i should burst like a bubbl and be gone  i could not live in that imbecil univers  shall i not fight for my own exist  the magistr recov his voic and his presenc of mind  the first part of the speech  the bombast and brutal practic challeng  stun him with surpris  but the rest of evan  s remark  branch off as they did into theoret phrase  gave his vagu and veri english mind  full of memori of the hedg and compromis in english public speak  an indistinct sensat of relief  as if the man  though mad  were not so danger as he had thought  he went into a sort of weari laughter   for heaven  s sake  man  he said   don  t talk so much  let other peopl have a chanc  laughter  i trust all that you said about ask mr  turnbul to fight  may be regard as

this absurd matter myself  this rather wild gentleman promis that he will not attack me with ani ordinari assault  and if he doe  you may be sure the polic shall hear of it  but he say he will not  he say he will challeng me to a duel  and i cannot say anyth stronger about his mental state than to say that i think that it is high probabl that he will   laughter  but it take two to make a duel  your

serious  i should love to see him send you challeng and to see you smile  well  well  evan went out of the court of justic free  but strang shaken  like a sick man  ani punish of suppress he would have felt as natur  but the sudden junctur between the laughter of his judg and the laughter of the man he had wrong  made him feel sudden small  or at least  defeat  it was realli true that the whole

if you want to  now  fight if you dare   i swear to you  then  said macian  after a paus   i swear to you that noth shall come between us  i swear to you that noth shall be in my heart or in my head till our sword clash togeth  i swear it by the god you have deni  by the bless ladi you have blasphem  i swear it by the seven sword in her heart  i swear it by the holi island where my father are  by the honour of my mother  by the secret of my peopl  and by the chalic of the blood of god  the atheist drew up his head   and i  he said   give my word  iii  some old curios the even sky  a dome of solid gold  unflak even by a singl sunset cloud  steep the meanest sight of london in a strang and mellow light  it made a littl greasi street of st  martin  s lane look as if it were pave with gold  it made the pawnbrok  s half  way down it shine as if it were realli that mountain of pieti that the french poetic instinct has name it  it made the mean pseudo  french bookshop  next but one to it  a shop pack with dreari indec  show for a moment a kind of parisian colour  and the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreari indec  show with quit a blaze of old world beauti  for it was  by accid  a shop not unbeauti in itself  the front window had a glimmer of bronz and blue steel  lit  as by a few star  by the spark of what were alleg to be jewel  for it was in brief  a shop of bric  a  brac and old curios  a row of half  burnish seventeenth  centuri sword ran like an ornat rail along the front of the window  behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour  and higher up hung the most extraordinari look south sea tool or utensil  whether design for kill enemi or mere for cook them  no mere white man could possibl conjectur  but the romanc of the eye  which realli on this rich even  clung about the shop  had it main sourc in the accid of two door stand open  the front door that open on the street and a back door that open on an odd green squar of garden  that the sun turn to a squar of gold  there is noth more beauti than thus to look as it were through the archway of a hous  as if the open sky were an interior chamber  and the sun a secret lamp of the place  i have suggest that the sunset light made everyth love  to say that it made the keeper of the curios shop love would be a tribut to it perhap too extrem  it would easili have made him beauti if he had been mere squalid  if he had been a jew of the fagin type  but he was a jew of anoth and much less admir type  a jew with a veri well  sound name  for though there are no hard test for separ the tare and the wheat of ani peopl  one rude but effici guid is that the nice jew is call mose solomon  and the nasti jew is call thornton perci  the keeper of the curios shop was of the thornton perci branch of the chosen peopl  he belong to those lost ten tribe whose industri object is to lose themselv  he was a man still young  but alreadi corpul  with sleek dark hair  heavi handsom cloth  and a full  fat  perman smile  which look at the first glanc kind  and at the second coward  the name over his shop was henri gordon  but two scotchmen who were in his shop that even could come upon no trace of a scotch accent  these two scotchmen in this shop were care purchas  but free  hand payer  one of them who seem to be the princip and the author  whom  inde  mr  henri gordon fanci he had seen somewher befor  was a small  sturdi fellow  with fine grey eye  a squar red tie and a squar red beard  that he carri aggress forward as if he defi anyon to pull it  the other kept so much in the background in comparison that he look almost ghost in his grey cloak or plaid  a tall  sallow  silent young man  the two scotchmen were interest in seventeenth  centuri sword  they were fastidi about them  they had a whole armouri of these weapon brought out and roll clatter about the counter  until they found two of precis the same length  presum they desir the exact symmetri for some decor trophi  even then they felt the point  pois the sword for balanc and bent them in a circl to see that they sprang straight again  which  for decor purpos  seem carri realism rather far   these will do  said the strang person with the red beard   and perhap i had better pay for them at onc  and as you are the challeng  mr  macian  perhap you had better explain the situat  the tall scotchman in grey took a step forward and spoke in a voic quit clear and bold  and yet somehow lifeless  like a man go through an ancient formal   the fact is  mr  gordon  we have to place our honour in your hand  word have pass between mr  turnbul and myself on a grave and invalu matter  which can onli be aton for by fight  unfortun  as the polic are in some sens pursu us  we are hurri  and must fight now and without second  but if you will be so kind as to take us into your littl garden and see far play  we shall feel how  the shopman recov himself from a stun surpris and burst out   gentlemen  are you drunk  a duel  a duel in my garden  go home  gentlemen  go home  whi  what did you quarrel about   we quarrel  said evan  in the same dead voic   about religion  the fat shopkeep roll about in his

and fierc  point toward the pawnbrok  s next door   don  t you own that shop   whi  er  yes  said gordon   and don  t you own that shop  repeat the secularist  point backward to the pornograph booksel   what if i do   whi  then  cri turnbul  with grate contempt   i will leav the religion of human confid in your hand  but i am sorri i troubl you about such a thing as honour  look here  my man  i do believ in human  i do believ in liberti  my father die for it under the sword of the yeomanri  i am go to die for it  if need be  under that sword on your counter  but if there is one sight that make me doubt it it is your foul fat face  it is hard to believ you were not meant to be rule like a dog or kill like a cockroach  don  t tri your slave  s philosophi on me  we are go to fight  and we are go to fight in your garden  with your sword  be still  rais your voic abov a whisper  and i run you through the bodi  turnbul put the bright point of the sword against the gay waistcoat of the dealer  who stood choke with rage and fear  and an astonish so crush as to be greater than either   macian  said turnbul  fall almost into the familiar tone of a busi partner   macian  tie up this fellow and put a gag in his mouth  be still  i say  or i kill you where you stand  the man was too frighten to scream  but he struggl wild  while evan macian  whose long  lean hand were unusu power  tighten some old curtain cord round him  strap a rope gag in his mouth and roll him on his back on the floor   there  s noth veri strong here  said evan  look about him   i  m afraid he  ll work through that gag in half an hour or so   yes  said turnbul   but one of us will be kill by that time   well  let  s hope so  said the highland  glanc doubt at the squirm thing on the floor   and now  said turnbul  twirl his fieri moustach and finger his sword   let us go into the garden  what an exquisit summer even  macian said noth  but lift his sword from the counter went out into the sun  the brilliant light ran along the blade  fill the channel of them with white fire  the combat stuck their sword in the turf and took off their hat  coat  waistcoat  and boot  evan said a short latin prayer to himself  dure which turnbul made someth of a parad of light a cigarett which he flung away the instant after  when he saw macian appar stand readi  yet macian was not exact readi  he stood stare like a man stricken with a tranc   what are you stare at  ask turnbul   do you see the bobbi   i see jerusalem  said evan   all cover with the shield and standard of the saracen   jerusalem  said turnbul  laugh   well  we  ve taken the onli inhabit into captiv  and he pick up his sword and made it whistl like a boy  s wand   i beg your pardon  said macian  dryli   let us begin  macian made a militari salut with his weapon  which turnbul copi or parodi with an impati contempt  and in the still of the garden the sword came togeth with a clear sound like a bell  the instant the blade touch  each felt them tingl to their veri point with a person vital  as if they were two nake nerv of steel  evan had worn throughout an air of apathi  which might have been the stale apathi of one who want noth  but it was inde the more dread apathi of one who want someth and will care for noth els  and this was seen sudden  for the instant evan engag he disengag and lung with an infern violenc  his oppon with a desper promptitud parri and ripost  the parri onli just succeed  the ripost fail  someth big and unbear seem to have broken final out of evan in that first murder lung  leav him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet  he fell to again  fierc still  but now with a fierc caution  the next moment turnbul lung  macian seem to catch the point and throw it away from him  and was thrust back like a thunderbolt  when a sound paralys him  anoth sound besid their ring weapon  turnbul  perhap from an equal astonish  perhap from chivalri  stop also and forebor to send his sword through his expos enemi   what  s that  ask evan  hoars  a heavi scrape sound  as of a trunk be drag along a litter floor  came from the dark shop behind them   the old jew has broken one of his string  and he  s crawl about  said turnbul   be quick  we must finish befor he get his gag out   yes  yes  quick  on guard  cri the highland  the blade cross again with the same sound like song  and the men went to work again with the same white and watch face  evan  in his impati  went back a littl to his wild  he made windmil  as the french duellist say  and though he was probabl a shade the better fencer of the two  he found the other  s point pass his face twice so close as almost to graze his cheek  the second time he realiz the actual possibl of defeat and pull himself togeth under a shock of the saniti of anger  he narrow  and  so to speak  tighten his oper  he fenc  as the swordsman  s boast goe  in a wed ring  he turn turnbul  s thrust with a madden and almost mechan click  like that of a machin  whenev turnbul  s sword sought to go over that other mere white streak it seem to be caught in a complex network of steel  he turn one thrust  turn anoth  turn anoth  then sudden he went forward at the lung with his whole live weight  turnbul leap back  but evan lung and lung and lung again like a devilish piston rod or batter ram  and high abov all the sound of the struggl there broke into the silent even a bellow human voic  nasal  raucous  at the highest pitch of pain   help  help  polic  murder  murder  the gag was broken  and the tongu of terror was loos   keep on  gasp turnbul   one may be kill befor they come  the voic of the scream shopkeep was loud enough to drown not onli the nois of the sword but all other nois around it  but even through it rend din there seem to be some other stir or scurri  and evan  in the veri act of thrust at turnbul  saw someth in his eye that made him drop his sword  the atheist  with his grey eye at their widest and wildest  was stare straight over his shoulder at the littl archway of shop that open on the street beyond  and he saw the archway block and blacken with strang figur   we must bolt  macian  he said abrupt   and there isn  t a damn second to lose either  do as i do  with a bound he was besid the littl cluster of his cloth and boot that lay on the lawn  he snatch them up  without wait to put ani of them on  and tuck his sword under his other arm  went wild at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it  three second after he had alight in his sock on the other side  macian alight besid him  also in his sock and also carri cloth and sword in a desper bundl  they were in a by  street  veri lean and lone itself  but so close to a crowd thoroughfar that they could see the vagu mass of vehicl go by  and could even see an individu hansom cab pass the corner at the instant  turnbul put his finger to his mouth like a gutter  snipe and whistl twice  even as he did so he could hear the loud voic of the neighbour and the polic come down the garden  the hansom swung sharpli and came tear down the littl lane at his call  when the cabman saw his fare  howev  two wild  hair men in their shirt and sock with nake sword under their arm  he not unnatur brought his readi to a rigid stop and stare suspici   you talk to him a minut  whisper turnbul  and step back into the shadow of the wall   we want you  said macian to the cabman  with a superb scotch drawl of indiffer and assur   to drive us to st  pancra station  verra quick   veri sorri  sir  said the cabman   but i  d like to know it was all right  might i arst where you come from  sir  a second after he spoke macian heard a heavi voic on the other side of the wall  say   i suppos i  d better get over and look for them  give me a back   cabbi  said macian  again assum the most deliber and linger lowland scotch inton   if ye  re realli verra anxious to ken whar a  come fra  i  ll tell ye as a verra great secret  a  come from scotland  and a  m gaein  to st  pancra station  open the door  cabbi  the cabman stare  but laugh  the heavi voic behind the wall said   now then  a better back this time  mr  price  and from the shadow of the wall turnbul crept out  he had struggl wild into his coat  leav his waistcoat on the pavement  and he was with a fierc pale face climb up the cab behind the cabman  macian had no glimmer notion of what he was up to  but an instinct of disciplin  inherit from a hundr men of war  made him stick to his own part and trust the other man  s   open the door  cabbi  he repeat  with someth of the obstin solemn of a drunkard   open the door  did ye no hear me say st  pancra station  the top of a policeman  s helmet appear abov the garden wall  the cabman did not see it  but he was still suspici and began   veri sorri  sir  but  and with that the catlik turnbul tore him out of his seat and hurl him into the street below  where he lay sudden stun   give me his hat  said turnbul in a silver voic  that the other obey like a bugl   and get insid with the sword  and just as the red and rage face of a policeman appear abov the wall  turnbul struck the hors with a terribl cut of the whip and the two went whirl away like a boomerang  they had spun through seven street and three or four squar befor anyth further happen  then  in the neighbourhood of maida vale  the driver open the trap and talk through it in a manner not wholli common in convers through that apertur   mr  macian  he said short and civilli   mr  turnbul  repli his motionless fare   under circumst such as those in which we were both recent place there was no time for anyth but veri abrupt action  i trust therefor that you have no caus to complain of me if i have defer until this moment a consult with you on our present posit or futur action  our present posit  mr  macian  i imagin that i am under no special necess of describ  we have broken the law and we are flee from it offic  our futur action is a thing about which i myself entertain suffici strong view  but i have no right to assum or to anticip your  though i may have form a decid concept of your charact and a decid notion of what they will probabl be  still  by everi principl of intellectu justic  i am bound to ask you now and serious whether you wish to continu our interrupt relat  macian leant his white and rather weari face back upon the cushion in order to speak up through the open door   mr  turnbul  he said   i have noth to add to what i have said befor  it is strong born in upon me that you and i  the sole occup of this runaway cab  are at this moment the two most import peopl in london  possibl in europ  i have been look at all the street as we went past  i have been look at all the shop as we went past  i have been look at all the church as we went past  at first  i felt a littl daze with the vast of it all  i could not understand what it all meant  but now i know exact what it all mean  it mean us  this whole civil is onli a dream  you and i are the realiti   religi symbol  said mr  turnbul  through the trap   doe not  as you are probabl awar  appeal ordinarili to thinker of the school to which i belong  but in symbol as you use it in this instanc  i must  i think  conced a certain truth  we must fight this thing out somewher  becaus  as you truli say  we have found each other  s realiti  we must kill each other  or convert each other  i use to think all christian were hypocrit  and i felt quit mild toward them realli  but i know you are sincer  and my soul is mad against you  in the same way you use  i suppos  to think that all atheist thought atheism would leav them free for immor  and yet in your heart you toler them entir  now you know that i am an honest man  and you are mad against me  as i am against you  yes  that  s it  you can  t be angri with bad men  but a good man in the wrong  whi one thirst for his blood  yes  you open for me a vista of thought   don  t run into anyth  said evan  immov   there  s someth in that view of your  too  said turnbul  and shut down the trap  they sped on through shine street that shot by them like arrow  mr  turnbul had evid a great deal of unus practic talent which was unrol itself in this ridicul adventur  they had got away with such stun promptitud that the polic chase had in all probabl not even proper begun  but in case it had  the amateur cabman chose his dizzi cours through london with a strang dexter  he did not do what would have first occur to ani ordinari outsid desir to destroy his track  he did not cut into by  way or twist his way through mean street  his amateur common sens told him that it was precis the poor street  the side street  that would be like to rememb and report the pass of a hansom cab  like the pass of a royal process  he kept chiefli to the great road  so full of hansom that a wilder pair than they might easili have pass in the press  in one of the quieter street evan put on his boot  toward the top of albani street the singular cabman again open the trap   mr  macian  he said   i understand that we have now definit settl that in the convent languag honour is not satisfi  our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupt condit  that  i believ  is understood   perfect  repli the other with his bootlac in his teeth   under those condit  continu turnbul  his voic come through the hole with a slight note of trepid veri unusu with him   i have a suggest to make  if that can be call a suggest  which has probabl occur to you as readili as to me  until the actual event come off we are practic in the posit if not of comrad  at least of busi partner  until the event come off  therefor i should suggest that quarrel would be inconveni and rather inartist  while the ordinari exchang of polit between man and man would be not onli eleg but uncommon practic   you are perfect right  answer macian  with his melancholi voic   in say that all this has occur to me  all duellist should behav like gentlemen to each other  but we  by the queer of our posit  are someth much more than either duellist or gentlemen  we are  in the oddest and most exact sens of the term  brother  in arm   mr  macian  repli turnbul  calm   no more need be said  and he close the trap onc more  they had reach finchley road befor he open it again  then he said   mr  macian  may i offer you a cigar  it will be a touch of realism   thank you  answer evan   you are veri kind  and he began to smoke in the cab  iv  a discuss at dawn the duellist had from their own point of view escap or conquer the chief power of the modern world  they had satisfi the magistr  they had tie the tradesman neck and heel  and they had left the polic behind  as far as their own feel went they had melt into a monstrous sea  they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansom that fill london street  but they had forgotten someth  they had forgotten journal  they had forgotten that there exist in the modern world  perhap for the first time in histori  a class of peopl whose interest is not that thing should happen well or happen bad  should happen success or happen unsuccess  should happen to the advantag of this parti or the advantag of that part  but whose interest simpli is that thing should happen  it is the one great weak of journal as a pictur of our modern exist  that it must be a pictur made up entir of except  we announc on flare poster that a man has fallen off a scaffold  we do not announc on flare poster that a man has not fallen off a scaffold  yet this latter fact is fundament more excit  as indic that that move tower of terror and mysteri  a man  is still abroad upon the earth  that the man has not fallen off a scaffold is realli more sensat  and it is also some thousand time more common  but journal cannot reason be expect thus to insist upon the perman miracl  busi editor cannot be expect to put on their poster   mr  wilkinson still safe  or  mr  jone  of worth  not dead yet  they cannot announc the happi of mankind at all  they cannot describ all the fork that are not stolen  or all the marriag that are not judici dissolv  henc the complet pictur they give of life is of necess fallaci  they can onli repres what is unusu  howev democrat they may be  they are onli concern with the minor  the incid of the religi fanat who broke a window on ludgat hill was alon enough to set them up in good copi for the night  but when the same man was brought befor a magistr and defi his enemi to mortal combat in the open court  then the column would hard hold the excruci inform  and the headlin were so larg that there was hard room for ani of the text  the daili telegraph head a column   a duel on divin  and there was a correspond afterward which last for month  about whether polic magistr ought to mention religion  the daili mail in it dull  sensibl way  head the event   want to fight for the virgin  mr  jame dougla  in the star  presum on his knowledg of philosoph and theolog term  describ the christian  s outbreak under the titl of  dualist and duellist  the daili news insert a colourless account of the matter  but was pursu and eaten up for some week  with letter from out minist  head  murder and mariolatri  but the journalist temperatur was steadili and consist heat by all these influenc  the journalist had tast blood  prospect  and were in the mood for more  everyth in the matter prepar them for further outburst of moral indign  and when a gasp report rush in in the last hour of the even with the announc that the two hero of the polic court had liter been found fight in a london back garden  with a shopkeep bound and gag in the front of the hous  the editor and sub  editor were stricken still as men are by great beatitud  the next morn  five or six of the great london daili burst out simultan into great blossom of eloqu leader  write  toward the end all the leader tend to be the same  but they all began differ  the daili telegraph  for instanc began   there will be littl differ among our reader or among all truli english and law  abid men touch the  etc  etc  the daili mail said   peopl must learn  in the modern world  to keep their theolog differ to themselv  the fraca  etc  etc  the daili news start   noth could be more inim to the caus of true religion than  etc  etc  the times began with someth about celtic disturb of the equilibrium of empir  and the daili express distinguish itself splendid by omit altogeth so controversi a matter and substitut a leader about golosh  and the morn after that  the editor and the newspap were in such a state  that  as the phrase is  there was no hold them  whatev secret and elvish thing it is that brood over editor and sudden turn their brain  that thing had seiz on the stori of the broken glass and the duel in the garden  it becam monstrous and omnipres  as do in our time the unimport do of the sect of the agapemonit  or as did at an earlier time the dreari dishonesti of the rhodesian financi  question were ask about it  and even answer  in the hous of common  the govern was solemn denounc in the paper for not have done someth  nobodi knew what  to prevent the window be broken  an enorm subscript was start to reimburs mr  gordon  the man who had been gag in the shop  mr  macian  one of the combat  becam for some mysteri reason  singl and huge popular as a comic figur in the comic paper and on the stage of the music hall  he was alway repres  in defianc of fact  with red whisker  and a veri red nose  and in full highland costum  and a song  consist of an unimagin number of vers  in which his name was rhyme with flat iron  the british lion  sli  un  dandelion  spion  with kop in the next line  was sung to crowd hous everi night  the paper develop a devour thirst for the captur of the fugit  and when they had not been caught for forti  eight hour  they sudden turn the whole matter into a detect mysteri  letter under the head   where are they  pour in to everi paper  with everi conceiv kind of explan  run them to earth in the monument  the twopenni tube  ep forest  westminst abbey  roll up in carpet at shoolbr  lock up in safe in chanceri lane  yes  the paper were veri interest  and mr  turnbul unrol a whole bundl of them for the amus of mr  macian as they sat on a high common to the north of london  in the come of the white dawn  the dark in the east had been broken with a bar of grey  the bar of grey was split with a sword of silver and morn lift itself labori over london  from the spot where turnbul and macian were sit on one of the barren steep behind hampstead  they could see the whole of london shape itself vagu and larg in the grey and grow light  until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet  the splendid monstros that it is  it bewild squar and parallelogram were compact and perfect as a chines puzzl  an enorm hieroglyph which man must deciph or die  there fell upon both of them  but upon turnbul more than the other  becaus he know more what the scene signifi  that quit indescrib sens as of a sublim and passion and heart  move futil  which is never evok by desert or dead men or men neglect and barbar  which can onli be invok by the sight of the enorm genius of man appli to anyth other than the best  turnbul  the old idealist democrat  had so often revil the democraci and revil them just for their supin  their snobbish  their evil rever for idl thing  he was right enough  for our democraci has onli one great fault  it is not democrat  and after denounc so just averag modern men for so mani year as sophist and as slave  he look down from an empti slope in hampstead and saw what god they are  their achiev seem all the more heroic and divin  becaus it seem doubt whether it was worth do at all  there seem to be someth greater than mere accuraci in make such a mistak as london  and what was to be the end of it all  what was to be the ultim transform of this common and incred london man  this workman on a tram in battersea  his clerk on an omnibus in cheapsid  turnbul  as he stare drearili  murmur to himself the word of the old atheist and revolutionari swinburn who had intox his youth   and still we ask if god or man can loosen thee lazarus  bid thee rise up republican  and save thyself and all of us  but no discipl  s tongu can say if thou can  st take our sin away  turnbul shiver slight as if behind the earth morn he felt the even of the world  the sunset of so mani hope  those word were from  song befor sunris  but turnbul  s song at their best were song after sunris  and sunris had been no such great thing after all  turnbul shiver again in the sharp morn air  macian was also gaze with his face toward the citi  but there was that about his blind and mystic stare that told one  so to speak  that his eye were turn inward  when turnbul said someth to him about london  they seem to move as at a summon and come out like two household come out into their doorway   yes  he said  with a sort of stupid   it  s a veri big place  there was a somewhat unmean silenc  and then macian said again   it  s a veri big place  when i first came into it i was frighten of it  frighten exact as one would be frighten at the sight of a man forti feet high  i am use to big thing where i come from  big mountain that seem to fill god  s infin  and the big sea that goe to the end of the world  but then these thing are all shapeless and confus thing  not made in ani familiar form  but to see the plain  squar  human thing as larg as that  hous so larg and street so larg  and the town itself so larg  was like have screw some devil  s magnifi glass into one  s eye  it was like see a porridg bowl as big as a hous  or a mous  trap made to catch eleph   like the land of the brobdingnagian  said turnbul  smile   oh  where is that  said macian  turnbul said bitter   in a book  and the silenc fell sudden between them again  they were sit in a sort of litter on the hillsid  all the thing they had hurri collect  in various place  for their flight  were strewn indiscrimin round them  the two sword with which they had late sought each other  s live were flung down on the grass at random  like two idl walk  stick  some provis they had bought last night  at a low public hous  in case of undefin conting  were toss about like the materi of an ordinari picnic  here a basket of chocol  and there a bottl of wine  and to add to the disord final  there were strewn on top of everyth  the most disord of modern thing  newspap  and more newspap  and yet again newspap  the minist of the modern anarchi  turnbul pick up one of them drearili  and took out a pipe   there  s a lot about us  he said   do you mind if i light up   whi should i mind  ask macian  turnbul eye with a certain studious interest  the man who did not understand ani of the verbal courtesi  he lit his pipe and blew great cloud out of it   yes  he resum   the matter on which you and i are engag is at this moment realli the best copi in england  i am a journalist  and i know  for the first time  perhap  for mani generat  the english are realli more angri about a wrong thing done in england than they are about a wrong thing done in franc   it is not a wrong thing  said macian  turnbul laugh   you seem unabl to understand the ordinari use of the human languag  if i did not suspect that you were a genius  i should certain know you were a blockhead  i fanci we had better be get along and collect our baggag  and he jump up and began shove the luggag into his pocket  or strap it on to his back  as he thrust a tin of can meat  anyhow  into his burst side pocket  he said casual   i onli meant that you and i are the most promin peopl in the english paper   well  what did you expect  ask macian  open his great grave blue eye   the paper are full of us  said turnbul  stoop to pick up one of the sword  macian stoop and pick up the other   yes  he said  in his simpl way   i have read what they have to say  but they don  t seem to understand the point   the point of what  ask turnbul   the point of the sword  said macian  violent  and plant the steel point in the soil like a man plant a tree   that is a point  said turnbul  grim   that we will discuss later  come along  turnbul tie the last tin of biscuit desper to himself with string  and then spoke  like a diver girt for plung  short and sharp   now  mr  macian  you must listen to me  you must listen to me  not mere becaus i know the countri  which you might learn by look at a map  but becaus i know the peopl of the countri  whom you could not know by live here thirti year  that infern citi down there is awak  and it is awak against us  all those endless row of window and window are all eye stare at us  all those forest of chimney are finger point at us  as we stand here on the hillsid  this thing has caught on  for the next six mortal month they will think of noth but us  as for six mortal month they thought of noth but the dreyfus case  oh  i know it  s funni  they let starv children  who don  t want to die  drop by the score without look round  but becaus two gentlemen  from privat feel of delicaci  do want to die  they will mobil the armi and navi to prevent them  for half a year or more  you and i  mr  macian  will be an obstacl to everi reform in the british empir  we shall prevent the chines be sent out of the transvaal and the block be stop in the strand  we shall be the convers substitut when anyon recommend home rule  or complain of sky sign  therefor  do not imagin  in your innoc  that we have onli to melt away among those english hill as a highland cateran might into your god  forsaken highland mountain  we must be etern on our guard  we must live the hunt life of two distinguish crimin  we must expect to be recogn as much as if we were napoleon escap from elba  we must be prepar for our descript be sent to everi tini villag  and for our face be recogn by everi ambiti policeman  we must often sleep under the star as if we were in africa  last and most import we must not dream of effect our  our final settlement  which will be a thing as famous as the phoenix park murder  unless we have made real and precis arrang for our isol  i will not say our safeti  we must not  in short  fight until we have thrown them off our scent  if onli for a moment  for  take my word for it  mr  macian  if the british public onc catch us up  the british public will prevent the duel  if it is onli by lock us both up in asylum for the rest of our day  macian was look at the horizon with a rather misti look   i am not at all surpris  he said   at the world be against us  it make me feel i was right to   yes  said turnbul   to smash your window  said macian   i have woken up the world   veri well  then  said turnbul  stolid   let us look at a few final fact  beyond that hill there is compar clear countri  fortun  i know the part well  and if you will follow me exact  and  when necessari  on your stomach  we may be abl to get ten mile out of london  liter without meet anyon at all  which will be the best possibl begin  at ani rate  we have provis for at least two day and two night  three day if we do it care  we may be abl to get fifti or sixti mile away without even walk into an inn door  i have the biscuit and the tin meat  and the milk  you have the chocol  i think  and the brandi   yes  said macian  like a soldier take order   veri well  then  come on  march  we turn under that third bush and so down into the valley  and he set off ahead at a swing walk  then he stop sudden  for he realiz that the other was not follow  evan macian was lean on his sword with a lower face  like a man sudden smitten still with doubt   what on earth is the matter  ask turnbul  stare in some anger  evan made no repli   what the deuc is the matter with you  demand the leader  again  his face slowli grow as red as his beard  then he said  sudden  and in a more human voic   are you in pain  macian   yes  repli the highland  without lift his face   take some brandi  cri turnbul  walk forward hurri toward him   you  ve got it   it  s not in the bodi  said macian  in his dull  strang way   the pain has come into my mind  a veri dread thing has just come into my thought   what the devil are you talk about  ask turnbul  macian broke out with a queer and live voic   we must fight now  turnbul  we must fight now  a fright thing has come upon me  and i know it must be now and here  i must kill you here  he cri  with a sort of tear rage imposs to describ   here  here  upon this bless grass   whi  you idiot  began turnbul   the hour has come  the black hour god meant for it  quick  it will soon be gone  quick  and he flung the scabbard from him furious  and stood with the sunlight sparkl along his sword   you confound fool  repeat turnbul   put that thing up again  you ass  peopl will come out of that hous at the first clash of the steel   one of us will be dead befor they come  said the other  hoars   for this is the hour god meant   well  i never thought much of god  said the editor of the atheist  lose all patienc   and i think less now  never mind what god meant  kind enlighten my pagan dark as to what the devil you mean   the hour will soon be gone  in a moment it will be gone  said the madman   it is now  now  now that i must nail your blasphem bodi to the earth  now  now that i must aveng our ladi on her vile slander  now or never  for the dread thought is in my mind   and what thought  ask turnbul  with frantic composur   occupi what you call your mind   i must kill you now  said the fanat   becaus   well  becaus  said turnbul  patient   becaus i have begun to like you  turnbul  s face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight  a chang so instantan that it left no trace behind it  and his featur seem still carv into a cold stare  but when he spoke again he seem like a man who was placid pretend to misunderstand someth that he understood perfect well   your affect express itself in an abrupt form  he began  but macian broke the brittl and frivol speech to piec with a violent voic   do not troubl to talk like that  he said   you know what i mean as well as i know it  come on and fight  i say  perhap you are feel just as i do  turnbul  s face flinch again in the fierc sunlight  but his attitud kept it contemptu eas   your celtic mind realli goe too fast for me  he said   let me be permit in my heavi lowland way to understand this new develop  my dear mr  macian  what do you realli mean  macian still kept the shine sword  point toward the other  s breast   you know what i mean  you mean the same yourself  we must fight now or els   or els  repeat turnbul  stare at him with an almost blind graviti   or els we may not want to fight at all  answer evan  and the end of his speech was like a despair cri  turnbul took out his own sword sudden as if to engag  then plant it point downward for a moment  he said   befor we begin  may i ask you a question  macian bow patient  but with burn eye   you said  just now  continu turnbul  present   that if we did not fight now  we might not want to fight at all  how would you feel about the matter if we came not to want to fight at all   i should feel  answer the other   just as i should feel if you had drawn your sword  and i had run away from it  i should feel that becaus i had been weak  justic had not been done   justic  answer turnbul  with a thought smile   but we are talk about your feel  and what do you mean by justic  apart from your feel  macian made a gestur of weari recognit   oh  nomin  he said  with a sort of sigh   we had all that out in the twelfth centuri   i wish we could have it out now  repli the other  firm   do you realli mean that if you came to think me right  you would be certain wrong   if i had a blow on the back of my head  i might come to think you a green eleph  answer macian   but have i not the right to say now  that if i thought that i should think wrong   then you are quit certain that it would be wrong to like me  ask turnbul  with a slight smile   no  said evan  thought   i do not say that  it may not be the devil  it may be some part of god i am not meant to know  but i had a work to do  and it is make the work difficult   and i suppos  said the atheist  quit gentl   that you and i know all about which part of god we ought to know  macian burst out like a man driven back and explain everyth   the church is not a thing like the athenaeum club  he cri   if the athenaeum club lost all it member  the athenaeum club would dissolv and ceas to exist  but when we belong to the church we belong to someth which is outsid all of us  which is outsid everyth you talk about  outsid the cardin and the pope  they belong to it  but it doe not belong to them  if we all fell dead sudden  the church would still somehow exist in god  confound it all  don  t you see that i am more sure of it exist than i am of my own exist  and yet you ask me to trust my tempera  my own tempera  which can be turn upsid down by two bottl of claret or an attack of the jaundic  you ask me to trust that when it soften toward you and not to trust the thing which i believ to be outsid myself and more real than the blood in my bodi   stop a moment  said turnbul  in the same easi tone   even in the veri act of say that you believ this or that  you impli that there is a part of yourself that you trust even if there are mani part which you mistrust  if it is onli you that like me  sure  also  it is onli you that believ in the cathol church  evan remain in an unmov and grave attitud   there is a part of me which is divin  he answer   a part that can be trust  but there are also affect which are entir anim and idl   and you are quit certain  i suppos  continu turnbul   that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholli anim and idl  for the first time macian start as if he had not expect the thing that was said to him  at last he said   whatev in earth or heaven it is that has join us two togeth  it seem to be someth which make it imposs to lie  no  i do not think that the movement in me toward you was  was that surfac sort of thing  it may have been someth deeper  someth strang  i cannot understand the thing at all  but understand this and understand it thorough  if i love you my love might be divin  no  it is not some trifl that we are fight about  it is not some superstit or some symbol  when you wrote those word about our ladi  you were in that act a wick man do a wick thing  if i hate you it is becaus you have hate good  and if i like you  it is becaus you are good  turnbul  s face wore an indecipher express   well  shall we fight now  he said   yes  said macian  with a sudden contract of his black brow   yes  it must be now  the bright sword cross  and the first touch of them  travel down blade and arm  told each combat that the heart of the other was awaken  it was not in that way that the sword rang togeth when they had rush on each other in the littl garden behind the dealer  s shop  there was a paus  and then macian made a movement as if to thrust  and almost at the same moment turnbul sudden and calm drop his sword  evan stare round in an unusu bewilder  and then realiz that a larg man in pale cloth and a panama hat was stroll seren toward them  v  the peacemak when the combat  with cross sword  becam sudden conscious of a third parti  they each made the same movement  it was as quick as the snap of a pistol  and they alter it instantan and recov their origin pose  but they had both made it  they had both seen it  and they both knew what it was  it was not a movement of anger at be interrupt  say or think what they would  it was a movement of relief  a forc within them  and yet quit beyond them  seem slowli and pitiless wash away the adam of their oath  as mistaken lover might watch the inevit sunset of first love  these men watch the sunset of their first hatr  their heart were grow weaker and weaker against each other  when their weapon rang and ripost in the littl london garden  they could have been veri certain that if a third parti had interrupt them someth at least would have happen  they would have kill each other or they would have kill him  but now noth could undo or deni that flash of fact  that for a second they had been glad to be interrupt  some new and strang thing was rise higher and higher in their heart like a high sea at night  it was someth that seem all the more merciless  becaus it might turn out an enorm merci  was there  perhap  some such fatal in friendship as all lover talk about in love  did god make men love each other against their will   i  m sure you  ll excus my speak to you  said the stranger  in a voic at onc eager and deprec  the voic was too polit for good manner  it was incongru with the eccentr spectacl of the duellist which ought to have startl a sane and free man  it was also incongru with the full and healthi  though rather loos physiqu of the man who spoke  at the first glanc he look a fine anim  with curl gold beard and hair  and blue eye  unusu bright  it was onli at the second glanc that the mind felt a sudden and perhap unmean irrit at the way in which the gold beard retreat backward into the waistcoat  and the way in which the fine shape nose went forward as if smell it way  and it was onli  perhap  at the hundredth glanc that the bright blue eye  which normal befor and after the instant seem brilliant with intellig  seem as it were to be brilliant with idioci  he was a heavi  healthi  look man  who look all the larger becaus of the loos  light colour cloth that he wore  and that had in their extrem light and loos  almost a touch of the tropic  but a closer examin of his attir would have shown that even in the tropic it would have been uniqu  but it was all woven accord to some hygien textur which no human be had ever heard of befor  and which was absolut necessari even for a day  s health  he wore a huge broad  brim hat  equal hygien  veri much at the back of his head  and his voic come out of so heavi and hearti a type of man was  as i have said  startl shrill and deferenti   i  m sure you  ll excus my speak to you  he said   now  i wonder if you are in some littl difficulti which  after all  we could settl veri comfort togeth  now  you don  t mind my say this  do you  the face of both combat remain somewhat solid under this appeal  but the stranger  probabl take their silenc for a gather shame  continu with a kind of gaieti   so you are the young men i have read about in the paper  well  of cours  when one is young  one is rather romant  do you know what i alway say to young peopl  a blank silenc follow this gay inquiri  then turnbul said in a colourless voic   as i was forti  seven last birthday  i probabl came into the world too soon for the experi   veri good  veri good  said the friend person   dri scotch humour  dri scotch humour  well now  i understand that you two peopl want to fight a duel  i suppos you aren  t much up in the modern world  we  ve quit outgrown duell  you know  in fact  tolstoy tell us that we shall soon outgrow war  which he say is simpli a duel between nation  a duel between nation  but there is no doubt about our have outgrown duell  wait for some effect upon his wooden auditor  the stranger stood beam for a moment and then resum   now  they tell me in the newspap that you are realli want to fight about someth connect with roman catholic  now  do you know what i alway say to roman cathol   no  said turnbul  heavili   do they  it seem to be a characterist of the hearti  hygien gentleman that he alway forgot the speech he had made the moment befor  without enlarg further on the fix form of his appeal to the church of rome  he laugh cordial at turnbul  s answer  then his wander blue eye caught the sunlight on the sword  and he assum a good  humour graviti   but you know this is a serious matter  he said  eye turnbul and macian  as if they had just been keep the tabl in a roar with their frivol   i am sure that if i appeal to your higher natur  your higher natur  everi man has a higher natur and a lower natur  now  let us put the matter veri plain  and without ani romant nonsens about honour or anyth of that sort  is not bloodsh a great sin   no  said macian  speak for the first time   well  realli  realli  said the peacemak   murder is a sin  said the immov highland   there is no sin of bloodsh   well  we won  t quarrel about a word  said the other  pleasant   whi on earth not  said macian  with a sudden asper   whi shouldn  t we quarrel about a word  what is the good of word if they aren  t import enough to quarrel over  whi do we choos one word more than anoth if there isn  t ani differ between them  if you call a woman a chimpanze instead of an angel  wouldn  t there be a quarrel about a word  if you  re not go to argu about word  what are you go to argu about  are you go to convey your mean to me by move your ear  the church and the heresi alway use to fight about word  becaus they are the onli thing worth fight about  i say that murder is a sin  and bloodsh is not  and that there is as much differ between those word as there is between the word  yes  and the word  no  or rather more differ  for  yes  and  no  at least  belong to the same categori  murder is a spiritu incid  bloodsh is a physic incid  a surgeon commit bloodsh   ah  you  re a casuist  said the larg man  wag his head   now  do you know what i alway say to casuist  macian made a violent gestur  and turnbul broke into open laughter  the peacemak did not seem to be in the least annoy  but continu in unab enjoy   well  well  he said   let us get back to the point  now tolstoy has shown that forc is no remedi  so you see the posit in which i am place  i am do my best to stop what i  m sure you won  t mind my call this realli useless violenc  this realli quit wrong violenc of your  but it  s against my principl to call in the polic against you  becaus the polic are still on a lower moral plane  so to speak  becaus  in short  the polic undoubt sometim employ forc  tolstoy has shown that violenc mere breed violenc in the person toward whom it is use  wherea love  on the other hand  breed love  so you see how i am place  i am reduc to use love in order to stop you  i am oblig to use love  he gave to the word an indescrib sound of someth hard and heavi  as if he were say  boot  turnbul sudden grip his sword and said  short   i see how you are place quit well  sir  you will not call the polic  mr  macian  shall we engag  macian pluck his sword out of the grass   i must and will stop this shock crime  cri the tolstoian  crimson in the face   it is against all modern idea  it is against the principl of love  how you  sir  who pretend to be a christian  macian turn upon him with a white face and bitter lip   sir  he said   talk about the principl of love as much as you like  you seem to me colder than a lump of stone  but i am will to believ that you may at some time have love a cat  or a dog  or a child  when you were a babi  i suppos you love your mother  talk about love  then  till the world is sick of the word  but don  t you talk about christian  don  t you dare to say one word  white or black  about it  christian is  as far as you are concern  a horribl mysteri  keep clear of it  keep silent upon it  as you would upon an abomin  it is a thing that has made men slay and tortur each other  and you will never know whi  it is a thing that has made men do evil that good might come  and you will never understand the evil  let alon the good  christian is a thing that could onli make you vomit  till you are other than you are  i would not justifi it to you even if i could  hate it  in god  s name  as turnbul doe  who is a man  it is a monstrous thing  for which men die  and if you will stand here and talk about love for anoth ten minut it is veri probabl that you will see a man die for it  and he fell on guard  turnbul was busi settl someth loos in his elabor hilt  and the paus was broken by the stranger   suppos i call the polic  he said  with a heat face   and deni your most sacr dogma  said macian   dogma  cri the man  in a sort of dismay   oh  we have no dogmas  you know  there was anoth silenc  and he said again  airili   you know  i think  there  s someth in what shaw teach about no moral principl be quit fix  have you ever read the quintess of ibsenism  of cours he went veri wrong over the war  turnbul  with a bent  flush face  was tie up the loos piec of the pommel with string  with the string in his teeth  he said   oh  make up your damn mind and clear out   it  s a serious thing  said the philosoph  shake his head   i must be alon and consid which is the higher point of view  i rather feel that in a case so extrem as this  and he went slowli away  as he disappear among the tree  they heard him murmur in a sing  song voic   new occas teach new duti  out of a poem by jame russel lowel   ah  said macian  draw a deep breath   don  t you believ in prayer now  i pray for an angel   an hour ago  said the highland  in his heavi medit voic   i felt the devil weaken my heart and my oath against you  and i pray that god would send an angel to my aid   well  inquir the other  finish his mend and wrap the rest of the string round his hand to get a firmer grip   well   well  that man was an angel  said macian   i didn  t know they were as bad as that  answer turnbul   we know that devil sometim quot scriptur and counterfeit good  repli the mystic   whi should not angel sometim come to show us the black abyss of evil on whose brink we stand  if that man had not tri to stop us  i might  i might have stop   i know what you mean  said turnbul  grim   but then he came  broke out macian   and my soul said to me   give up fight  and you will becom like that  give up vow and dogma  and fix thing  and you may grow like that  you may learn  also  that fog of fals philosophi  you may grow fond of that mire of crawl  coward moral  and you may come to think a blow bad  becaus it hurt  and not becaus it humili  you may come to think murder wrong  becaus it is violent  and not becaus it is unjust  oh  you blasphem of the good  an hour ago i almost love you  but do not fear for me now  i have heard the word love pronounc in his inton  and i know exact what it mean  on guard  the sword caught on each other with a dread clang and jar  full of the old energi and hate  and at onc plung and replung  onc more each man  s heart had becom the magnet of a mad sword  sudden  furious as they were  they were frozen for a moment motionless   what nois is that  ask the highland  hoars   i think i know  repli turnbul   what  what  cri the other   the student of shaw and tolstoy has made up his remark mind  said turnbul  quiet   the polic are come up the hill  vi  the other philosoph between high hedg in hertfordshir  hedg so high as to creat a kind of grove  two men were run  they did not run in a scamper or feverish manner  but in the steadi swing of the pendulum  across the great plain and upland to the right and left of the lane  a long tide of sunset light roll like a sea of rubi  light up the long terrac of the hill and pick out the few window of the scatter hamlet in startl blood  red spark  but the lane was cut deep in the hill and remain in an abrupt shadow  the two men run in it had an impress not uncommon experienc between those wild green english wall  a sens of be led between the wall of a maze  though their pace was steadi it was vigor  their face were heat and their eye fix and bright  there was  inde  someth a littl mad in the contrast between the even  s still over the empti countri  side  and these two figur flee wild from noth  they had the look of two lunat  possibl they were   are you all right  said turnbul  with civil   can you keep this up   quit easili  thank you  repli macian   i run veri well   is that a qualif in a famili of warrior  ask turnbul   undoubt  rapid movement is essenti  answer macian  who never saw a joke in his life  turnbul broke out into a short laugh  and silenc fell between them  the pant silenc of runner  then macian said   we run better than ani of those policemen  they are too fat  whi do you make your policemen so fat   i didn  t do much toward make them fat myself  repli turnbul  genial   but i flatter myself that i am now do someth toward make them thin  you  ll see they will be as lean as rake by the time they catch us  they will look like your friend  cardin man   but they won  t catch us  said macian  in his liter way   no  we beat them in the great militari art of run away  return the other   they won  t catch us unless  macian turn his long equin face inquir   unless what  he said  for turnbul had gone silent sudden  and seem to be listen intent as he ran as a hors doe with his ear turn back   unless what  repeat the highland   unless they do  what they have done  listen  macian slacken his trot  and turn his head to the trail they had left behind them  across two or three billow of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistak throb of hors  hoof   they have put the mount polic on us  said turnbul  short   good lord  one would think we were a revolut   so we are  said macian calm   what shall we do  shall we turn on them with our point   it may come to that  answer turnbul   though if it doe  i reckon that will be the last act  we must put it off if we can  and he stare and peer about him between the bush   if we could hide somewher the beast might go by us  he said   the polic have their fault  but thank god they  re ineffici  whi  here  s the veri thing  be quick and quiet  follow me  he sudden swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane  it was almost as high and smooth as a wall  and on the top of it the black hedg stood out over them as an angl  almost like a thatch roof of the lane  and the burn even sky look down at them through the tangl with red eye as of an armi of goblin  turnbul hoist himself up and broke the hedg with his bodi  as his head and shoulder rose abov it they turn to flame in the full glow as if lit up by an immens firelight  his red hair and beard look almost scarlet  and his pale face as bright as a boy  s  someth violent  someth that was at onc love and hatr  surg in the strang heart of the gael below him  he had an unutter sens of epic import  as if he were somehow lift all human into a prouder and more passion region of the air  as he swung himself up also into the even light he felt as if he were rise on enorm wing  legend of the morn of the world which he had heard in childhood or read in youth came back upon him in a cloudi splendour  purpl tale of wrath and friendship  like roland and oliv  or balin and balan  remind him of emot entangl  men who had love each other and then fought each other  men who had fought each other and then love each other  togeth made a mix but monstrous sens of moment  the crimson sea of the sunset seem to him like a burst out of some sacr blood  as if the heart of the world had broken  turnbul was wholli unaffect by ani written or spoken poetri  his was a power and prosaic mind  but even upon him there came for the moment someth out of the earth and the passion end of the sky  the onli evid was in his voic  which was still practic but a shade more quiet   do you see that summer  hous  look thing over there  he ask short   that will do for us veri well  keep himself free from the tangl of the hedg he stroll across a triangl of obscur kitchen garden  and approach a dismal shed or lodg a yard or two beyond it  it was a weather  stain hut of grey wood  which with all it desol retain a tag or two of trivial ornament  which suggest that the thing had onc been a sort of summer  hous  and the place probabl a sort of garden   that is quit invis from the road  said turnbul  as he enter it   and it will cover us up for the night  macian look at him grave for a few moment   sir  he said   i ought to say someth to you  i ought to say   hush  said turnbul  sudden lift his hand   be still  man  in the sudden silenc  the drum of the distant hors grew louder and louder with inconceiv rapid  and the cavalcad of polic rush by below them in the lane  almost with the roar and rattl of an express train   i ought to tell you  continu macian  still stare stolid at the other   that you are a great chief  and it is good to go to war behind you  turnbul said noth  but turn and look out of the foolish lattic of the littl window  then he said   we must have food and sleep first  when the last echo of their elud pursuer had die in the distant upland  turnbul began to unpack the provis with the easi air of a man at a picnic  he had just laid out the last item  put a bottl of wine on the floor  and a tin of salmon on the window  ledg  when the bottomless silenc of that forgotten place was broken  and it was broken by three heavi blow of a stick deliv upon the door  turnbul look up in the act of open a tin and stare silent at his companion  macian  s long  lean mouth had shut hard   who the devil can that be  said turnbul   god know  said the other   it might be god  again the sound of the wooden stick reverber on the wooden door  it was a curious sound and on consider did not resembl the ordinari effect of knock on a door for admitt  it was rather as if the point of a stick were plung again and again at the panel in an absurd attempt to make a hole in them  a wild look sprang into macian  s eye and he got up half stupid  with a kind of stagger  put his hand out and caught one of the sword   let us fight at onc  he cri   it is the end of the world   you  re overdon  macian  said turnbul  put him on one side   it  s onli someon play the goat  let me open the door  but he also pick up a sword as he step to open it  he paus one moment with his hand on the handl and then flung the door open  almost as he did so the ferrul of an ordinari bamboo cane came at his eye  so that he had actual to parri it with the nake weapon in his hand  as the two touch  the point of the stick was drop veri abrupt  and the man with the stick step hurri back  against the herald background of sprawl crimson and gold offer him by the expir sunset  the figur of the man with the stick show at first mere black and fantast  he was a small man with two wisp of long hair that curl up on each side  and seen in silhouett  look like horn  he had a bow tie so big that the two end show on each side of his neck like unnatur stunt wing  he had his long black cane still tilt in his hand like a fenc foil and half present at the open door  his larg straw hat had fallen behind him as he leapt backward   with refer to your suggest  macian  said turnbul  placid   i think it look more like the devil   who on earth are you  cri the stranger in a high shrill voic  brandish his cane defens   let me see  said turnbul  look round to macian with the same bland   who are we   come out  scream the littl man with the stick   certain  said turnbul  and went outsid with the sword  macian follow  seen more fulli  with the even light on his face  the strang man look a littl less like a goblin  he wore a squar pale  grey jacket suit  on which the grey butterfli tie was the onli indisput touch of affect  against the great sunset his figur had look mere small  seen in a more equal light it look toler compact and shape  his reddish  brown hair  comb into two great curl  look like the long  slow curl hair of the women in some pre  raphaelit pictur  but within this feminin frame of hair his face was unexpect impud  like a monkey  s   what are you do here  he said  in a sharp small voic   well  said macian  in his grave childish way   what are you do here   i  said the man  indign   i  m in my own garden   oh  said macian  simpli   i apolog  turnbul was coolli curl his red moustach  and the stranger stare from one to the other  temporarili stun by their innoc assur   but

languag  that we cannot admit ani interfer   we were just go to take some slight refresh when you interrupt us  the littl man had a dawn express of understand and stoop and pick up the unus bottl of

step to the door of a tini but veri clean cottag  there was noth about the outsid to distinguish it from other cottag  except inde it omin cleanli and one thing that was out of all the custom and tradit of all cottag under the sun  in the middl of the littl garden among the stock and marigold there surg up in shapeless stone a south sea island idol  there was someth gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innoc of the english flower   come in  cri the creatur again   come in  it  s better insid  whether or no it was better insid it was at least a surpris  the moment the two duellist had push open the door of that inoffens  whitewash cottag they found that it interior was line with fieri gold  it was like step into a chamber in the arabian night  the door that close behind them shut out england and all the energi of the west  the ornament that shone and shimmer on everi side of them were subt mix from mani period and land  but were all orient  cruel assyrian bas  relief ran along the side of the passag  cruel turkish sword and dagger glint abov and below them  the two were separ by age and fallen civil  yet they seem to sympath sinc they were

flower  in the midst of which the monstrous south sea idol lift itself as abrupt as the prow of a ship ride on a sea of red and white and gold  it was with a start  therefor  that they came upon the man himself alreadi in the garden  they were all the more startl becaus of the still postur in which they found him  he was on his knee in front of the stone idol  rigid and motionless  like a saint in a tranc or ecstasi  yet when turnbul  s tread broke a twig  he was on his feet in a flash   excus me  he said with an irradi of smile  but yet with a kind of bewilder   so sorri  famili prayer  old fashion  mother  s knee  let us go on to the lawn behind  and he duck rapid round the statu to an open space of grass on the other side of it   this will do us best  mr  macian  said he  then he made

hand him the weapon  macian took the second sword in his left hand and  with a violent gestur  hurl it at the feet of littl mr  wimpey   fight  he said in a loud  harsh voic   fight me now  wimpey took a step backward  and bewild word bubbl on his lip   pick up that sword and fight me  repeat macian  with brow as black as thunder  the littl man turn to turnbul with a gestur  demand judgement or protect   realli  sir  he began   this gentleman confus   you stink littl coward  roar turnbul  sudden releas his wrath   fight  if you  re so fond of fight  fight  if you  re so fond of all that filthi philosophi  if win is everyth  go in and win  if the weak must go to the wall  go to the wall  fight  you rat  fight  or if you won  t fight  run  and he ran at wimpey  with blaze eye  wimpey stagger back a few pace like a man struggl with his own limb  then he felt the furious scotchman come at him like an express train  doubl his size everi second  with eye as big as window and a sword as bright as the sun  someth broke insid him  and he found himself run away  tumbl over his own feet in terror  and cri out as he ran   chase him  shout turnbul as macian snatch up the sword and join in the scamper   chase him over a counti  chase him into the sea  shoo  shoo  shoo  the littl man plung like a rabbit among the tall flower  the two duellist after him  turnbul kept at his tail with savag ecstasi  still shoo him like a cat  but macian  as he ran past the south sea idol  paus an instant to spring upon it pedest  for five second he strain against the inert mass  then it stir  and he sent it over with a great crash among the flower  that engulf it altogeth  then he went bound after the runaway  in the energi of his alarm the ex  fellow of magdalen manag to leap the pale of his garden  the two pursuer went over it after him like fli bird  he fled frantic down a long lane with his two terror on his trail till he came to a gap in the hedg and went across a steep meadow like the wind  the two scotchmen  as they ran  kept up a cheeri bellow and wave their sword  up three slant meadow  down four slant meadow on the other side  across anoth road  across a heath of snap bracken  through a wood  across anoth road  and to the brink of a big pool  they pursu the fli philosoph  but when he came to the pool his pace was so precipit that he could not stop it  and with a kind of lurch stagger  he fell splash into the greasi water  get drip to his feet  with the water up to his knee  the worshipp of forc and victori wade disconsol to the other side and drew himself on to the bank  and turnbul sat down on the grass and went off into reverber of laughter  a second afterward the most extraordinari grimac were seen to distort the stiff face of macian  and unholi sound came from within  he had never practis laugh  and it hurt him veri much  vii  the villag of grassley  in  the  hole at about half past one  under a strong blue sky  turnbul got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lie  and his still intermitt laughter end in a kind of yawn   i  m hungri  he said short   are you   i have not notic  answer macian   what are you go to do   there  s a villag down the road  past the pool  answer turnbul   i can see it from here  i can see the whitewash wall of some cottag and a kind of corner of the church  how jolli it all look  it look so  i don  t know what the word is  so sensibl  don  t fanci i  m under ani illus about arcadian virtu and the innoc villag  men make beast of themselv there with drink  but they don  t deliber make devil of themselv with mere talk  they kill wild anim in the wild wood  but they don  t kill cat to the god of victori  they don  t  he broke off and sudden spat on the ground   excus me  he said   it was ceremoni  one has to get the tast out of one  s mouth   the tast of what  ask macian   i don  t know the exact name for it  repli turnbul   perhap it is the south sea island  or it may be magdalen colleg  there was a long paus  and macian also lift his larg limb off the ground  his eye particular dreami   i know what you mean  turnbul  he said   but  i alway thought you peopl agre with all that   with all that about do as one like  and the individu  and natur love the strongest  and all the thing which that cockroach talk about  turnbul  s big blue  grey eye stood open with a grave astonish   do you realli mean to say  macian  he said   that you fanci that we  the free  thinker  that bradlaugh  or holyoak  or ingersol  believ all that dirti  immor mystic about natur  damn natur   i suppos you did  said macian calm   it seem to me your most conclus posit   and you mean to tell me  rejoin the other   that you broke my window  and challeng me to mortal combat  and tie a tradesman up with rope  and chase an oxford fellow across five meadow  all under the impress that i am such an illiter idiot as to believ in natur   i suppos you did  repeat macian with his usual mild   but i admit that i know littl of the detail of your belief  or disbelief  turnbul swung round quit sudden  and set off toward the villag   come along  he cri   come down to the villag  come down to the nearest decent inhabit pub  this is a case for beer   i do not quit follow you  said the highland   yes  you do  answer turnbul   you follow me slap into the inn  parlour  i repeat  this is a case for beer  we must have the whole of this matter out thorough befor we go a step farther  do you know that an idea has just struck me of great simplic and of some cogenc  do not by ani mean let us drop our intent of settl our differ with two steel sword  but do you not think that with two pewter pot we might do what we realli have never thought of do yet  discov what our differ is   it never occur to me befor  answer macian with tranquil   it is a good suggest  and they set out at an easi swing down the steep road to the villag of grassley  in  the  hole  grassley  in  the  hole was a rude parallelogram of build  with two thoroughfar which might have been call two high street if it had been possibl to call them street  one of these way was higher on the slope than the other  the whole parallelogram lie aslant  so to speak  on the side of the hill  the upper of these two road was decor with a big public hous  a butcher  s shop  a small public hous  a sweetstuff shop  a veri small public hous  and an illeg signpost  the lower of the two road boast a hors  pond  a post offic  a gentleman  s garden with veri high hedg  a microscop small public hous  and two cottag  where all the peopl live who support all the public hous was in this  as in mani other english villag  a silent and smile mysteri  the church lay a littl abov and beyond the villag  with a squar grey tower domin it decis  but even the church was scarc so central and solemn an institut as the larg public hous  the valencourt arm  it was name after some splendid famili that had long gone bankrupt  and whose seat was occupi by a man who had invent a hygien bootjack  but the unfathom sentiment of the english peopl insist in regard the inn  the seat and the sitter in it  as alik part of a pure and marmor antiqu  and in the valencourt arm festiv itself had some solemn and decorum  and beer was drunk with rever  as it ought to be  into the princip parlour of this place enter two stranger  who found themselv  as is alway the case in such hostel  the object  not of flutter curios or pert inquiri  but of steadi  ceaseless  devour ocular studi  they had long coat down to their heel  and carri under each coat someth that look like a stick  one was tall and dark  the other short and red  hair  they order a pot of ale each   macian  said turnbul  lift his tankard   the fool who want us to be friend made us want to go on fight  it is onli natur that the fool who want us to fight should make us friend  macian  your health  dusk was alreadi drop  the rustic in the tavern were alreadi lurch and lumber out of it by twos and three  cri clamor good night to a solitari old toper that remain  befor macian and turnbul had reach the realli import part of their discuss  macian wore an express of sad bewilder not uncommon with him   i am to understand  then  he said   that you don  t believ in natur   you may say so in a veri special and emphat sens  said turnbul   i do not believ in natur  just as i do not believ in odin  she is a myth  it is not mere that i do not believ that natur can guid us  it is that i do not believ that natur exist   exist  said macian in his monoton way  settl his pewter pot on the tabl   yes  in a real sens natur doe not exist  i mean that nobodi can discov what the origin natur of thing would have been if thing had not interf with it  the first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it  it was interf with natur  if there is ani natur  the first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it  he was interf with natur  if there is ani natur  in the same way  continu turnbul   the human when it assert it domin over natur is just as natur as the thing which it destroy   and in the same way  said macian almost dreamili   the superhuman  the supernatur is just as natur as the natur which it destroy  turnbul took his head out of his pewter pot in some anger   the supernatur  of cours  he said   is quit anoth thing  the case of the supernatur is simpl  the supernatur doe not exist   quit so  said macian in a rather dull voic   you said the same about the natur  if the natur doe not exist the supernatur obvious can  t  and he yawn a littl over his ale  turnbul turn for some reason a littl red and remark quick   that may be jolli clever  for all i know  but everyon doe know that there is a divis between the thing that as a matter of fact do common happen and the thing that don  t  thing that break the evid law of natur   which doe not exist  put in macian sleepili  turnbul struck the tabl with a sudden hand   good lord in heaven  he cri   who doe not exist  murmur macian   good lord in heaven  thunder turnbul  without regard the interrupt   do you realli mean to sit there and say that you  like anybodi els  would not recogn the differ between a natur occurr and a supernatur one  if there could be such a thing  if i flew up to the ceil   you would bump your head bad  cri macian  sudden start up   one can  t talk of this kind of thing under a ceil at all  come outsid  come outsid and ascend into heaven  he burst the door open on a blue abyss of even and they step out into it  it was sudden and strang cool   turnbul  said macian   you have said some thing so true and some so fals that i want to talk  and i will tri to talk so that you understand  for at present you do not understand at all  we don  t seem to mean the same thing by the same word  he stood silent for a second or two and then resum   a minut or two ago i caught you out in a real contradict  at that moment logic i was right  and at that moment i knew i was wrong  yes  there is a real differ between the natur and the supernatur  if you flew up into that blue sky this instant  i should think that you were move by god  or the devil  but if you want to know what i realli think  i must explain  he stop again  abstract bore the point of his sword into the earth  and went on   i was born and bred and taught in a complet univers  the supernatur was not natur  but it was perfect reason  nay  the supernatur to me is more reason than the natur  for the supernatur is a direct messag from god  who is reason  i was taught that some thing are natur and some thing divin  i mean that some thing are mechan and some thing divin  but there is the great difficulti  turnbul  the great difficulti is that  accord to my teach  you are divin   me  divin  said turnbul trucul   what do you mean   that is just the difficulti  continu macian thought   i was told that there was a differ between the grass and a man  s will  and the differ was that a man  s will was special and divin  a man  s free will  i heard  was supernatur   rubbish  said turnbul   oh  said macian patient   then if a man  s free will isn  t supernatur  whi do your materialist deni that it exist  turnbul was silent for a moment  then he began to speak  but macian continu with the same steadi voic and sad eye   so what i feel is this  here is the great divin creation i was taught to believ in  i can understand your disbeliev in it  but whi disbeliev in a part of it  it was all one thing to me  god had author becaus he was god  man had author becaus he was man  you cannot prove that god is better than a man  nor can you prove that a man is better than a hors  whi permit ani ordinari thing  whi do you let a hors be saddl   some modern thinker disapprov of it  said turnbul a littl doubt   i know  said macian grim   that man who talk about love  for instanc  turnbul made a humor grimac  then he said   we seem to be talk in a kind of shorthand  but i won  t pretend not to understand you  what you mean is this  that you learnt about all your saint and angel at the same time as you learnt about common moral  from the same peopl  in the same way  and you mean to say that if one may be disput  so may the other  well  let that pass for the moment  but let me ask you a question in turn  did not this system of your  which you swallow whole  contain all sort of thing that were mere local  the respect for the chief of your clan  or such thing  the villag ghost  the famili feud  or what not  did you not take in those thing  too  along with your theolog  macian stare along the dim villag road  down which the last straggler from the inn was trail his way   what you say is not unreason  he said   but it is not quit true  the distinct between the chief and us did exist  but it was never anyth like the distinct between the human and the divin  or the human and the anim  it was more like the distinct between one anim and anoth  but   well  said turnbul  macian was silent   go on  repeat turnbul   what  s the matter with you  what are you stare at   i am stare  said macian at last   at that which shall judg us both   oh  yes  said turnbul in a tire way   i suppos you mean god   no  i don  t  said macian  shake his head   i mean him  and he point to the half  tipsi yokel who was plough down the road   what do you mean  ask the atheist   i mean him  repeat macian with emphasi   he goe out in the earli dawn  he dig or he plough a field  then he come back and drink ale  and then he sing a song  all your philosophi and polit system are young compar to him  all your hoari cathedr  yes  even the etern church on earth is new compar to him  the most moulder god in the british museum are new fact besid him  it is he who in the end shall judg us all  and macian rose to his feet with a vagu excit   what are you go to do   i am go to ask him  cri macian   which of us is right  turnbul broke into a kind of laugh   ask that intox turnip  eater  he began   yes  which of us is right  cri macian violent   oh  you have long word and i have long word  and i talk of everi man be the imag of god  and you talk of everi man be a citizen and enlighten enough to govern  but if everi man typifi god  there is god  if everi man is an enlighten citizen  there is your enlighten citizen  the first man one meet is alway man  let us catch him up  and in gigant stride the long  lean highland whirl away into the grey twilight  turnbul follow with a good  humour oath  the track of the rustic was easi to follow  even in the falter dark  for he was enliven his waver walk with song  it was an intermin poem  begin with some unspecifi king william  who  it appear  live in london town and who after the second rise vanish rather abrupt from the train of thought  the rest was almost entir about beer and was thick with local topographi of a quit unrecogniz kind  the singer  s step was neither veri rapid  nor  inde  except secur  so the song grew louder and louder and the two soon overtook him  he was a man elder or rather of ani age  with lean grey hair and a lean red face  but with that remark rustic physiognomi in which it seem that all the featur stand out independ from the face  the rug red nose go out like a limb  the blear blue eye stand out like signal  he gave them greet with the elabor urban of the slight intox  macian  who was vibrat with one of his silent  violent decis  open the question without delay  he explain the philosoph posit in word as short and simpl as possibl  but the singular old man with the lank red face seem to think uncommon littl of the short word  he fix with a fierc affect upon one or two of the long one   atheist  he repeat with luxuri scorn   atheist  i know their sort  master  atheist  don  t talk to me about  un  atheist  the ground of his disdain seem a littl dark and confus  but they were evid suffici  macian resum in some encourag   you think as i do  i hope  you think that a man should be connect with the church  with the common christian  the old man extend a quiver stick in the direct of a distant hill   there  s the church  he said thick   grassley old church that is  pull down it was  in the old squir  s time  and   i mean  explain macian elabor   that you think that there should be someon typifi religion  a priest   priest  said the old man with sudden passion   priest  i know  un  what they want in england  that  s what i say  what they want in england   they want you  said macian   quit so  said turnbul   and me  but they won  t get us  macian  your attempt on the primit innoc doe not seem veri success  let me tri  what you want  my friend  is your right  you don  t want ani priest or church  a vote  a right to speak is what you   who say i a  n  t got a right to speak  said the old man  face round in an irrat frenzi   i got a right to speak  i  m a man  i am  i don  t want no votin  nor priest  i say a man  s a man  that  s what i say  if a man a  n  t a man  what is he  that  s what i say  if a man a  n  t a man  what is he  when i see a man  i sez  e  s a man   quit so  said turnbul   a citizen   i say he  s a man  said the rustic furious  stop and strike his stick on the ground   not a citi or owt els  he  s a man   you  re perfect right  said the sudden voic of macian  fall like a sword   and you have kept close to someth the whole world of today tri to forget   good night  and the old man went on wild sing into the night   a jolli old creatur  said turnbul   he didn  t seem abl to get much beyond that fact that a man is a man   has anybodi got beyond it  ask macian  turnbul look at him curious   are you turn an agnost  he ask   oh  you do not understand  cri out macian   we cathol are all agnost  we cathol have onli in that sens got as far as realiz that man is a man  but your ibsen and your zola and your shaw and your tolstoy have not even got so far  viii  an interlud of argument morn broke in bitter silver along the grey and level plain  and almost as it did so turnbul and macian came out of a low  scrubbi wood on to the empti and desol flat  they had walk all night  they had walk all night and talk all night also  and if the subject had been capabl of be exhaust they would have exhaust it  their long and chang argument had taken them through district and landscap equal chang  they had discuss haeckel upon hill so high and steep that in spite of the cold of the night it seem as if the star might burn them  they had explain and re  explain the massacr of st  bartholomew in littl white lane wall in with stand corn as with wall of gold  they had talk about mr  kensit in dim and twinkl pine wood  amid the bewild monotoni of the pine  and it was with the end of a long speech from macian  passion defend the practic achiev and the solid prosper of the cathol tradit  that they came out upon the open land  macian had learnt much and thought more sinc he came out of the cloudi hill of arisaig  he had met mani typic modern figur under circumst which were sharpli symbol  and  moreov  he had absorb the main modern atmospher from the mere presenc and chanc phrase of turnbul  as such atmospher can alway be absorb from the presenc and the phrase of ani man of great mental vital  he had at last begun thorough to understand what are the ground upon which the mass of the modern world solid disapprov of her creed  and he threw himself into repli to them with a hot intellectu enjoy   i begin to understand one or two of your dogma  mr  turnbul  he had said emphat as they plough heavili up a wood hill   and everi one that i understand i deni  take ani one of them you like  you hold that your heret and sceptic have help the world forward and hand on a lamp of progress  i deni it  noth is plainer from real histori than that each of your heret invent a complet cosmos of his own which the next heret smash entir to piec  who know now exact what nestorius taught  who care  there are onli two thing that we know for certain about it  the first is that nestorius  as a heret  taught someth quit opposit to the teach of arius  the heret who came befor him  and someth quit useless to jame turnbul  the heret who come after  i defi you to go back to the free  thinker of the past and find ani habit for yourself at all  i defi you to read godwin or shelley or the deist of the eighteenth centuri of the natur  worship humanist of the renaiss  without discov that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the pope  you are a nineteenth  centuri sceptic  and you are alway tell me that i ignor the cruelti of natur  if you had been an eighteenth  centuri sceptic you would have told me that i ignor the kind and benevol of natur  you are an atheist  and you prais the deist of the eighteenth centuri  read them instead of prais them  and you will find that their whole univers stand or fall with the deiti  you are a materialist  and you think bruno a scientif hero  see what he said and you will think him an insan mystic  no  the great free  thinker  with his genuin abil and honesti  doe not in practic destroy christian  what he doe destroy is the free  thinker who went befor  free  thought may be suggest  it may be inspirit  it may have as much as you pleas of the merit that come from vivac and varieti  but there is one thing free  thought can never be by ani possibl  free  thought can never be progress  it can never be progress becaus it will accept noth from the past  it begin everi time again from the begin  and it goe everi time in a differ direct  all the ration philosoph have gone along differ road  so it is imposs to say which has gone farthest  who can discuss whether emerson was a better optimist than schopenhau was pessimist  it is like ask if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep  no  there are onli two thing that realli progress  and they both accept accumul of author  they may be progress uphil and down  they may be grow steadili better or steadili wors  but they have steadili increas in certain defin matter  they have steadili advanc in a certain defin direct  they are the onli two thing  it seem  that ever can progress  the first is strict physic scienc  the second is the cathol church   physic scienc and the cathol church  said turnbul sarcast   and no doubt the first owe a great deal to the second   if you press that point i might repli that it was veri probabl  answer macian calm   i often fanci that your histor general rest frequent on random instanc  i should not be surpris if your vagu notion of the church as the persecutor of scienc was a general from galileo  i should not be at all surpris if  when you count the scientif investig and discoveri sinc the fall of rome  you found that a great mass of them had been made by monk  but the matter is irrelev to my mean  i say that if you want an exampl of anyth which has progress in the moral world by the same method as scienc in the materi world  by continu ad to without unsettl what was there befor  then i say that there is onli one exampl of it  and that is us   with this enorm differ  said turnbul   that howev elabor be the calcul of physic scienc  their net result can be test  grant that it took million of book i never read and million of men i never heard of to discov the electr light  still i can see the electr light  but i cannot see the suprem virtu which is the result of all your theolog and sacrament   cathol virtu is often invis becaus it is the normal  answer macian   christian is alway out of fashion becaus it is alway sane  and all fashion are mild insan  when itali is mad on art the church seem too puritan  when england is mad on puritan the church seem too artist  when you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despot  but when you quarrel with us first it was becaus we would not accept the divin despot of henri viii  the church alway seem to be behind the time  when it is realli beyond the time  it is wait till the last fad shall have seen it last summer  it keep the key of a perman virtu   oh  i have heard all that  said turnbul with genial contempt   i have heard that christian keep the key of virtu  and that if you read tom pain you will cut your throat at mont carlo  it is such rubbish that i am not even angri at it  you say that christian is the prop of moral  but what more do you do  when a doctor attend you and could poison you with a pinch of salt  do you ask whether he is a christian  you ask whether he is a gentleman  whether he is an m  d  anyth but that  when a soldier enlist to die for his countri or disgrac it  do you ask whether he is a christian  you are more like to ask whether he is oxford or cambridg at the boat race  if you think your creed essenti to moral whi do you not make it a test for these thing   we onc did make it a test for these thing  said macian smile   and then you told us that we were impos by forc a faith unsupport by argument  it seem rather hard that have first been told that our creed must be fals becaus we did use test  we should now be told that it must be fals becaus we don  t  but i notic that most anti  christian argument are in the same inconsist style   that is all veri well as a debat  club answer  repli turnbul good  humour   but the question still remain  whi don  t you confin yourself more to christian if christian are the onli realli good men   who talk of such folli  ask macian disdain   do you suppos that the cathol church ever held that christian were the onli good men  whi  the cathol of the cathol middl age talk about the virtu of all the virtuous pagan until human was sick of the subject  no  if you realli want to know what we mean when we say that christian has a special power of virtu  i will tell you  the church is the onli thing on earth that can perpetu a type of virtu and make it someth more than a fashion  the thing is so plain and histor that i hard think you will ever deni it  you cannot deni that it is perfect possibl that tomorrow morn  in ireland or in itali  there might appear a man not onli as good but good in exact the same way as st  franci of assisi  veri well  now take the other type of human virtu  mani of them splendid  the english gentleman of elizabeth was chivalr and idealist  but can you stand still here in this meadow and be an english gentleman of elizabeth  the auster republican of the eighteenth centuri  with his stern patriot and his simpl life  was a fine fellow  but have you ever seen him  have you ever seen an auster republican  onli a hundr year have pass and that volcano of revolutionari truth and valour is as cold as the mountain of the moon  and so it is and so it will be with the ethic which are buzz down fleet street at this instant as i speak  what phrase would inspir the london clerk or workman just now  perhap that he is a son of the british empir on which the sun never set  perhap that he is a prop of his trade union  or a class  conscious proletarian someth or other  perhap mere that he is a gentleman when he obvious is not  those name and notion are all honour  but how long will they last  empir break  industri condit chang  the suburb will not last for ever  what will remain  i will tell you  the cathol saint will remain   and suppos i don  t like him  said turnbul   on my theori the question is rather whether he will like you  or more probabl whether he will ever have heard of you  but i grant the reason of your queri  you have a right  if you speak as the ordinari man  to ask if you will like the saint  but as the ordinari man you do like him  you revel in him  if you dislik him it is not becaus you are a nice ordinari man  but becaus you are  if you will excus me  a sophist prig of a fleet street editor  that is just the funni part of it  the human race has alway admir the cathol virtu  howev littl it can practis them  and odd enough it has admir most those of them that the modern world most sharpli disput  you complain of catholic for set up an ideal of virgin  it did noth of the kind  the whole human race set up an ideal of virgin  the greek in athen  the roman in the vestal fire  set up an ideal of virgin  what then is your real quarrel with catholic  your quarrel can onli be  your quarrel realli onli is  that catholic has achieved an ideal of virgin  that it is no longer a mere piec of float poetri  but if you  and a few feverish men  in top hat  run about in a street in london  choos to differ as to the ideal itself  not onli from the church  but from the parthenon whose name mean virgin  from the roman empir which went outward from the virgin flame  from the whole legend and tradit of europ  from the lion who will not touch virgin  from the unicorn who respect them  and who make up togeth the bearer of your own nation shield  from the most live and lawless of your own poet  from massing  who wrote the virgin martyr  from shakespear  who wrote measur for measure  if you in fleet street differ from all this human experi  doe it never strike you that it may be fleet street that is wrong   no  answer turnbul   i trust that i am suffici fair  mind to canvass and consid the idea  but have consid it  i think fleet street is right  yes  even if the parthenon is wrong  i think that as the world goe on new psycholog atmospher are generat  and in these atmospher it is possibl to find delicaci and combin which in other time would have to be repres by some ruder symbol  everi man feel the need of some element of puriti in sex  perhap they can onli typifi puriti as the absenc of sex  you will laugh if i suggest that we may have made in fleet street an atmospher in which a man can be so passion as sir lancelot and as pure as sir galahad  but  after all  we have in the modern world erect mani such atmospher  we have  for instanc  a new and imagin appreci of children   quit so  repli macian with a singular smile   it has been veri well put by one of the brightest of your young author  who said   unless you becom as littl children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven  but you are quit right  there is a modern worship of children  and what  i ask you  is this modern worship of children  what  in the name of all the angel and devil  is it except a worship of virgin  whi should anyon worship a thing mere becaus it is small or immatur  no  you have tri to escap from this thing  and the veri thing you point to as the goal of your escap is onli the thing again  am i wrong in say that these thing seem to be etern  and it was with these word that they came in sight of the great plain  they went a littl way in silenc  and then jame turnbul said sudden   but i cannot believ in the thing  macian answer noth to the speech  perhap it is unanswer  and inde they scarc spoke anoth word to each other all that day  ix  the strang ladi moonris with a great and grow moon open over all those flat  make them seem flatter and larger than they were  turn them to a lake of blue light  the two companion trudg across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silenc  then macian stop sudden and plant his sword  point in the ground like one who plant his tent  pole for the night  leav it stand there  he clutch his black  hair skull with his great claw of hand  as was his custom when forc the pace of his brain  then his hand drop again and he spoke   i  m sure you  re think the same as i am  he said   how long are we to be on this damn seesaw  the other did not answer  but his silenc seem somehow solid as assent  and macian went on convers  neither notic that both had instinct stood still befor the sign of the fix and stand sword   it is hard to guess what god mean in this busi  but he mean someth  or the other thing  or both  whenev we have tri to fight each other someth has stop us  whenev we have tri to be reconcil to each other  someth has stop us again  by the run of our luck we have never had time to be either friend or enemi  someth alway jump out of the bush  turnbul nod grave and glanc round at the huge and hedgeless meadow which fell away toward the horizon into a glimmer high road   noth will jump out of bush here anyhow  he said   that is what i meant  said macian  and stare steadili at the heavi hilt of his stand sword  which in the slight wind sway on it temper steel like some huge thistl on it stalk   that is what i meant  we are quit alon here  i have not heard a hors  hoof or a footstep or the hoot of a train for mile  so i think we might stop here and ask for a miracl   oh  might we  said the atheist editor with a sort of gusto of disgust   i beg your pardon  said macian  meek   i forgot your prejudic  he eye the wind  swung sword  hilt in sad medit and resum   what i mean is  we might find out in this quiet place whether there realli is ani fate or ani command against our enterpris  i will engag on my side  like elijah  to accept a test from heaven  turnbul  let us draw sword here in this moonlight and this monstrous solitud  and if here in this moonlight and solitud there happen anyth to interrupt us  if it be lightn strike our sword  blade or a rabbit run under our leg  i will take it as a sign from god and we will shake hand for ever  turnbul  s mouth twitch in angri humour under his red moustach  he said   i will wait for sign from god until i have ani sign of his exist  but god  or fate  forbid that a man of scientif cultur should refus ani kind of experi   veri well  then  said macian  short   we are more quiet here than anywher els  let us engag  and he pluck his sword  point out of the turf  turnbul regard him for a second and a half with a baffl visag almost black against the moonris  then his hand made a sharp movement to his hip and his sword shone in the moon  as old chess  player open everi game with establish gambit  they open with a thrust and parri  orthodox and even frank ineffectu  but in macian  s soul more formless storm were gather  and he made a lung or two so savag as first to surpris and then to enrag his oppon  turnbul ground his teeth  kept his temper  and wait for the third lung  and the worst  had almost spit the lunger when a shrill  small cri came from behind him  a cri such as is not made by ani of the beast that perish  turnbul must have been more superstiti than he knew  for he stop in the act of go forward  macian was brazen superstiti  and he drop his sword  after all  he had challeng the univers to send an interrupt  and this was an interrupt  whatev els it was  an instant afterward the sharp  weak cri was repeat  this time it was certain that it was human and that it was femal  macian stood roll those great blue gaelic eye that contrast with his dark hair   it is the voic of god  he said again and again   god hasn  t got much of a voic  said turnbul  who snatch at everi chanc of cheap profan   as a matter of fact  macian  it isn  t the voic of god  but it  s someth a jolli sight more import  it is the voic of man  or rather of woman  so i think we  d better scoot in it direct  macian snatch up his fallen weapon without a word  and the two race away toward that part of the distant road from which the cri was now constant renew  they had to run over a curv of countri that look smooth but was veri rough  a neglect field which they soon found to be full of the tallest grass and the deepest rabbit  hole  moreov  that great curv of the countrysid which look so slow and gentl when you glanc over it  prove to be high precipit when you scamper over it  and turnbul was twice near flung on his face  macian  though much heavier  avoid such an overthrow onli by have the quick and incalcul feet of the mountain  but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road  the moonlight lay on the white road with a more nake and electr glare than on the grey  green upland  and though the scene which it reveal was complic  it was not difficult to get it first featur at a glanc  a small but veri neat black  and  yellow motor  car was stand stolid  slight to the left of the road  a somewhat larger light  green motor  car was tip half  way into a ditch on the same side  and four flush and stagger men in even dress were tip out of it  three of them were stand about the road  give their opinion to the moon with vagu but echo violenc  the fourth  howev  had alreadi advanc on the chauffeur of the black  and  yellow car  and was threaten him with a stick  the chauffeur had risen to defend himself  by his side sat a young ladi  she was sit bolt upright  a slender and rigid figur grip the side of her seat  and her first few cri had ceas  she was clad in close  fit dark costum  a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wing or wave on each side of her forehead  and even at that distanc it could be seen that her profil was of the aquilin and eager sort  like a young falcon hard free of the nest  turnbul had conceal in him somewher a fund of common sens and knowledg of the world of which he himself and his best friend were hard awar  he was one of those who take in much of the show of thing absent  mind  and in an irrelev reveri  as he stood at the door of his editori shop on ludgat hill and medit on the non  exist of god  he silent absorb a good deal of vari knowledg about the exist of men  he had come to know type by instinct and dilemma with a glanc  he saw the crux of the situat in the road  and what he saw made him redoubl his pace  he knew that the men were rich  he knew that they were drunk  and he knew  what was worst of all  that they were fundament frighten  and he knew this also  that no common ruffian  such as attack ladi in novel  is ever so savag and ruthless as a coars kind of gentleman when he is realli alarm  the reason is not recondit  it is simpli becaus the polic  court is not such a menac novelti to the poor ruffian as it is to the rich  when they came within hail and heard the voic  they confirm all turnbul  s anticip  the man in the middl of the road was shout in a hoars and groggi voic that the chauffeur had smash their car on purpos  that they must get to the cri that even  and that he would jolli well have to take them there  the chauffeur had mild object that he was drive a ladi   oh  we  ll take care of the ladi  said the red  face young man  and went off into gurgl and almost senil laughter  by the time the two champion came up  thing had grown more serious  the intox of the man talk to the chauffeur had taken one of it pervers and catlik jump into mere scream spite and rage  he lift his stick and struck at the chauffeur  who caught hold of it  and the drunkard fell backward  drag him out of his seat on the car  anoth of the rowdi rush forward boo in idiot excit  fell over the chauffeur  and  either by accid or design  kick him as he lay  the drunkard got to his feet again  but the chauffeur did not  the man who had kick kept a kind of half  wit conscienc or cowardic  for he stood stare at the senseless bodi and murmur word of inconsequ self  justif  make gestur with his hand as if he were argu with somebodi  but the other three  with a mere whoop and howl of victori  were board the car on three side at onc  it was exact at this moment that turnbul fell among them like one fallen from the sky  he tore one of the climber backward by the collar  and with a hearti push sent him stagger over into the ditch upon his nose  one of the remain two  who was too far gone to notic anyth  continu to clamber ineffectu over the high back of the car  kick and pour forth a rivulet of soliloquy  but the other drop at the interrupt  turn upon turnbul and began a batter bout of fisticuff  at the same moment the man crawl out of the ditch in a masquerad of mud and rush at his old enemi from behind  the whole had not taken a second  and an instant after macian was in the midst of them  turnbul had toss away his sheath sword  great prefer his hand  except in the avow etiquett of the duel  for he had learnt to use his hand in the old street  battl of bradlaugh  but to macian the sword even sheath was a more natur weapon  and he laid about him on all side with it as with a stick  the man who had the walk  stick found his blow parri with promptitud  and a second after  to his great astonish  found his own stick fli up in the air as by a conjur trick  with a turn of the swordsman  s wrist  anoth of the revel pick the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon macian  call to his companion to assist him   i haven  t got a stick  grumbl the disarm man  and look vagu about the ditch   perhap  said macian  polit   you would like this one  with the word the drunkard found his hand that had grasp the stick sudden twist and empti  and the stick lay at the feet of his companion on the other side of the road  macian felt a faint stir behind him  the girl had risen to her feet and was lean forward to stare at the fighter  turnbul was still engag in counter and pommel with the third young man  the fourth young man was still engag with himself  kick his leg in helpless rotat on the back of the car and talk with melodi ration  at length turnbul  s oppon began to back befor the batteri of his heavi hand  still fight  for he was the soberest and boldest of the four  if these are annal of militari glori  it is due to him to say that he need not have abandon the conflict  onli that as he back to the edg of the ditch his foot caught in a loop of grass and he went over in a flat and comfort posit from which it took him a consider time to rise  by the time he had risen  turnbul had come to the rescu of macian  who was at bay but belabour his two enemi handsom  the sight of the liber reserv was to them like that of blucher at waterloo  the two set off at a sullen trot down the road  leav even the walk  stick lie behind them in the moonlight  macian pluck the struggl and aspir idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat  and left him sway unsteadili in the moon  then he approach the front part of the car in a somewhat embarrass manner and pull off his cap  for some solid second the ladi and he mere look at each other  and macian had an irrat feel of be in a pictur hung on a wall  that is  he was motionless  even lifeless  and yet stare signific  like a pictur  the white moonlight on the road  when he was not look at it  gave him a vision of the road be white with snow  the motor  car  when he was not look at it  gave him a rude impress of a captur coach in the old day of highwaymen  and he whose whole soul was with the sword and state manner of the eighteenth centuri  he who was a jacobit risen from the dead  had an overwhelm sens of be onc more in the pictur  when he had so long been out of the pictur  in that short and strong silenc he absorb the ladi from head to foot  he had never realli look at a human be befor in his life  he saw her face and hair first  then that she had long sued glove  then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair  he might  perhap  be excus for this hungri attent  he had pray that some sign might come from heaven  and after an almost savag scrutini he came to the conclus that his one did  the ladi  s instantan arrest of speech might need more explain  but she may well have been stun with the squalid attack and the abrupt rescu  yet it was she who rememb herself first and sudden call out with self  accus horror   oh  that poor  poor man  they both swung round abrupt and saw that turnbul  with his recov sword under his arm  pit  was alreadi lift the fallen chauffeur into the car  he was onli stun and was slowli awaken  feebli wave his left arm  the ladi in long glove and the fur cap leapt out and ran rapid toward them  onli to be reassur by turnbul  who  unlik mani of his school  realli knew a littl scienc when he invok it to redeem the world   he  s all right  said he   he  s quit safe  but i  m afraid he won  t be abl to drive the car for half an hour or so   i can drive the car  said the young woman in the fur cap with stoni practic   oh  in that case  began macian  uneasili  and that paralys shyness which is a part of romanc induc him to make a backward movement as if leav her to herself  but turnbul was more ration than he  be more indiffer   i don  t think you ought to drive home alon  ma  am  he said  gruffli   there seem to be a lot of rowdi parti along this road  and the man will be no use for an hour  if you will tell us where you are go  we will see you safe there and say good night  the young ladi exhibit all the abrupt disturb of a person who is not common disturb  she said almost sharpli and yet with evid sincer   of cours i am aw grate to you for all you  ve done  and there  s plenti of room if you  ll come in  turnbul  with the complet innoc of an absolut sound motiv  immedi jump into the car  but the girl cast an eye at macian  who stood in the road for an instant as if root like a tree  then he also tumbl his long leg into the tonneau  have that sens of degrad dive into heaven which so mani have known in so mani human hous when they consent to stop to tea or were allow to stop to supper  the slowli reviv chauffeur was set in the back seat  turnbul and macian had fallen into the middl one  the ladi with a steeli cool had taken the driver  s seat and all the handl of that headlong machin  a moment afterward the engin start  with a throb and leap unfamiliar to turnbul  who had onli onc been in a motor dure a general elect  and utter unknown to macian  who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world  almost at the same instant that the car pluck itself out of the mud and whip away up the road  the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waver to his feet  when he saw the car escap he ran after it and shout someth which  owe to the increas distanc  could not be heard  it is aw to reflect that  if his remark was valuabl  it is quit lost to the world  the car shot on up and down the shine moonlit lane  and there was no sound in it except the occasion click or catch of it machineri  for through some caus or other no soul insid it could think of a word to say  the ladi symbol her feel  whatev they were  by urg the machin faster and faster until scatter woodland went by them in one black blotch and heavi hill and valley seem to rippl under the wheel like mere wave  a littl while afterward this mood seem to slacken and she fell into a more ordinari pace  but still she did not speak  turnbul  who kept a more common and sensibl view of the case than anyon els  made some remark about the moonlight  but someth indescrib made him also relaps into silenc  all this time macian had been in a sort of monstrous delirium  like some fabul hero snatch up into the moon  the differ between this experi and common experi was analog to that between wake life and a dream  yet he did not feel in the least as if he were dream  rather the other way  as wake was more actual than dream  so this seem by anoth degre more actual than wake itself  but it was anoth life altogeth  like a cosmos with a new dimens  he felt he had been hurl into some new incarn  into the midst of new relat  wrong and right  with tower respons and almost tragic joy which he had as yet had no time to examin  heaven had not mere sent him a messag  heaven itself had open around him and given him an hour of it own ancient and star  shatter energi  he had never felt so much aliv befor  and yet he was like a man in a tranc  and if you had ask him on what his throb happi hung  he could onli have told you that it hung on four or five visibl fact  as a curtain hang on four of five fix nail  the fact that the ladi had a littl fur at her throat  the fact that the curv of her cheek was a low and lean curv and that the moonlight caught the height of her cheek  bone  the fact that her hand were small but heavili glove as they grip the steer  wheel  the fact that a white witch light was on the road  the fact that the brisk breez of their passag stir and flutter a littl not onli the brown hair of her head but the black fur on her cap  all these fact were to him certain and incred  like sacrament  when they had driven half a mile farther  a big shadow was flung across the path  follow by it bulki owner  who eye the car critic but let it pass  the silver moonlight pick out a piec or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform  and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of polic  three hundr yard farther on anoth policeman step out into the road as if to stop them  then seem to doubt his own author and step back again  the girl was a daughter of the rich  and this polic suspicion  under which all the poor live day and night  stung her for the first time into speech   what can they mean  she cri out in a kind of temper   this car  s go like a snail  there was a short silenc  and then turnbul said   it is certain veri odd  you are drive quiet enough   you are drive nobli  said macian  and his word  which had no mean whatev  sound hoars and ungain even in his own ear  they pass the next mile and a half swift and smooth  yet among the mani thing which they pass in the cours of it was a clump of eager policemen stand at a cross  road  as they pass  one of the policemen shout someth to the other  but noth els happen  eight hundr yard farther on  turnbul stood up sudden in the sway car   my god  macian  he call out  show his first emot of that night   i don  t believ it  s the pace  it couldn  t be the pace  i believ it  s us  macian sat motionless for a few moment and then turn up at his companion a face that was as white as the moon abov it   you may be right  he said at last   if you are  i must tell her   i will tell the ladi if you like  said turnbul  with his unconqu good temper   you  said macian  with a sort of sincer and instinct astonish   whi should you  no  i must tell her  of cours  and he leant forward and spoke to the ladi in the fur cap   i am afraid  madam  that we may have got you into some troubl  he said  and even as he said it it sound wrong  like everyth he said to this particular person in the long glove   the fact is  he resum  desper   the fact is  we are be chase by the polic  then the last flatten hammer fell upon poor evan  s embarrass  for the fluffi brown head with the furri black cap did not turn by a section of the compass   we are chase by the polic  repeat macian  vigor  then he ad  as if begin an explan   you see  i am a cathol  the wind whip back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessit a new theori of aesthet touch the line of the cheek  bone  but the head did not turn   you see  began macian  again blunder   this gentleman wrote in his newspap that our ladi was a common woman  a bad woman  and so we agre to fight  and we were fight quit a littl time ago  but that was befor we saw you  the young ladi drive her car had half turn her face to listen  and it was not a rever or a patient face that she show him  her norman nose was tilt a trifl too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and bodi  when macian saw that arrog and uplift profil pencil plain against the moonshin  he accept an ultim defeat  he had expect the angel to despis him if he were wrong  but not to despis him so much as this   you see  said the stumbl spokesman   i was angri with him when he insult the mother of god  and i ask him to fight a duel with me  but the polic are all tri to stop it  noth seem to waver or flicker in the fair young falcon profil  and it onli open it lip to say  after a silenc   i thought peopl in our time were suppos to respect each other  s religion  under the shadow of that arrog face macian could onli fall back on the obvious answer   but what about a man  s irreligion  the face onli answer   well  you ought to be more broadmind  if anyon els in the world had said the word  macian would have snort with his equin neigh of scorn  but in this case he seem knock down by a superior simplic  as if his eccentr attitud were rebuk by the innoc of a child  he could not dissoci anyth that this woman said or did or wore from an idea of spiritu rariti and virtu  like most other under the same element passion  his soul was at present soak in ethic  he could have appli moral term to the materi object of her environ  if someon had spoken of  her generous ribbon  or  her chivalr glove  or  her merci shoe  buckl  it would not have seem to him nonsens  he was silent  and the girl went on in a lower key as if she were momentarili soften and a littl sadden also   it won  t do  you know  she said   you can  t find out the truth in that way  there are such heap of church and peopl think differ thing nowaday  and they all think they are right  my uncl was a swedenborgian  macian sat with bow head  listen hungrili to her voic but hard to her word  and see his great world drama grow smaller and smaller befor his eye till it was no bigger than a child  s toy theatr   the time  s gone by for all that  she went on   you can  t find out the real thing like that  if there is realli anyth to find  and she sigh rather drearili  for  like mani of the women of our wealthi class  she was old and broken in thought  though young and clean enough in her emot   our object  said turnbul  short   is to make an effect demonstr  and after that word  macian look at his vision again and found it smaller than ever   it would be in the newspap  of cours  said the girl   peopl read the newspap  but they don  t believ them  or anyth els  i think  and she sigh again  she drove in silenc a third of a mile befor she ad  as if complet the sentenc   anyhow  the whole thing  s quit absurd   i don  t think  began turnbul   that you quit realiz  hullo  hullo  hullo  what  s this  the amateur chauffeur had been forc to bring the car to a stagger stoppag  for a file of fat  blue policemen made a wall across the way  a sergeant came to the side and touch his peak cap to the ladi   beg your pardon  miss  he said with some embarrass  for he knew her for a daughter of a domin hous   but we have reason to believ that the gentlemen in your car are  and he hesit for a polit phrase   i am evan macian  said that gentleman  and stood up in a sort of gloomi pomp  not wholli without a touch of the sulk of a schoolboy   yes  we will get out  sergeant  said turnbul  more easili   my name is jame turnbul  we must not incommod the ladi   what are you take them up for  ask the young woman  look straight in front of her along the road   it  s under the new act  said the sergeant  almost apologet   incur disturb of the peac   what will happen to them  she ask  with the same frigid clear   westgat adult reformatori  he repli  briefli   until when   until they are cure  said the offici   veri well  sergeant  said the young ladi  with a sort of tire common sens   i am sure i don  t want to protect crimin or go against the law  but i must tell you that these gentlemen have done me a consider servic  you won  t mind draw your men a littl farther off while i say good night to them  men like that alway misunderstand  the sergeant was profound disquiet from the begin at the mere idea of arrest anyon in the compani of a great ladi  to refus one of her minor request was quit beyond his courag  the polic fell back to a few yard behind the car  turnbul took up the two sword that were their onli luggag  the sword that  after so mani half duel  they were now to surrend at last  macian  the blood thunder in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewel  bent over  fumbl at the handl and flung open the door to get out  but he did not get out  he did not get out  becaus it is danger to jump out of a car when it is go at full speed  and the car was go at full speed  becaus the young ladi  without turn her head or so much as say a syllabl  had driven down a handl that made the machin plung forward like a buffalo and then fli over the landscap like a greyhound  the polic made one rush to follow  and then drop so grotesqu and hopeless a chase  away in the vanish distanc they could see the sergeant furious make note  the open door  still left loos on it hing  swung and bang quit crazili as they went whizz up one road and down anoth  nor did macian sit down  he stood up stun and yet stare  as he would have stood up at the trumpet of the last day  a black dot in the distanc sprang up a tall black forest  swallow them and spat them out again at the other end  a railway bridg grew larger and larger till it leapt upon their back bellow  and was in it turn left behind  avenu of poplar on both side of the road chase each other like the figur in a zoetrop  now and then with a shock and rattl they went through sleep moonlit villag  which must have stir an instant in their sleep as at the pass of a fugit earthquak  sometim in an out hous a light in one errat  unexpect window would give them a nameless hint of the hundr human secret which they left behind them with their dust  sometim even a slouch rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them  as after a fli phantom  but still macian stood up stare at earth and heaven  and still the door he had flung open flap loos like a flag  turnbul  after a few minut of dumb amaz  had yield to the healthiest element in his natur and gone off into uncontrol fit of laughter  the girl had not stir an inch  after anoth half mile that seem a mere flash  turnbul leant over and lock the door  evan stagger at last into his seat and hid his throb head in his hand  and still the car flew on and it driver sat inflex and silent  the moon had alreadi gone down  and the whole dark was faint troubl with twilight and the first movement of beast and fowl  it was that mysteri moment when light is come as if it were someth unknown whose natur one could not guess  a mere alter in everyth  they look at the sky and it seem as dark as ever  then they saw the black shape of a tower or tree against it and knew that it was alreadi grey  save that they were drive southward and had certain pass the longitud of london  they knew noth of their direct  but turnbul  who had spent a year on the hampshir coast in his youth  began to recogn the unmistak but quit indescrib villag of the english south  then a white witch fire began to burn between the black stem of the fir  tree  and  like so mani thing in natur  though not in book on evolut  the daybreak  when it did come  came much quicker than one would think  the gloomi heaven were rip up and roll away like a scroll  reveal splendour  as the car went roar up the curv of a great hill  and abov them and black against the broaden light  there stood one of those crouch and fantast tree that are first signal of the sea  x  the sword rejoin as they came over the hill and down on the other side of it  it is not too much to say that the whole univers of god open over them and under them  like a thing unfold to five time it size  almost under their feet open the enorm sea  at the bottom of a steep valley which fell down into a bay  and the sea under their feet blaze at them almost as lustrous and almost as empti as the sky  the sunris open abov them like some cosmic explos  shine and shatter and yet silent  as if the world were blown to piec without a sound  round the ray of the victori sun swept a sort of rainbow of confus and conquer colour  brown and blue and green and flame rose  colour  as though gold were drive befor it all the colour of the world  the line of the landscap down which they sped  were the simpl  strict  yet swerv  line of a rush river  so that it was almost as if they were be suck down in a huge still whirlpool  turnbul had some such feel  for he spoke for the first time for mani hour   if we go down at this rate we shall be over the sea cliff  he said   how glorious  said macian  when  howev  they had come into the wide hollow at the bottom of that landslid  the car took a calm and grace curv along the side of the sea  melt into the fring of a few tree  and quiet  yet astonish  stop  a belat light was burn in the broad morn in the window of a sort of lodg  or gate  keeper  cottag  and the girl stood up in the car and turn her splendid face to the sun  evan seem startl by the still  like one who had been born amid sound and speed  he waver on his long leg as he stood up  he pull himself togeth  and the onli consequ was that he trembl from head to foot  turnbul had alreadi open the door on his side and jump out  the moment he had done so the strang young woman had one more mad movement  and deliber drove the car a few yard farther  then she got out with an almost cruel cool and began pull off her long glove and almost whistl   you can leav me here  she said  quit casual  as if they had met five minut befor   that is the lodg of my father  s place  pleas come in  if you like  but i understood that you had some busi  evan look at that lift face and found it mere love  he was far too much of a fool to see that it was work with a final fatigu and that it auster was agoni  he was even fool enough to ask it a question   whi did you save us  he said  quit humbl  the girl tore off one of her glove  as if she were tear off her hand   oh  i don  t know  she said  bitter   now i come to think of it  i can  t imagin  evan  s thought  that had been pile up to the

possibl do at the moment  inde  the silenc and the sunris had their heal effect  for when the extraordinari ladi spoke again  her tone was more friend and apologet   i  m not realli ungrat  she said   it was veri good of you to save me from those men   but whi  repeat the obstin and daze macian   whi did you save us from the other men  i mean the policemen  the girl  s great brown eye were lit up with a flash that was at onc final desper and the loosen of some privat and passion reserv   oh  god know  she cri   god know that if there is a god he has turn his big back on everyth  god know i have had no pleasur in my life  though i am pretti and young and father has plenti of money  and then peopl come and tell me that i ought to do thing and i do them and it  s all drivel  they want you to do work among the poor  which mean read ruskin and feel self  righteous in the best room in a poor tenement  or to help some caus or other  which alway mean bundl peopl out of crook hous  in which they  ve alway live  into straight hous  in which they often die  and all the time you have insid onli the horrid ironi of your own empti head and empti heart  i am to give to the unfortun  when my whole misfortun is that i have noth to give  i am to teach  when i believ noth at all that i was taught  i am to save the children from death  and i am not even certain that i should not be better dead  i suppos if i actual saw a child drown i should save it  but that would be from the same motiv from which i have save you  or destroy you  whichev it is that i have done   what was the motiv  ask evan  in a low voic   my motiv is too big for my mind  answer the girl  then  after a paus  as she stare with a rise colour at the glitter sea  she said   it can  t be describ  and yet i am tri to describ it  it seem to me not onli that i am unhappi  but that there is no way of be happi  father is not happi  though he is a member of parliament  she paus a moment and ad with a ghost of a smile   nor aunt mabel  though a man from india has told her the secret of all creed  but i may be wrong  there may be a way out  and for one stark  insan second  i felt that  after all  you had got the way out and that was whi the world hate you  you see  if there were a way out  it would be sure to be someth that look veri queer  evan put his hand to his forehead and began stumbl   yes  i suppos we do seem   oh  yes  you look queer enough  she said  with ring sincer   you  ll be all the better for a wash and brush up   you forget our busi  madam  said evan  in a shake voic   we have no concern but to kill each other   well  i shouldn  t be kill look like that if i were you  she repli  with inhuman honesti  evan stood and roll his eye in masculin bewilder  then came the final chang in this proteus  and she put out both her hand for an instant and said in a low tone on which he live for day and night   don  t you understand that i did not dare to stop you  what you are do is so mad that it may be quit true  somehow one can never realli manag to be an atheist  turnbul stood stare at the sea  but his shoulder show that he heard  and after one minut he turn his head  but the girl had onli brush evan  s hand with her and had fled up the dark alley by the lodg gate  evan stood root upon the road  liter like some heavi statu hewn there in the age of the druid  it seem imposs that he should ever move  turnbul grew restless with this rigid  and at last  after call his companion twice or thrice  went up and clap him impati on one of his big shoulder  evan winc and leapt away from him with a repuls which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a danger one  but was a spasm of awe and separ from someth from which he was now sunder as by the sword of god  he did not hate the atheist  it is possibl that he love him  but turnbul was now someth more dread than an enemi  he was a thing seal and devot  a thing now hopeless doom to be either a corps or an execution   what is the matter with you  ask turnbul  with his hearti hand still in the air  and yet he knew more about it than his innoc action would allow   jame  said evan  speak like one under strong bodili pain   i ask for god  s answer and i have got it  got it in my vital  he know how weak i am  and that i might forget the peril of the faith  forget the face of our ladi  yes  even with your blow upon her cheek  but the honour of this earth has just this about it  that it can make a man  s heart like iron  i am from the lord of the isl and i dare not be a mere desert  therefor  god has tie me by the chain of my world place and word  and there is noth but fight now   i think i understand you  said turnbul   but you say everyth tail foremost   she want us to do it  said evan  in a voic crush with passion   she has hurt herself so that we might do it  she has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habit and digniti flung away on the other side of england in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven   i thought i knew what you mean  said turnbul  bite his beard   it doe seem as if we ought to do someth after all she has done this night   i never like you so much befor  said macian  in bitter sorrow  as he spoke  three solemn footmen came out of the lodg gate and assembl to assist the chauffeur to his room  the mere sight of them made the two wander flee as from a too fright incongru  and befor they knew where they were  they were well upon the grassi ledg of england that overlook the channel  evan said sudden   will they let me see her in heaven onc in a thousand age  and address the remark to the editor of the atheist  as on which he would be like or qualifi to answer  but no answer came  a silenc sank between the two  turnbul strode sturdili to the edg of the cliff and look out  his companion follow  somewhat more shaken by his recent agit   if that  s the view you take  said turnbul   and i don  t say you are wrong  i think i know where we shall be best off for the busi  as it happen  i know this part of the south coast pretti well  and unless i am mistaken there  s a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is like to follow us  the highland made a gestur of assent and came also almost to the edg of the precipic  the sunris  which was broaden over sea and shore  was one of those rare and splendid one in which there seem to be no mist or doubt  and noth but a univers clarif more and more complet  all the colour were transpar  it seem like a triumphant propheci of some perfect world where everyth be innoc will be intellig  a world where even our bodi  so to speak  may be as of burn glass  such a world is faint though fierc figur in the colour window of christian architectur  the sea that lay befor them was like a pavement of emerald  bright and almost brittl  the sky against which it strict horizon hung was almost absolut white  except that close to the sky line  like scarlet braid on the hem of a garment  lay string of flaki cloud of so gleam and gorgeous a red that they seem cut out of some strang blood  red celesti metal  of which the mere gold of this earth is but a drab yellow imit   the hand of heaven is still point  mutter the man of superstit to himself   and now it is a blood  red hand  the cool voic of his companion cut in upon his monologu  call to him from a littl farther along the cliff  to tell him that he had found the ladder of descent  it began as a steep and somewhat greasi path  which then tumbl down twenti or thirti feet in the form of a fall of rough stone step  after that  there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledg of stone and then the journey was undertaken easili and even eleg by the remain of an ornament staircas  such as might have belong to some long  disus water  place  all the time that the two travel sank from stage to stage of this downward journey  there close over their head live bridg and cavern of the most vari foliag  all of which grew greener  redder  or more golden  in the grow sunlight of the morn  life  too  of the more move sort rose at the sun on everi side of them  bird whir and flutter in the undergrowth  as if imprison in green cage  other bird were shaken up in great cloud from the tree  top  as if they were blossom detach and scatter up to heaven  anim which turnbul was too much of a london and macian too much of a northern to know  slip by among the tangl or ran patter up the tree  trunk  both the men  accord to their sever creed  felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it befor  macian felt god the father  benign in all his energi  and turnbul that ultim anonym energi  that natura naturans  which is the whole theme of lucretius  it was down this clamor ladder of life that they went down to die  they broke out upon a brown semicircl of sand  so free from human imprint as to justifi turnbul  s profess  they strode out upon it  stuck their sword in the sand  and had a paus too import for speech  turnbul eye the coast curious for a moment  like one awaken memori of childhood  then he said abrupt  like a man rememb somebodi  s name   but  of cours  we shall be better off still round the corner of crag point  nobodi ever come there at all  and pick up his sword again  he began stride toward a big bluff of the rock which stood out upon their left  macian follow him round the corner and found himself in what was certain an even finer fenc court  of flat  firm sand  enclos on three side by white wall of rock  and on the fourth by the green wall of the advanc sea   we are quit safe here  said turnbul  and  to the other  s surpris  flung himself down  sit on the brown beach   you see  i was brought up near here  he explain   i was sent from scotland to stop with my aunt  it is high probabl that i may die here  do you mind if i light a pipe   of cours  do whatev you like  said macian  with a choke voic  and he went and walk alon by himself along the wet  glisten sand  ten minut afterward he came back again  white with his own whirlwind of emot  turnbul was quit cheer and was knock out the end of his pipe   you see  we have to do it  said macian   she tie us to it   of cours  my dear fellow  said the other  and leapt up as light as a monkey  they took their place grave in the veri centr of the great squar of sand  as if they had thousand of spectat  befor salut  macian  who  be a mystic  was one inch nearer to natur  cast his eye round the huge framework of their heroic folli  the three wall of rock all leant a littl outward  though at various angl  but this impress was exagger in the direct of the incred by the heavi load of live tree and thicket which each wall wore on it top like a huge shock of hair  on all that luxuri crest of life the risen and victori sun was beat  burnish it all like gold  and everi bird that rose with that sunris caught a light like a star upon it like the dove of the holi spirit  imagin life had never so much crowd upon macian  he felt that he could write whole book about the feel of a singl bird  he felt that for two centuri he would not tire of be a rabbit  he was in the palac of life  of which the veri tapestri and curtain were aliv  then he recov himself  and rememb his affair  both men salut  and iron rang upon iron  it was exact at the same moment that he realiz that his enemi  s left ankl was encircl with a ring of salt water that had crept up to his feet   what is the matter  said turnbul  stop an instant  for he had grown use to everi movement of his extraordinari fellow  travel  s face  macian glanc again at that silver anklet of sea  water and then look beyond at the next promontori round which a deep sea was boil and leap  then he turn and look back and saw heavi foam be shaken up to heaven about the base of crag point   the sea has cut us off  he said  curt   i have notic it  said turnbul with equal sobrieti   what view do you take of the develop  evan threw away his weapon  and  as his custom was  imprison his big head in his hand  then he let them fall and said   yes  i know what it mean  and i think it is the fairest thing  it is the finger of god  red as blood  still point  but now it point to two grave  there was a space fill with the sound of the sea  and then macian spoke again in a voic pathet reason   you see  we both save her  and she told us both to fight  and it would not be just that either should fail and fall alon  while the other   you mean  said turnbul  in a voic surpris soft and gentl   that there is someth fine about fight in a place where even the conqueror must die   oh  you have got it right  you have got it right  cri out evan  in an extraordinari childish ecstasi   oh  i  m sure that you realli believ in god  turnbul answer not a word  but onli took up his fallen sword  for the third time evan macian look at those three side of english cliff hung with their noisi load of life  he had been at a loss to understand the almost iron magnific of all those teem creatur and tropic colour and smell that smoke happili to heaven  but now he knew that he was in the close court of death and that all the gate were seal  he drank in the last green and the last red and the last gold  those uniqu and indescrib thing of god  as a man drain good wine at the bottom of his glass  then he turn and salut his enemi onc more  and the two stood up and fought till the foam flow over their knee  then macian step backward sudden with a splash and held up his hand   turnbul  he cri   i can  t help it  fair fight is more even than promis  and this is not fair fight   what the deuc do you mean  ask the other  stare   i  ve onli just thought of it  cri evan  broken   we  re veri well match  it may go on a good time  the tide is come up fast  and i  m a foot and a half taller  you  ll be wash away like seawe befor it  s abov my breech  i  ll not fight foul for all the girl and angel in the univers   will you oblig me  said turnbul  with stare grey eye and a voic of distinct and violent polit   will you oblig me by jolli well mind your own busi  just you stand up and fight  and we  ll see who will be wash away like seawe  you want to finish this fight and you shall finish it  or i  ll denounc you as a coward to the whole of that assembl compani  evan look veri doubt and offer a somewhat waver weapon  but he was quick brought back to his sens by his oppon  s sword  point  which shot past him  shave his shoulder by a hair  by this time the wave were well up turnbul  s thigh  and what was wors  they were begin to roll and break heavili around them  macian parri this first lung perfect  the next less perfect  the third in all human probabl he would not have parri at all  the christian champion would have been pin like a butterfli  and the atheist champion left to drown like a rat  with such consol as his view of the cosmos afford him  but just as turnbul launch his heaviest stroke  the sea  in which he stood up to his hip  launch a yet heavier one  a wave break beyond the other smote him heavili like a hammer of water  one leg gave way  he was swung round and suck into the retreat sea  still grip his sword  macian put his sword between his teeth and plung after his disappear enemi  he had the sens of have the whole univers on top of him as crest after crest struck him down  it seem to him quit a cosmic collaps  as if all the seven heaven were fall on him one after the other  but he got hold of the atheist  s left leg and he did not let it go  after some ten minut of foam and frenzi  in which all the sens at onc seem blast by the sea  evan found himself labori swim on a low  green swell  with the sword still in his teeth and the editor of the atheist still under his arm  what he was go to do he had not even the most glimmer idea  so he mere kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand  he duck instinct as there bulk abov him a big  black wave  much higher than ani that he had seen  then he saw that it was hard the shape of ani possibl wave  then he saw that it was a fisherman  s boat  and  leap upward  caught hold of the bow  the boat pitch forward with it stern in the air for just as much time as was need to see that there was nobodi in it  after a moment or two of desper clamber  howev  there were two peopl in it  mr  evan macian  pant and sweat  and mr  jame turnbul  uncommon close to be drown  after ten minut  aimless toss in the empti fish  boat he recov  howev  stir  stretch himself  and look round on the roll water  then  while take no notic of the stream of salt water that were pour from his hair  beard  coat  boot  and trouser  he care wipe the wet off his sword  blade to preserv it from the possibl of rust  macian found two oar in the bottom of the desert boat and began somewhat drearili to row     a raini twilight was clear to cold silver over the moan sea  when the batter boat that had roll and drift almost aimless all night  came within sight of land  though of land which look almost as lost and savag as the wave  all night there had been but littl lift in the leaden sea  onli now and then the boat had been heav up  as on a huge shoulder which slip from under it  such occasion sea  quak came probabl from the swell of some steamer that had pass it in the dark  otherwis the wave were harmless though restless  but it was pierc cold  and there was  from time to time  a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray  which seem almost to freez as it fell  macian  more at home than his companion in this quit barbar and element sort of adventur  had row toilsom with the heavi oar whenev he saw anyth that look like land  but for the most part had trust with grim transcendent to wind and tide  among the implement of their first outfit the brandi alon had remain to him  and he gave it to his freez companion in quantiti which great alarm that temper london  but macian came from the cold sea and mist where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whiski in a boat without it make him wink  when the highland began to pull realli hard upon the oar  turnbul crane his drip red head out of the boat to see the goal of his exert  it was a suffici uninvit one  noth so far as could be seen but a steep and shelv bank of shingl  made of loos littl pebbl such as children like  but slant up higher than a hous  on the top of the mound  against the sky line  stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fenc or breakwat  with the grey and wateri dawn crawl up behind it  the fenc realli seem to say to our philosoph adventur that they had come at last to the other end of nowher  bent by necess to his labour  macian manag the heavi boat with real power and skill  and when at length he ran it up on a smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could clamber out  not sink farther than their knee into the water and the shingl  a foot or two farther up their feet found the beach firmer  and a few moment afterward they were lean on the rag breakwat and look back at the sea they had escap  they had a dreari walk across wast of grey shingl in the grey dawn befor they began to come within hail of human field or road  nor had they ani notion of what field or road they would be  their boot were begin to break up and the confus of stone tri them sever  so that they were glad to lean on their sword  as if they were the stave of pilgrim  macian thought vagu of a weird ballad of his own countri which describ the soul in purgatori as walk on a plain full of sharp stone  and onli save by it own chariti upon earth  if ever thou gavest hosen and shoon everi night and all  sit thee down and put them on  and christ receiv thi soul  turnbul had no such lyric medit  but he was in an even wors temper  at length they came to a pale ribbon of road  edg by a shelf of rough and almost colourless turf  and a few feet up the slope there stood grey and weather  stain  one of those big waysid crucifix which are seldom seen except in cathol countri  macian put his hand to his head and found that his bonnet was not there  turnbul gave one glanc at the crucifix  a glanc at onc sympathet and bitter  in which was concentr the whole of swinburn  s poem on the same occas  o hidden face of man  whereov the year have woven a viewless veil  if thou wert verili man  s lover what did thi love or blood avail  thi blood the priest mix poison of  and in gold shekel coin thi love  then  leav macian in his attitud of prayer  turnbul began to look right and left veri sharpli  like one look for someth  sudden  with a littl cri  he saw it and ran forward  a few yard from them along the road a lean and starv sort of hedg came piti to an end  caught upon it prick angl  howev  there was a veri small and veri dirti scrap of paper that might have hung there for month  sinc it escap from someon tear up a letter or make a spill out of a newspap  turnbul snatch at it and found it was the corner of a print page  veri coars print  like a cheap novelett  and just larg enough to contain the word   et c  est ell qui   hurrah  cri turnbul  wave his fragment   we are safe at last  we are free at last  we are somewher better than england or eden or paradis  macian  we are in the land of the duel   where do you say  said the other  look at him heavili and with knit brow  like one almost daze with the grey doubt of desol twilight and drift sea   we are in franc  cri turnbul  with a voic like a trumpet   in the land where thing realli happen  tout arriv en france  we arriv in franc  look at this littl messag  and he held out the scrap of paper   there  s an omen for you superstiti hill folk  c  est ell qui  mai oui  mai oui  c  est ell qui sauvera encor le monde   franc  repeat macian  and his eye awok again in his head like larg lamp light   yes  franc  said turnbul  and all the rhetor part of him came to the top  his face grow as red as his hair   franc  that has alway been in rebellion for liberti and reason  franc  that has alway assail superstit with the club of rabelai or the rapier of voltair  franc  at whose first council tabl sit the sublim figur of julian the apost  franc  where a man said onli the other day those splendid unanswer word  with a superb gestur  we have extinguish in heaven those light that men shall never light again   no  said macian  in a voic that shook with a control passion   but franc  which was taught by st  bernard and led to war by joan of arc  franc that made the crusad  franc that save the church and scatter the heresi by the mouth of bossuet and massillon  franc  which show today the conquer march of catholic  as brain after brain surrend to it  brunetièr  coppé  hauptmann  barrè  bourget  lemaîtr   franc  assert turnbul with a sort of rollick self  exagger  veri unusu with him   franc  which is one torrent of splendid sceptic from abelard to anatol franc   franc  said macian   which is one cataract of clear faith from st  loui to our ladi of lourd   franc at least  cri turnbul  throw up his sword in schoolboy triumph   in which these thing are thought about and fought about  franc  where reason and religion clash in one continu tournament  franc  abov all  where men understand the pride and passion which have pluck our blade from their scabbard  here  at least  we shall not be chase and spi on by sick parson and greasi policemen  becaus we wish to put our live on the game  courag  my friend  we have come to the countri of honour  macian did not even notic the incongru phrase  my friend  but nod again and again  drew his sword and flung the scabbard far behind him in the road   yes  he cri  in a voic of thunder   we will fight here and he shall look on at it  turnbul glanc at the crucifix with a sort of scowl good  humour and then said   he may look and see his cross defeat   the cross cannot be defeat  said macian   for it is defeat  a second afterward the two bright  blood  thirsti weapon made the sign of the cross in horribl parodi upon each other  they had not touch each other twice  howev  when upon the hill  abov the crucifix  there appear anoth horribl parodi of it shape  the figur of a man who appear for an instant wave his outspread arm  he had vanish in an instant  but macian  whose fight face was set that way  had seen the shape momentarili but quit photograph  and while it was like a comic repetit of the cross  it was also  in that place and hour  someth more incred  it had been onli instantan on the retina of his eye  but unless his eye and mind were go mad togeth  the figur was that of an ordinari london policeman  he tri to concentr his sens on the sword  play  but one half of his brain was wrestl with the puzzl  the apocalypt and almost seraph apparit of a stout constabl out of clapham on top of a dreari and desert hill in franc  he did not  howev  have to puzzl long  befor the duellist had exchang half a dozen pass  the big  blue policeman appear onc more on the top of the hill  a palpabl monstros in the eye of heaven  he was wave onli one arm now and seem to be shout direct  at the same moment a mass of blue block the corner of the road behind the small  smart figur of turnbul  and a small compani of policemen in the english uniform came up at a kind of half  militari doubl  turnbul saw the stare of constern in his enemi  s face and swung round to share it caus  when he saw it  cool as he was  he stagger back   what the devil are you do here  he call out in a high  shrill voic of author  like one who find a tramp in his own larder   well  sir  said the sergeant in command  with that sort of heavi civil shown onli to the evid guilti   seem to me we might ask what are you do here   we are have an affair of honour  said turnbul  as if it were the most ration thing in the world   if the french polic like to interfer  let them interfer  but whi the blue blaze should you interfer  you great blue blunder sausag   i  m afraid  sir  said the sergeant with restraint   i  m afraid i don  t quit follow you   i mean  whi don  t the french polic take this up if it  s got to be taken up  i alway heard that they were spri enough in their own way   well  sir  said the sergeant reflect   you see  sir  the french polic don  t take this up  well  becaus you see  sir  this ain  t franc  this is his majesti  s dominion  same as  ampstead  eath   not franc  repeat turnbul  with a sort of dull incredul   no  sir  said the sergeant   though most of the peopl talk french  this is the island call st  loup  sir  an island in the channel  we  ve been sent down special from london  as you were such special distinguish crimin  if you  ll allow me to say so  which remind me to warn you that anyth you say may be use against you at your trial   quit so  said turnbul  and lurch sudden against the sergeant  so as to tip him over the edg of the road with a crash into the shingl below  then leav macian and the policemen equal and instantan nail to the road  he ran a littl way along it  leapt off on to a part of the beach  which he had found in his journey to be firmer  and went across it with a clatter of pebbl  his sudden calcul was success  the polic  unacquaint with the various level of the loos beach  tri to overtak him by the shorter cut and found themselv  be heavi men  almost up to their knee in shoal of slipperi shingl  two who had been slower with their bodi were quicker with their mind  and see turnbul  s trick  ran along the edg of the road after him  then macian final awok  and leav half his sleev in the grip of the onli man who tri to hold him  took the two policemen in the small of their back with the impetus of a cannon  ball and  send them also flat among the stone  went tear after his twin defier of the law  as they were both good runner  the start they had gain was decis  they drop over a high breakwat farther on upon the beach  turn sharpli  and scrambl up a line of rib rock  crown with a thicket  crawl through it  scratch their hand and face  and drop into anoth road  and there found that they could slacken their speed into a steadi trot  in all this desper dart and scrambl  they still kept hold of their drawn sword  which now  inde  in the vigor phrase of bunyan  seem almost to grow out of their hand  they had run anoth half mile or so when it becam appar that they were enter a sort of scatter villag  one or two whitewash cottag and even a shop had appear along the side of the road  then  for the first time  turnbul twist round his red bear to get a glimps of his companion  who was a foot or two behind  and remark abrupt   mr  macian  we  ve been go the wrong way to work all along  we  re trace everywher  becaus everybodi know about us  it  s as if one went about with kruger  s beard on mafek night   what do you mean  said macian  innoc   i mean  said turnbul  with steadi convict   that what we want is a littl diplomaci  and i am go to buy some in a shop  xi  a scandal in the villag in the littl hamlet of haroc  in the isl of st  loup  there live a man who  though live under the english flag  was absolut untyp of the french tradit  he was quit unnotic  but that was exact where he was quit himself  he was not even extraordinarili french  but then it is against the french tradit to be extraordinarili french  ordinari englishmen would onli have thought him a littl old  fashion  imperialist englishmen would realli have mistaken him for the old john bull of the caricatur  he was stout  he was quit undistinguish  and he had side  whisker  worn just a littl longer than john bull  s  he was by name pierr durand  he was by trade a wine merchant  he was by polit a conserv republican  he had been brought up a cathol  had alway thought and act as an agnost  and was veri mild return to the church in his later year  he had a genius  if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person  a genius for say the convent thing on everi conceiv subject  or rather what we in england would call the convent thing  for it was not convent with him  but solid and man convict  convent impli cant or affect  and he had not the faintest smell of either  he was simpli an ordinari citizen with ordinari view  and if you had told him so he would have taken it as an ordinari compliment  if you had ask him about women  he would have said that one must preserv their domest and decorum  he would have use the stalest word  but he would have in reserv the strongest argument  if you had ask him about govern  he would have said that all citizen were free and equal  but he would have meant what he said  if you had ask him about educ  he would have said that the young must be train up in habit of industri and of respect for their parent  still he would have set them the exampl of industri  and he would have been one of the parent whom they could respect  a state of mind so hopeless central is depress to the english instinct  but then in england a man announc these platitud is general a fool and a frighten fool  announc them out of mere social servil  but durand was anyth but a fool  he had read all the eighteenth centuri  and could have defend his platitud round everi angl of eighteenth  centuri argument  and certain he was anyth but a coward  swollen and sedentari as he was  he could have hit ani man back who touch him with the instant violenc of an automat machin  and die in a uniform would have seem to him onli the sort of thing that sometim happen  i am afraid it is imposs to explain this monster amid the exagg sect and the eccentr club of my countri  he was mere a man  he live in a littl villa which was furnish well with comfort chair and tabl and high uncomfort classic pictur and medallion  the art in his home contain noth between the two extrem of hard  meagr design of greek head and roman toga  and on the other side a few veri vulgar cathol imag in the crudest colour  these were most in his daughter  s room  he had recent lost his wife  whom he had love heartili and rather heavili in complet silenc  and upon whose grave he was constant in the habit of place hideous littl wreath  made out of a sort of black  and  white bead  to his onli daughter he was equal devot  though he restrict her a good deal under a sort of theoret alarm about her innoc  an alarm which was peculiar unnecessari  first  becaus she was an except retic and religi girl  and second  becaus there was hard anybodi els in the place  madelein durand was physic a sleepi young woman  and might easili have been suppos to be moral a lazi one  it is  howev  certain that the work of her hous was done somehow  and it is even more rapid ascertain that nobodi els did it  the logician is  therefor  driven back upon the assumpt that she did it  and that lend a sort of mysteri interest to her person at the begin  she had veri broad  low  and level brow  which seem even lower becaus her warm yellow hair cluster down to her eyebrow  and she had a face just plump enough not to look as power as it was  anyth that was heavi in all this was abrupt lighten by two larg  light china  blue eye  lighten all of a sudden as if it had been lift into the air by two big blue butterfli  the rest of her was less than middl  size  and was of a casual and comfort sort  and she had this differ from such girl as the girl in the motor  car  that one did not inclin to take in her figur at all  but onli her broad and leonin and innoc head  both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normal have avoid all observ  that is  all observ in that extraordinari modern world which call out everyth except strength  both of them had strength below the surfac  they were like quiet peasant own enorm and unquarri mine  the father with his squar face and grey side whisker  the daughter with her squar face and golden fring of hair  were both stronger than they know  stronger than anyon knew  the father believ in civil  in the stori tower we have erect to affront natur  that is  the father believ in man  the daughter believ in god  and was even stronger  they neither of them believ in themselv  for that is a decad weak  the daughter was call a devote  she left upon ordinari peopl the impress  the somewhat irrit impress  produc by such a person  it can onli be describ as the sens of strong water be perpetu pour into some abyss  she did her housework easili  she achiev her social relat sweet  she was never neglect and never unkind  this account for all that was soft in her  but not for all that was hard  she trod firm as if go somewher  she flung her face back as if defi someth  she hard spoke a cross word  yet there was often battl in her eye  the modern man ask doubt where all this silent energi went to  he would have stare still more doubt if he had been told that it all went into her prayer  the convent of the isl of st  loup were necessarili a compromis or confus between those of franc and england  and it was vagu possibl for a respect young ladi to have half  attach lover  in a way that would be imposs to the bourgeoisie of franc  one man in particular had made himself an unmistak figur in the track of this girl as she went to church  he was a short  prosper  look man  whose long  bushi black beard and clumsi black umbrella made him seem both shorter and older than he realli was  but whose big  bold eye  and step that spurn the ground  gave him an instant charact of youth  his name was camill bert  and he was a commerci travel who had onli been in the island an idl week befor he began to hover in the track of madelein durand  sinc everyon know everyon in so small a place  madelein certain knew him to speak to  but it is not veri evid that she ever spoke  he haunt her  howev  especi at church  which was  inde  one of the few certain place for find her  in her home she had a habit of be invis  sometim through insati domest  sometim through an equal insati solitud  m  bert did not give the impress of a pious man  though he did give  especi with his eye  the impress of an honest one  but he went to mass with a simpl exactitud that could not be mistaken for a pose  or even for a vulgar fascin  it was perhap this religi regular which eventu drew madelein into recognit of him  at least it is certain that she twice spoke to him with her squar and open smile in the porch of the church  and there was human natur enough in the hamlet to turn even that into gossip  but the real interest aros sudden as a squall aris with the extraordinari affair that occur about five day after  there was about a third of a mile beyond the villag of haroc a larg but lone hotel upon the london or pari model  but common almost entir empti  among the accident group of guest who had come to it at this season was a man whose nation no one could fix and who bore the non  committ name of count gregori  he treat everybodi with complet civil and almost in complet silenc  on the few occas when he spoke  he spoke either french  english  or onc  to the priest  latin  and the general opinion was that he spoke them all wrong  he was a larg  lean man  with the stoop of an age eagl  and even the eagl  s nose to complet it  he had old  fashion militari whisker and moustach dy with a garish and high incred yellow  he had the dress of a showi gentleman and the manner of a decay gentleman  he seem  as with a sort of simplic  to be tri to be a dandi when he was too old even to know that he was old  ye he was decid a handsom figur with his curl yellow hair and lean fastidi face  and he wore a peculiar frock  coat of bright turquois blue  with an unknown order pin to it  and he carri a huge and heavi cane  despit his silenc and his dandifi dress and whisker  the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinari event of which i have spoken  which fell about in the follow way  in such casual atmospher onli the enthusiast go to benedict  and as the warm blue twilight close over the littl candl  lit church and villag  the line of worshipp who went home from the former to the latter thin out until it broke  on one such even at least no one was in church except the quiet  unconquer madelein  four old women  one fisherman  and  of cours  the irrepress m  camill bert  the other seem to melt away afterward into the peacock colour of the dim green grass and the dark blue sky  even durand was invis instead of be mere reverenti remot  and madelein set forth through the patch of black forest alon  she was not in the least afraid of loneli  becaus she was not afraid of devil  i think they were afraid of her  in a clear of the wood  howev  which was lit up with a last patch of the perish sunlight  there advanc upon her sudden one who was more startl than a devil  the incomprehens count gregori  with his yellow hair like flame and his face like the white ash of the flame  was advanc barehead toward her  fling out his arm and his long finger with a frantic gestur   we are alon here  he cri   and you would be at my merci  onli that i am at your  then his frantic hand fell by his side and he look up under his brow with an express that went well with his hard breath  madelein durand had come to a halt at first in childish wonder  and now  with more than masculin self  control   i fanci i know your face  sir  she said  as if to gain time   i know i shall not forget your  said the other  and extend onc more his ungain arm in an unnatur gestur  then of a sudden there came out of him a spout of wild and yet pompous phrase   it is as well that you should know the worst and the best  i am a man who know no limit  i am the most callous of crimin  the most unrepent of sinner  there is no man in my dominion so vile as i  but my dominion stretch from the oliv of itali to the fir  wood of denmark  and there is no nook of all of them in which i have not done a sin  but when i bear you away i shall be do my first sacrileg  and also my first act of virtu  he seiz her sudden by the elbow  and she did not scream but onli pull and tug  yet though she had not scream  someon astray in the wood seem to have heard the struggl  a short but nimbl figur came along the woodland path like a hum bullet and had caught count gregori a crack across the face befor his own could be recogn  when it was recogn it was that of camill  with the black elder beard and the young ardent eye  up to the moment when camill had hit the count  madelein had entertain no doubt that the count was mere a madman  now she was startl with a new saniti  for the tall man in the yellow whisker and yellow moustach first return the blow of bert  as if it were a sort of duti  and then step back with a slight bow and an easi smile   this need go no further here  m  bert  he said   i need not remind you how far it should go elsewher   certain  you need remind me of noth  answer camill  stolid   i am glad that you are just not too much of a scoundrel for a gentleman to fight   we are detain the ladi  said count gregori  with polit  and  make a gestur suggest that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one  he strode away up the avenu of tree and eventu disappear  he was so complet an aristocrat that he could offer his back to them all the way up that avenu  and his back never onc look uncomfort   you must allow me to see you home  said bert to the girl  in a gruff and almost stifl voic   i think we have onli a littl way to go   onli a littl way  she said  and smile onc more that night  in spite of fatigu and fear and the world and the flesh and the devil  the glow and transpar blue of twilight had long been cover by the opaqu and slatelik blue of night  when he hand her into the lamp  lit interior of her home  he went out himself into the dark  walk sturdili  but tear at his black beard  all the french or semi  french gentri of the district consid this a case in which a duel was natur and inevit  and neither parti had ani difficulti in find second  stranger as they were in the place  two small landown  who were care  practis cathol  will undertook to repres that strict church  goer camill burt  while the proflig but appar power count gregori found friend in an energet local doctor who was readi for social promot and an accident californian tourist who was readi for anyth  as no particular purpos could be serv by delay  it was arrang that the affair should fall out three day afterward  and when this was settl the whole communiti  as it were  turn over again in bed and thought no more about the matter  at least there was onli one member of it who seem to be restless  and that was she who was common most rest  on the next night madelein durand went to church as usual  and as usual the stricken camill was there also  what was not so usual was that when they were a bow  shot from the church madelein turn round and walk back to him   sir  she began   it is not wrong of me to speak to you  and the veri word gave him a jar of unexpect truth  for in all the novel he had ever read she would have begun   it is wrong of me to speak to you  she went on with wide and serious eye like an anim  s   it is not wrong of me to speak to you  becaus your soul  or anybodi  s soul  matter so much more than what the world say about anybodi  i want to talk to you about what you are go to do  bert saw in front of him the inevit heroin of the novel tri to prevent bloodsh  and his pale firm face becam implac   i would do anyth but that for you  he said   but no man can be call less than a man  she look at him for a moment with a face open puzzl  and then broke into an odd and beauti half  smile   oh  i don  t mean that  she said   i don  t talk about what i don  t understand  no one has ever hit me  and if they had i should not feel as a man may  i am sure it is not the best thing to fight  it would be better to forgiv  if one could realli forgiv  but when peopl dine with my father and say that fight a duel is mere murder  of cours i can see that is not just  it  s all so differ  have a reason  and let the other man know  and use the same gun and thing  and do it in front of your friend  i  m aw stupid  but i know that men like you aren  t murder  but it wasn  t that that i meant   what did you mean  ask the other  look brood at the earth   don  t you know  she said   there is onli one more celebr  i thought that as you alway go to church  i thought you would communic this morn  bert step backward with a sort of action she had never seen in him befor  it seem to alter his whole bodi   you may be right or wrong to risk die  said the girl  simpli   the poor women in our villag risk it whenev they have a babi  you men are the other half of the world  i know noth about when you ought to die  but sure if you are dare to tri and find god beyond the grave and appeal to him  you ought to let him find you when he come and stand there everi morn in our littl church  and placid as she was  she made a littl gestur of argument  of which the patho wrung the heart  m  camill bert was by no mean placid  befor that incomplet gestur and frank plead face he retreat as if from the jaw of a dragon  his dark black hair and beard look utter unnatur against the startl pallor of his face  when at last he said someth it was   o god  i can  t stand this  he did not say it in french  nor did he  strict speak  say it in english  the truth  interest onli to anthropologist  is that he said it in scotch   there will be anoth mass in a matter of eight hour  said madelein  with a sort of busi eager and energi   and you can do it then befor the fight  you must forgiv me  but i was so frighten that you would not do it at all  bert seem to crush his teeth togeth until they broke  and manag to say between them   and whi should you suppos that i shouldn  t do as you say  i mean not to do it at all   you alway go to mass  answer the girl  open her wide blue eye   and the mass is veri long and tiresom unless one love god  then it was that bert explod with a brutal which might have come from count gregori  his crimin oppon  he advanc upon madelein with flame eye  and almost took her by the two shoulder   i do not love god  he cri  speak french with the broadest scotch accent   i do not want to find him  i do not think he is there to be found  i must burst up the show  i must and will say everyth  you are the happiest and honestest thing i ever saw in this godless univers  and i am the dirtiest and most dishonest  madelein look at him doubt for an instant  and then said with a sudden simplic and cheer   oh  but if you are realli sorri it is all right  if you are horribl sorri it is all the better  you have onli to go and tell the priest so and he will give you god out of his own hand   i hate your priest and i deni your god  cri the man   and i tell you god is a lie and a fabl and a mask  and for the first time in my life i do not feel superior to god   what can it all mean  said madelein  in massiv wonder   becaus i am a fabl also and a mask  said the man  he had been pluck fierc at his black beard and hair all the time  now he sudden pluck them off and flung them like moult feather in the mire  this extraordinari spoliat left in the sunlight the same face  but a much younger head  a head with close chestnut curl and a short chestnut beard   now you know the truth  he answer  with hard eye   i am a cad who has play a crook trick on a quiet villag and a decent woman for a privat reason of his own  i might have play it success on ani other woman  i have hit the one woman on whom it cannot be play  it  s just like my damn luck  the plain truth is  and here when he came to the plain truth he boggl and blunder as evan had done in tell it to the girl in the motor  car   the plain truth is  he said at last   that i am jame turnbul the atheist  the polic are after me  not for atheism but for be readi to fight for it   i saw someth about you in a newspap  said the girl  with a simplic which even surpris could never throw off it balanc   evan macian said there was a god  went on the other  stubborn   and i say there isn  t  and i have come to fight for the fact that there is no god  it is for that that i have seen this curs island and your bless face   you want me realli to believ  said madelein  with part lip   that you think   i want you to hate me  cri turnbul  in agoni   i want you to be sick when you think of my name  i am sure there is no god   but there is  said madelein  quit quiet  and rather with the air of one tell children about an eleph   whi  i touch his bodi onli this morn   you touch a bit of bread  said turnbul  bite his knuckl   oh  i will say anyth that can madden you   you think it is onli a bit of bread  said the girl  and her lip tighten ever so littl   i know it is onli a bit of bread  said turnbul  with violenc  she flung back her open face and smile   then whi did you refus to eat it  she said  jame turnbul made a littl step backward  and for the first time in his life there seem to break out and blaze in his head thought that were not his own   whi  how silli of them  cri out madelein  with quit a schoolgirl gaieti   whi  how silli of them to call you a blasphem  whi  you have wreck your whole busi becaus you would not commit blasphemi  the man stood  a somewhat comic figur in his tragic bewilder  with the honest red head of jame turnbul stick out of the rich and fictiti garment of camill bert  but the startl pain of his face was strong enough to obliter the odditi   you come down here  continu the ladi  with that femal emphasi which is so pulver in convers and so feebl at a public meet   you and your macian come down here and put on fals beard or nose in order to fight  you pretend to be a cathol commerci travel from franc  poor mr  macian has to pretend to be a dissolut nobleman from nowher  your scheme succeed  you pick a quit convinc quarrel  you arrang a quit respect duel  the duel you have plan so long will come off tomorrow with absolut certainti and safeti  and then you throw off your wig and throw up your scheme and throw over your colleagu  becaus i ask you to go into a build and eat a bit of bread  and then you dare to tell me that you are sure there is noth watch us  then you say you know there is noth on the veri altar you run away from  you know   i onli know  said turnbul   that i must run away from you  this has got beyond ani talk  and he plung along into the villag  leav his black wig and beard lie behind him on the road  as the market  place open befor him he saw count gregori  that distinguish foreign  stand and smoke in eleg medit at the corner of the local café  he immedi made his way rapid toward him  consid that a consult was urgent  but he had hard cross half of that stoni quadrangl when a window burst open abov him and a head was thrust out  shout  the man was in his woollen undershirt  but turnbul knew the energet  apologet head of the sergeant of polic  he point furious at turnbul and shout his name  a policeman ran excit from under an archway and tri to collar him  two men sell veget drop their basket and join in the chase  turnbul dodg the constabl  upset one of the men into his own basket  and bound toward the distinguish foreign count  call to him clamor   come on  macian  the hunt is up again  the prompt repli of count gregori was to pull off his larg yellow whisker and scatter them on the breez with an air of consider relief  then he join the flight of turnbul  and even as he did so  with one wrench of his power hand rent and split the strang  thick stick that he carri  insid it was a nake old  fashion rapier  the two got a good start up the road befor the whole town was awaken behind them  and half  way up it a similar transform was seen to take place in mr  turnbul  s singular umbrella  the two had a long race for the harbour  but the english polic were heavi and the french inhabit were indiffer  in ani case  they got use to the notion of the road be clear  and just as they had come to the cliff macian bang into anoth gentleman with unmistak surpris  how he knew he was anoth gentleman mere by bang into him  must remain a mysteri  macian was a veri poor and veri sober scotch gentleman  the other was a veri drunk and veri wealthi english gentleman  but there was someth in the stagger and open embarrass apolog that made them understand each other as readili and as quick and as much as two men talk french in the middl of china  the nearest express of the type is that it either hit or apolog  and in this case both apolog   you seem to be in a hurri  said the unknown englishman  fall back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatur hearti   what  s it all about  eh  then befor macian could get past his sprawl and stagger figur he ran forward again and said with a sort of shout and ear  shatter whisper   i say  my name is wilkinson  you know  wilkinson  s entir was my grandfath  can  t drink beer myself  liver  and he shook his head with extraordinari sagac   we realli are in a hurri  as you say  said macian  summon a suffici pleasant smile   so if you will let us pass   i  ll tell you what  you fellow  said the sprawl gentleman  confidenti  while evan  s agon ear heard behind him the first pace of the pursuit   if you realli are  as you say  in a hurri  i know what it is to be in a hurri  lord  what a hurri i was in when we all came out of cartwright  s room  if you realli are in a hurri  and he seem to steadi his voic into a sort of solemn  if you are in a hurri  there  s noth like a good yacht for a man in a hurri   no doubt you  re right  said macian  and dash past him in despair  the head of the pursu host was just show over the top of the hill behind him  turnbul had alreadi duck under the intox gentleman  s elbow and fled far in front   no  but look here  said mr  wilkinson  enthusiast run after macian and catch him by the sleev of his coat   if you want to hurri you should take a yacht  and if  he said  with a burst of ration  like one leap to a further point in logic  if you want a yacht  you can have mine  evan pull up abrupt and look back at him   we are realli in the devil of a hurri  he said   and if you realli have a yacht  the truth is that we would give our ear for it   you  ll find it in harbour  said wilkinson  struggl with his speech   left side of harbour  call gibson girl  can  t think whi  old fellow  i never lent it you befor  with these word the benevol mr  wilkinson fell flat on his face in the road  but continu to laugh soft  and turn toward his fli companion a face of peculiar peac and benign  evan  s mind went through a crisi of instantan casuistri  in which it may be that he decid wrong  but about how he decid his biograph can profess no doubt  two minut afterward he had overtaken turnbul and told the tale  ten minut afterward he and turnbul had somehow tumbl into the yacht call the gibson girl and had somehow push off from the isl of st  loup  xii  the desert island those who happen to hold the view  and mr  evan macian  now aliv and comfort  is among the number  that someth supernatur  some eccentr kind from god or fairi had guid our adventur through all their absurd peril  might have found his strongest argument perhap in their manag or mismanag of mr  wilkinson  s yacht  neither of them had the smallest qualif for manag such a vessel  but macian had a practic knowledg of the sea in much smaller and quit differ boat  while turnbul had an abstract knowledg of scienc and some of it applic to navig  which was wors  the presenc of the god or fairi can onli be deduc from the fact that they never definit ran into anyth  either a boat  a rock  a quicksand  or a man  of  war  apart from this negat descript  their voyag would be difficult to describ  it took at least a fortnight  and macian  who was certain the shrewder sailor of the two  realiz that they were sail west into the atlant and were probabl by this time past the scilli isl  how much farther they stood out into the western sea it was imposs to conjectur  but they felt certain  at least  that they were far enough into that aw gulf between us and america to make it unlik that they would soon see land again  it was therefor with legitim excit that one raini morn after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitari island stand up against the encircl strip of silver which ran round the skylin and separ the grey and green of the billow from the grey and mauv of the morn cloud   what can it be  cri macian  in a dri  throat excit   i didn  t know there were ani atlant island so far beyond the scilli  good lord  it can  t be madeira  yet   i thought you were fond of legend and lie and fabl  said turnbul  grim   perhap it  s atlanti   of cours  it might be  answer the other  quit innoc and grave   but i never thought the stori about atlanti was veri solid establish   whatev it is  we are run on to it  said turnbul  equabl   and we shall be shipwreck twice  at ani rate  the nake  look nose of land project from the unknown island was  inde  grow larger and larger  like the trunk of some terribl and advanc eleph  there seem to be noth in particular  at least on this side of the island  except shoal of shellfish lie so thick as almost to make it look like one of those toy grotto that the children make  in one place  howev  the coast offer a soft  smooth bay of sand  and even the rudimentari ingenu of the two amateur marin manag to run up the littl ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit point upward  as in a sort of idiot triumph  they tumbl on shore and began to unload the vessel  set the store out in row upon the sand with someth of the solemn of boy play at pirat  there were mr  wilkinson  s cigar  box and mr  wilkinson  s dozen of champagn and mr  wilkinson  s tin salmon and mr  wilkinson  s tin tongu and mr  wilkinson  s tin sardin  and everi sort of preserv thing that could be seen at the armi and navi store  then macian stop with a jar of pickl in his hand and said abrupt   i don  t know whi we  re do all this  i suppos we ought realli to fall to and get it over  then he ad more thought   of cours this island seem rather bare and the survivor   the question is  said turnbul  with cheer specul   whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for pot prawn  macian look down at the row of tin and bottl  and the cloud of doubt still lower upon his face   you will permit me two liberti  my dear sir  said turnbul at last   the first is to break open this box and light one of mr  wilkinson  s excel cigar  which will  i am sure  assist my medit  the second is to offer a penni for your thought  or rather to convuls the alreadi complex financ of this island by bet a penni that i know them   what on earth are you talk about  ask macian  listless  in the manner of an inattent child   i know what you are realli think  macian  repeat turnbul  laugh   i know what i am think  anyhow  and i rather fanci it  s the same   what are you think  ask evan   i am think and you are think  said turnbul   that it is damn silli to wast all that champagn  someth like the spectr of a smile appear on the unsmil visag of the gael  and he made at least no movement of dissent   we could drink all the wine and smoke all the cigar easili in a week  said turnbul   and that would be to die feast like hero   yes  and there is someth els  said macian  with slight hesit   you see  we are on an almost unknown rock  lost in the atlant  the polic will never catch us  but then neither may the public ever hear of us  and that was one of the thing we want  then  after a paus  he said  draw in the sand with his sword  point   she may never hear of it at all   well  inquir the other  puf at his cigar   well  said macian   we might occupi a day or two in draw up a thorough and complet statement of what we did and whi we did it  and all about both our point of view  then we could leav one copi on the island whatev happen to us and put anoth in an empti bottl and send it out to sea  as they do in the book   a good idea  said turnbul   and now let us finish unpack  as macian  a tall  almost ghost figur  pace along the edg of sand that ran round the islet  the purpl but cloudi poetri which was his nativ element was pile up at it thickest upon his soul  the uniqu island and the endless sea emphas the thing sole as an epic  there were no ladi or policemen here to give him a hint either of it farc or it tragedi   perhap when the morn star were made  he said to himself   god built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatr for the fight between yea and nay  then he wander up to the highest level of the rock  where there was a roof or plateau of level stone  half an hour afterward  turnbul found him clear away the loos sand from this tabl  land and make it smooth and even   we will fight up here  turnbul  said macian   when the time come  and till the time come this place shall be sacr   i thought of have lunch up here  said turnbul  who had a bottl of champagn in his hand   no  no  not up here  said macian  and came down from the height quit hastili  befor he descend  howev  he fix the two sword upright  one at each end of the platform  as if they were human sentinel to guard it under the star  then they came down and lunch plenti in a nest of loos rock  in the same place that night they sup more plenti still  the smoke of mr  wilkinson  s cigar went up ceaseless and strong smell  like a pagan sacrific  the golden glori of mr  wilkinson  s champagn rose to their head and pour out of them in fanci and philosophi  and occasion they would look up at the starlight and the rock and see the space guard by the two cross  hilt sword  which look like two black cross at either end of a grave  in this primit and homer truce the week pass by  it consist almost entir of eat  drink  smoke  talk  and occasion sing  they wrote their record and cast loos their bottl  they never ascend to the omin plateau  they had never stood there save for that singl embarrass minut when they had had no time to take stock of the seascap or the shape of the land  they did not even explor the island  for macian was part concern in prayer and turnbul entir concern with tobacco  and both these form of inspir can be enjoy by the seclud and even the sedentari  it was on a golden afternoon  the sun sink over the sea  ray like the veri head of apollo  when turnbul toss off the last half  pint from the empti wilkinsonian bottl  hurl the bottl into the sea with objectless energi  and went up to where his sword stood wait for him on the hill  macian was alreadi stand heavili by his with bent head and eye read the ground  he had not even troubl to throw a glanc round the island or the horizon  but turnbul be of a more activ and birdlik type of mind did throw a glanc round the scene  the consequ of which was that he near fell off the rock  on three side of this shelli and sandi islet the sea stretch blue and infinit without a speck of land or sail  the same as turnbul had first seen it  except that the tide be out it show a few yard more of slant sand under the root of the rock  but on the fourth side the island exhibit a more extraordinari featur  in fact  it exhibit the extraordinari featur of not be an island at all  a long  curv neck of sand  as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent  ran out into the sea and join their rock to a line of low  billow  and glisten sand  hill  which the sink sea had just bare to the sun  whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess  but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edg of some larger land  for colourless hill appear faint behind them and no sea could be seen beyond   sake aliv  cri turnbul  with roll eye   this ain  t an island in the atlant  we  ve but the balli contin of america  macian turn his head  and his face  alreadi pale  grew a shade paler  he was by this time walk in a world of omen and hieroglyph  and he could not read anyth but what was baffl or menac in this brown gigant arm of the earth stretch out into the sea to seiz him   macian  said turnbul  in his temper way   whatev our etern interrupt tete  a  tete have taught us or not taught us  at least we need not fear the charg of fear  if it is essenti to your emot  i will cheer finish the fight here and now  but i must confess that if you kill me here i shall die with my curios high excit and unsatisfi upon a minor point of geographi   i do not want to stop now  said the other  in his elephantin simplic   but we must stop for a moment  becaus it is a sign  perhap it is a miracl  we must see what is at the end of the road of sand  it may be a bridg built across the gulf by god   so long as you gratifi my queri  said turnbul  laugh and let back his blade into the sheath   i do not care for what reason you choos to stop  they clamber down the rocki peninsula and trudg along the sandi isthmus with the plod resolut of men who seem almost to have made up their mind to be wander on the face of the earth  despit turnbul  s air of scientif eager  he was realli the less impati of the two  and the highland went on well ahead of him with passion stride  by the time they had walk for about half an hour in the up and down of those dreari sand  the distanc between the two had lengthen and macian was onli a tall figur silhouet for an instant upon the crest of some sand  dune and then disappear behind it  this rather increas the robinson cruso feel in mr  turnbul  and he look about almost disconsol for some sign of life  what sort of life he expect it to be if it appear  he did not veri clear know  he has sinc confess that he think that in his subconsci he expect an allig  the first sign of life that he did see  howev  was someth more extraordinari than the largest allig  it was noth less than the notori mr  evan macian come bound back across the sand  heap breathless  without his cap and keep the sword in his hand onli by a habit now quit harden   take care  turnbul  he cri out from a good distanc as he ran   i  ve seen a nativ   a nativ  repeat his companion  whose sceneri had of late been chiefli of shellfish   what the deuc  do you mean an oyster   no  said macian  stop and breath hard   i mean a savag  a black man   whi  where did you see him  ask the stare editor   over there  behind that hill  said the gasp macian   he put up his black head and grin at me  turnbul thrust his hand through his red hair like one who give up the world as a bad riddl   lord love a duck  said he   can it be jamaica  then glanc at his companion with a small frown  as of one slight suspici  he said   i say  don  t think me rude  but you  re a visionari kind of fellow  and then we drank a great deal  do you mind wait here while i go and see for myself   shout if you get into troubl  said the celt  with composur   you will find it as i say  turnbul ran off ahead with a rapid now far greater than his rival  s  and soon vanish over the disput sand  hill  then five minut pass  and then seven minut  and macian bit his lip and swung his sword  and the other did not reappear  final  with a gaelic oath  evan start forward to the rescu  and almost at the same moment the small figur of the miss man appear on the ridg against the sky  even at that distanc  howev  there was someth odd about his attitud  so odd that macian continu to make his way in that direct  it look as if he were wound  or  still more  as if he were ill  he waver as he came down the slope and seem fling himself into peculiar postur  but it was onli when he came within three feet of macian  s face  that that observ of mankind fulli realiz that mr  jame turnbul was roar with laughter   you are quit right  sob that wholli demor journalist   he  s black  oh  there  s no doubt the black  s all right  as far as it goe  and he went off again into convuls of his humor ailment   what ever is the matter with you  ask macian  with stern impati   did you see the nigger   i saw the nigger  gasp turnbul   i saw the splendid barbarian chief  i saw the emperor of ethiopia  oh  i saw him all right  the nigger  s hand and face are a love colour  and the nigger  and he was overtaken onc more   well  well  well  said evan  stamp each monosyl on the sand   what about the nigger   well  the truth is  said turnbul  sudden and startl  becom quit grave and precis   the truth is  the nigger is a margat nigger  and we are now on the edg of the isl of thanet  a few mile from margat  then he had a momentari return of his hysteria and said   i say  old boy  i should like to see a chart of our fortnight  s cruis in wilkinson  s yacht  macian had no smile in answer  but his eager lip open as if parch for the truth   you mean to say  he began   yes  i mean to say  said turnbul   and i mean to say someth funnier still  i have learnt everyth i want to know from the partial black musician over there  who has taken a run in his war  paint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coast  the nobl savag has told me all about it  the bottl contain our declar  doctrin  and die sentiment was wash up on margat beach yesterday in the presenc of one alderman  two bath  machin men  three policemen  seven doctor  and a hundr and thirteen london clerk on a holiday  to all of whom  whether direct or indirect  our composit gave enorm literari pleasur  buck up  old man  this stori of our is a switchback  i have begun to understand the puls and the time of it  now we are up in a cathedr and then we are down in a theatr  where they onli play farc  come  i am quit reconcil  let us enjoy the farc  but macian said noth  and an instant afterward turnbul himself call out in an entir chang voic   oh  this is damnabl  this is not to be born  macian follow his eye along the sand  hill  he saw what look like the momentari and wave figur of the nigger minstrel  and then he saw a heavi run policeman take the turn of the sand  hill with the smooth solemn of a railway train  xiii  the garden of peac up to this instant evan macian had realli understood noth  but when he saw the policeman he saw everyth  he saw his enemi  all the power and princ of the earth  he sudden alter from a stare statu to a leap man of the mountain   we must break away from him here  he cri  briefli  and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridg in a straight line and at a particular angl  when the policeman had finish his admir railway curv  he found a wall of fail sand between him and the pursu  by the time he had scale it thrice  slid down twice  and crest it in the third effort  the two fli figur were far in front  they found the sand harder farther on  it began to be crust with scrap of turf and in a few moment they were fli easili over an open common of rank sea  grass  they had no easi busi  howev  for the bottl which they had so innoc sent into the chief gate of thanet had call to life the polic of half a counti on their trail  from everi side across the grey  green common figur could be seen run and close in  and it was onli when macian with his big bodi broke down the tangl barrier of a littl wood  as men break down a door with the shoulder  it was onli when they vanish crash into the underworld of the black wood  that their hunter were even instantan thrown off the scent  at the risk of struggl a littl longer like fli in that black web of twig and trunk  evan  who had an instinct of the hunter or the hunt  took an incalcul cours through the forest  which let them out at last by a forest open  quit forgotten by the leader of the chase  they ran a mile or two farther along the edg of the wood until they reach anoth and somewhat similar open  then macian stood utter still and listen  as anim listen  for everi sound in the univers  then he said   we are quit of them  and turnbul said   where shall we go now  macian look at the silver sunset that was close in  bar by plumi line of purpl cloud  he look at the high tree  top that caught the last light and at the bird go heavili homeward  just as if all these thing were bit of written advic that he could read  then he said   the best place we can go to is to bed  if we can get some sleep in this wood  now everyon has clear out of it  it will be worth a handicap of two hundr yard tomorrow  turnbul  who was except live and laugh in his demeanour  kick his leg about like a schoolboy and said he did not want to go to sleep  he walk incess and talk veri brilliant  and when at last he lay down on the hard earth  sleep struck him senseless like a hammer  inde  he need the strongest sleep he could get  for the earth was still full of dark and a kind of morn fog when his fellow  fugit shook him awak   no more sleep  i  m afraid  said evan  in a heavi  almost submiss  voic of apolog   they  ve gone on past us right enough for a good thirti mile  but now they  ve found out their mistak  and they  re come back   are you sure  said turnbul  sit up and rub his red eyebrow with his hand  the next moment  howev  he had jump up aliv and leap like a man struck with a shock of cold water  and he was plung after macian along the woodland path  the shape of their old friend the constabl had appear against the pearl and pink of the sunris  somehow  it alway look a veri funni shape when seen against the sunris     a wash of weari daylight was break over the countri  side  and the field and road were full of white mist  the kind of white mist that cling in corner like cotton wool  the empti road  along which the chase had taken it turn  was overshadow on one side by a veri high discolour wall  stain  and streak green  as with seawe  evid the high  shoulder sentinel of some great gentleman  s estat  a yard or two from the wall ran parallel to it a link and tangl line of lime  tree  form a kind of cloister along the side of the road  it was under this branch colonnad that the two fugit fled  almost conceal from their pursuer by the twilight  the mist and the leap zoetrop of shadow  their feet  though beat the ground furious  made but a faint nois  for they had kick away their boot in the wood  their long  antiqu weapon made no jingl or clatter  for they had strap them across their back like guitar  they had all the advantag that invis and silenc can add to speed  a hundr and fifti yard behind them down the centr of the empti road the first of their pursuer came pound and pant  a fat but power policeman who had distanc all the rest  he came on at a splendid pace for so port a figur  but  like all heavi bodi in motion  he gave the impress that it would be easier for him to increas his pace than to slacken it sudden  noth short of a brick wall could have abrupt brought him up  turnbul turn his head slight and found breath to say someth to macian  macian nod  pursuer and pursu were fix in their distanc as they fled  for some quarter of a mile  when they came to a place where two or three of the tree grew twist togeth  make a special obscur  past this place the pursu policeman went thunder without thought or hesit  but he was pursu his shadow or the wind  for turnbul had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quick and soft as a cat  somewhat more labori but in equal silenc the long leg of the highland had follow  and crouch in crucial silenc in the cloud of leav  they saw the whole poss of their pursuer go by and die into the dust and mist of the distanc  the white vapour lay  as it often doe  in lean and palpabl layer  and even the head of the tree was abov it in the half  daylight  like a green ship swing on a sea of foam  but higher yet behind them  and readier to catch the first come of the sun  ran the rampart of the top of the wall  which in their excit of escap look at onc indispens and unattain  like the wall of heaven  here  howev  it was macian  s turn to have the advantag  for  though less light  limb and felin  he was longer and stronger in the arm  in two second he had tug up his chin over the wall like a horizont bar  the next he sat astrid of it  like a hors of stone  with his assist turnbul vault to the same perch  and the two began cautious to shift along the wall in the direct by which they had come  doubl on their track to throw off the last pursuit  macian could not rid himself of the fanci of bestrid a steed  the long  grey cope of the wall shot out in front of him  like the long  grey neck of some nightmar rosinant  he had the quaint thought that he and turnbul were two knight on one steed on the old shield of the templar  the nightmar of the stone hors was increas by the white fog  which seem thicker insid the wall than outsid  they could make noth of the enclosur upon which they were partial trespass  except that the green and crook branch of a big appl  tree came crawl at them out of the mist  like the tentacl of some green cuttlefish  anyth would serv  howev  that was like to confus their trail  so they both decid without need of word to use this tree also as a ladder  a ladder of descent  when they drop from the lowest branch to the ground their stocking feet felt hard gravel beneath them  they had alight in the middl of a veri broad garden path  and the clear mist permit them to see the edg of a well  clip lawn  though the white vapour was still a veil  it was like the gauzi veil of a transform scene in a pantomim  for through it there glow shapeless mass of colour  mass which might be cloud of sunris or mosaic of gold and crimson  or ladi robe in rubi and emerald draperi  as it thin yet farther they saw that it was onli flower  but flower in such insol mass and magnific as can seldom be seen out of the tropic  purpl and crimson rhododendron rose arrog  like rampant herald anim against their burn background of laburnum gold  the rose were red hot  the clemati was  so to speak  blue hot  and yet the mere white of the syringa seem the most violent colour of all  as the golden sunlight gradual conquer the mist  it had realli someth of the sensat sweet of the slow open of the gate of eden  macian  whose mind was alway haunt with such seraph or titan parallel  made some such remark to his companion  but turnbul onli curs and said that it was the back garden of some damnabl rich man  when the last haze had fade from the order path  the open lawn  and the flame flower  bed  the two realiz  not without an abrupt re  examin of their posit  that they were not alon in the garden  down the centr of the central garden path  preced by a blue cloud from a cigarett  was walk a gentleman who evid understood all the relish of a garden in the veri earli morn  he was a slim yet satisfi figur  clad in a suit of pale  grey tweed  so subdu that the pattern was impercept  a costum that was casual but not by ani mean careless  his face  which was reflect and somewhat over  refin  was the face of a quit elder man  though his stringi hair and moustach were still quit yellow  a doubl eye  glass  with a broad  black ribbon  droop from his aquilin nose  and he smile  as he commune with himself  with a self  content which was rare and almost irrit  the straw panama on his head was mani shade shabbier than his cloth  as if he had caught it up by accid  it need the full shock of the huge shadow of macian  fall across his sunlit path  to rous him from his smile reveri  when this had fallen on him he lift his head a littl and blink at the intrud with short  sight benevol  but with far less surpris than might have been expect  he was a gentleman  that is  he had social presenc of mind  whether for kind or for insol   can i do anyth for you  he said  at last  macian bow   you can extend to us your pardon  he said  for he also came of a whole race of gentlemen  of gentlemen without shirt to their back   i am afraid we are trespass  we have just come over the wall   over the wall  repeat the smile old gentleman  still without let his surpris come uppermost   i suppos i am not wrong  sir  continu macian   in suppos that these ground insid the wall belong to you  the man in the panama look at the ground and smoke thought for a few moment  after which he said  with a sort of matur convict   yes  certain  the ground insid the wall realli belong to me  and the ground outsid the wall  too   a larg proprietor  i imagin  said turnbul  with a trucul eye   yes  answer the old gentleman  look at him with a steadi smile   a larg proprietor  turnbul  s eye grew even more offens  and he began bite his red beard  but macian seem to recogn a type with which he could deal and continu quit easili   i am sure that a man like you will not need to be told that one see and doe a good mani thing that do not get into the newspap  thing which  on the whole  had better not get into the newspap  the smile of the larg proprietor broaden for a moment under his loos  light moustach  and the other continu with increas confid   one sometim want to have it out with anoth man  the polic won  t allow it in the street  and then there  s the counti council  and in the field even noth  s allow but poster of pill  but in a gentleman  s garden  now  the strang gentleman smile again and said  easili enough   do you want to fight  what do you want to fight about  macian had understood his man pretti well up to that point  an instinct common to all men with the aristocrat tradit of europ had guid him  he knew that the kind of man who in his own back garden wear good cloth and spoil them with a bad hat is not the kind of man who has an abstract horror of illeg action of violenc or the evas of the polic  but a man may understand rag and yet be veri far from understand religi rag  this seem host of their might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulti at card or even escap from a pursu tailor  but it still remain doubt whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquak instant when the virgin is compar to a goddess of mesopotamia  even macian  therefor  whose tact was far from be his strong point  felt the necess for some compromis in the mode of approach  at last he said  and even then with hesit   we are fight about god  there can be noth so import as that  the tilt eye  glass of the old gentleman fell abrupt from his nose  and he thrust his aristocrat chin so far forward that his lean neck seem to shoot out longer like a telescop   about god  he queri  in a key complet new   look here  cri turnbul  take his turn rough   i  ll tell you what it  s all about  i think that there  s no god  i take it that it  s nobodi  s busi but mine  or god  s  if there is one  this young gentleman from the highland happen to think that it  s his busi  in consequ  he first take a walk  stick and smash my shop  then he take the same walk  stick and tri to smash me  to this i natur object  i suggest that if it come to that we should both have stick  he improv on the suggest and propos that we should both have steel  point stick  the polic  with characterist unreason  will not accept either of our propos  the result is that we run about dodg the polic and have jump over our garden wall into your magnific garden to throw ourselv on your magnific hospit  the face of the old gentleman had grown redder and redder dure this address  but it was still smile  and when he broke out it was with a kind of guffaw   so you realli want to fight with drawn sword in my garden  he ask   about whether there is realli a god   whi not  said macian  with his simpl monstros of speech   all man  s worship began when the garden of eden was found   yes  by  said turnbul  with an oath   and end when the zoolog garden were found   in this garden  in my presenc  cri the stranger  stamp up and down the gravel and choke with laughter  whether there is a god  and he went stamp up and down the garden  make it echo with his unintellig laughter  then he came back to them more compos and wipe his eye   whi  how small the world is  he cri at last   i can settl the whole matter  whi  i am god  and he sudden began to kick and wave his well  clad leg about the lawn   you are what  repeat turnbul  in a tone which is beyond descript   whi  god  of cours  answer the other  thorough amus   how funni it is to think that you have tumbl over a garden wall and fallen exact on the right person  you might have gone flounder about in all sort of church and chapel and colleg and school of philosophi look for some evid of the exist of god  whi  there is no evid  except see him  and now you  ve seen him  you  ve seen him danc  and the oblig old gentleman instant stood on one leg without relax at all the grave and cultur benign of his express   i understood that this garden  began the bewild macian   quit so  quit so  said the man on one leg  nod grave   i said this garden belong to me and the land outsid it  so they do  so doe the countri beyond that and the sea beyond that and all the rest of the earth  so doe the moon  so do the sun and star  and he ad  with a smile of apolog   you see  i  m god  turnbul and macian look at him for one moment with a sort of notion that perhap he was not too old to be mere play the fool  but after stare steadili for an instant turnbul saw the hard and horribl earnest in the man  s eye behind all his empti anim  then turnbul look veri grave at the strict gravel wall and the gay flower  bed and the long rectangular red  brick build  which the mist had left evid beyond them  then he look at macian  almost at the same moment anoth man came walk quick round the regal clump of rhododendron  he had the look of a prosper banker  wore a good tall silk hat  was almost stout enough to burst the button of a fine frock  coat  but he was talk to himself  and one of his elbow had a singular outward jerk as he went by  xiv  a museum of soul the man with the good hat and the jump elbow went by veri quick  yet the man with the bad hat  who thought he was god  overtook him  he ran after him and jump over a bed of geranium to catch him   i beg your majesti  s pardon  he said  with mock humil   but here is a quarrel which you ought realli to judg  then as he led the heavi  silk  hat man back toward the group  he caught macian  s ear in order to whisper   this poor gentleman is mad  he think he is edward vii  at this the self  appoint creator slight wink   of cours you won  t trust him much  come to me for everyth  but in my posit one has to meet so mani peopl  one has to be broadmind  the big banker in the black frock  coat and hat was stand quit grave and dignifi on the lawn  save for his slight twitch of one limb  and he did not

and these two gentlemen can obvious fight in front of us  you  he  he  are the king  i am god  realli  they could hard have better support  they have come to the right place  then turnbul  who had been stare with a frown at the fresh turf  burst out with a rather bitter laugh and cri  throw his red head in the air   yes  by god  macian  i think we have come to the right place  and macian answer  with an adamantin stupid   ani place is the right place where they will let us do it  there was a long still  and their eye involuntarili took in the landscap  as they had taken in all the landscap of their everlast combat  the bright  squar garden behind the shop  the whole lift and lean of the side of hampstead heath  the littl garden of the decad choke with flower  the squar of sand besid the sea at sunris  they both felt at the same moment all the breadth and blossom beauti of that paradis  the colour tree  the natur and rest nook and also the great wall of stone  more aw than the wall of china  from which no flesh could flee  turnbul was moodili balanc his sword in his hand as the other spoke  then he start  for a mouth whisper quit close to his ear  with a soft incred in ani cat  the huge  heavi man in the black hat and frock  coat had crept across the lawn from his own side and was say in his ear   don  t trust that second of your  he  s mad and not so mad  either  for he fright

i expect we  re watch  but  someth in turnbul made him want sudden to be sick on the grass  the mere healthi and heathen horror of the unclean  the mere inhuman hatr of the inhuman state of mad  he seem to hear all round him the hate whisper of that place  innumer as leav whisper in the wind  and each of them tell eager some evil that had not happen or some terrif secret which was not true  all the rationalist and plain man revolt within him against bow down for a moment in that forest of decept and egotist dark  he want to blow up that palac of delus with dynamit  and in some wild way

wearili   protoplasm is not worth go mad about   at least  said turnbul  savag   it was your jesus christ who start all this bosh about be god  for one instant macian open the eye of battl  then his tighten lip took a crook smile and he said  quit calm   no  the idea is older  it was satan who first said that he was god   then  what  ask turnbul  veri slowli  as he soft pick a flower   what is

think he was veri modest  said macian   it is we who are arrog  who know we are onli men  the ordinari man in the street is more of a monster than that poor fellow  for the man in the street treat himself as god almighti when he know he isn  t  he expect the univers to turn round him  though he know he isn  t the centr   well  said turnbul  sit down on the grass   this is a digress  anyhow  what i want to point out is  that your faith doe end in asylum and my scienc doesn  t   doesn  t it  by georg  cri macian  scorn   there are a few men here who are mad on god and a few who are mad on

with all his logic awak   obvious one should not trust ani god that one can improv on   it is the way he talk  said macian  almost indiffer   but he say rummier thing than that  he say that a man  s doctor ought to decid what woman he marri  and he say that children ought not to be brought up by their parent  becaus a physic partial will then distort the judgement of the educ   oh  dear  said turnbul  laugh   you have certain come across a pretti bad case  and incident prove your own  i suppos some men do lose their wit through scienc as through love and other good thing   and he say  went on macian  monoton   that he cannot see whi anyon should suppos that a triangl is a three  side figur  he say that on some higher plane  turnbul leapt to his feet as by an electr shock   i never could

wander about by the nasturtium bed  macian vanish  and in a few moment return  trail with him his own discoveri among lunat  who was a slender man with a fix smile and an unfix and roll head  he had a goatlik beard just long enough to be shaken in a strong wind  turnbul sprang to his feet and was like one who is speechless through choke a sudden shout of laughter   whi  you great donkey  he shout  in an ear  shatter whisper   that  s not one of the patient at all  that  s one of the doctor  evan look back at the leer head with the long  point beard and repeat the word inquir   one of the doctor   oh  you know what i mean  said turnbul  impati   the medic author of the place  evan was still stare back curious at the beam and beard creatur behind him   the mad doctor  said turnbul  short   quit so  said macian  after a rather restless silenc turnbul pluck macian by the elbow and pull him asid   for good sake  he said   don  t offend this fellow  he may be as mad as ten hatter  if you like  but he has us between his finger and thumb  this is the veri time he appoint to talk with us about our  well  our exeat   but what can it matter  ask the wonder macian   he can  t keep us in the asylum  we  re not mad   jackass  said turnbul  heartili   of cours we  re not mad  of cours  if we are medic examin and the thing is thrash out  they will find we are not mad  but don  t you see that if the thing is thrash out it will mean letter to this refer and telegram to that  and at the first word of who we are  we shall be taken out of a madhous  where we may smoke  to a jail  where we mayn  t  no  if we manag this veri quiet  he may mere let us out at the front door as stray revel  if there  s half an hour of inquiri  we are cook  macian look at the grass frown for a few second  and then said in a new  small and childish voic   i am aw stupid  mr  turnbul  you must be patient with me  turnbul caught evan  s elbow again with quit anoth gestur   come  he cri  with the harsh voic of one who hide emot   come and let us be tact in chorus  the doctor with the point beard was alreadi slant it forward at a more than usual acut angl  with the smile that express expect   i hope i do not hurri you  gentlemen  he said  with the faintest suggest of a sneer at their hurri consult   but i believ you want to see me at half past eleven   i am most aw sorri  doctor  said turnbul  with readi amiabl   i never meant to keep you wait  but the silli accid that has land us in your garden may have some rather serious consequ to our friend elsewher  and my friend here was just draw my attent to some of them   quit so  quit so  said the doctor  hurri   if you realli want to put anyth befor me  i can give you a few moment in my consult  room  he led them rapid into a small but impos apart  which seem to be built and furnish entir in red  varnish wood  there was one desk occupi with care docket paper  and there were sever chair of the red  varnish wood  though of differ shape  all along the wall ran someth that might have been a bookcas  onli that it was not fill with book  but with flat  oblong slab or case of the same polish dark  red consist  what those flat wooden case were they could form no concept  the doctor sat down with a polit impati on his profession perch  macian remain stand  but turnbul threw himself almost with luxuri into a hard wooden arm  chair   this is a most absurd busi  doctor  he said   and i am asham to take up the time of busi profession men with such prank from outsid  the plain fact is  that he and i and a pack of silli men and girl have organ a game across this part of the countri  a sort of combin of hare and hound and hide and seek  i dare say you  ve heard of it  we are the hare  and  see your high wall look so invit  we tumbl over it  and natur were a littl startl with what we found on the other side   quit so  said the doctor  mild   i can understand that you were startl  turnbul had expect him to ask what place was the headquart of the new exhilar game  and who were the male and femal enthusiast who had brought it to such perfect  in fact  turnbul was busi make up these person and topograph particular  as the doctor did not ask the question  he grew slight uneasi  and risk the question   i hope you will accept my assur that the thing was an accid and that no intrus was meant   oh  yes  sir  repli the doctor  smile   i accept everyth that you say   in that case  said turnbul  rise genial   we must not further interrupt your import duti  i suppos there will be someon to let us out   no  said the doctor  still smile steadili and pleasant   there will be no one to let you out   can we let ourselv out  then  ask turnbul  in some surpris   whi  of cours not  said the beam scientist   think how danger that would be in a place like this   then  how the devil are we to get out  cri turnbul  lose his manner for the first time   it is a question of time  of recept  and treatment  said the doctor  arch his eyebrow indiffer   i do not regard either of your case as incur  and with that the man of the world was struck dumb  and  as in all intoler moment  the word was with the unworld  macian took one stride to the tabl  leant across it  and said   we can  t stop here  we  re not mad peopl   we don  t use the crude phrase  said the doctor  smile at his patent  leather boot   but you can  t think us mad  thunder macian   you never saw us befor  you know noth about us  you haven  t even examin us  the doctor threw back his head and beard   oh  yes  he said   veri thorough   but you can  t shut a man up on your mere impress without document or certif or anyth  the doctor got languid to his feet   quit so  he said   you certain ought to see the document  he went across to the curious mock book  shelv and took down one of the flat mahogani case  this he open with a curious key at his watch  chain  and lay back a flap reveal a quir of foolscap cover with close but quit clear write  the first three word were in such larg copi  book hand that they caught the eye even at a distanc  they were   macian  evan stuart  evan bent his angri eagl face over it  yet someth blur it and he could never swear he saw it distinct  he saw someth that began   prenat influenc predispos to mania  grandfath believ in return of the stuart  mother carri bone of st  eulalia with which she touch children in sick  mark religi mania at earli age  evan fell back and fought for his speech   oh  he burst out at last   oh  if all this world i have walk in had been as sane as my mother was  then he compress his templ with his hand  as if to crush them  and then lift sudden a face that look fresh and young  as if he had dip and wash it in some holi well   veri well  he cri   i will take the sour with the sweet  i will pay the penalti of have enjoy god in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast  i will die happi in your madhous  onli becaus i know what i know  let it be grant  then  macian is a mystic  macian is a maniac  but this honest shopkeep and editor whom i have drag on my inhuman escapad  you cannot keep him  he will go free  thank god  he is not down in ani damn document  his ancestor  i am certain  did not die at culloden  his mother  i swear  had no relic  let my friend out of your front door  and as for me  the doctor had alreadi gone across to the laden shelv  and after a few minut  short  sight peer  had pull down anoth parallelogram of dark  red wood  this also he unlock on the tabl  and with the same uner egotist eye on of the compani saw the word  written in larg letter   turnbul  jame  hitherto turnbul himself had somewhat scorn surrend his part in the whole busi  but he was too honest and unaffect not to start at his own name  after the name  the inscript appear to run   uniqu case of eleutheromania  parentag  as so often in such case  prosaic and healthi  eleutheromaniac sign occur earli  howev  lead him to attach himself to the individualist bradlaugh  recent outbreak of pure anarchi  turnbul slam the case to  almost smash it  and said with a burst of savag laughter   oh  come along  macian  i don  t care so much  even about get out of the madhous  if onli we get out of this room  you were right enough  macian  when you spoke about  about mad doctor  somehow they found themselv outsid in the cool  green garden  and then  after a stun silenc  turnbul said   there is one thing that was puzzl me all the time  and i understand it now   what do you mean  ask evan   no man by will or wit  answer turnbul   can get out of this garden  and yet we got into it mere by jump over a garden wall  the whole thing explain itself easili enough  that undefend wall was an open trap  it was a trap laid for two celebr lunat  they saw us get in right enough  and they will see that we do not get out  evan gaze at the garden wall  grave for more than a minut  and then he nod without a word  xv  the dream of macian the system of espionag in the asylum was so effect and complet that in practic the patient could often enjoy a sens of almost complet solitud  they could stray up so near to the wall in an appar unwatch garden as to find it easi to jump over it  they would onli have found the error of their calcul if they had tri to jump  under this insult liberti  in this artifici loneli  evan macian was in the habit of creep out into the garden after dark  especi upon moonlight night  the moon  inde  was for him alway a posit magnet in a manner somewhat hard to explain to those of a robust attitud  evid  apollo is to the full as poetic as diana  but it is not a question of poetri in the matur and intellectu sens of the word  it is a question of a certain solid and childish fanci  the sun is in the strict and liter sens invis  that is to say  that by our bodili eye it cannot proper be seen  but the moon is a much simpler thing  a nake and nurseri sort of thing  it hang in the sky quit solid and quit silver and quit useless  it is one huge celesti snowbal  it was at least some such infantil fact and fanci which led evan again and again dure his dehuman imprison to go out as if to shoot the moon  he was out in the garden on one such lumin and ghost night  when the steadi moonshin tone down all the colour of the garden until almost the strongest tint to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the larg lemon moon  he was walk with his face turn up to it in that rather half  wit fashion which might have excus the error of his keeper  and as he gaze he becam awar of someth littl and lustrous fli close to the lustrous orb  like a bright chip knock off the moon  at first he thought it was a mere sparkl or refract in his own eyesight  he blink and clear his eye  then he thought it was a fall star  onli it did not fall  it jerk awkward up and down in a way unknown among meteor and strang reminisc of the work of man  the next moment the thing drove right across the moon  and from be silver upon blue  sudden becam black upon silver  then although it pass the field of light in a flash it outlin was unmistak though eccentr  it was a fli ship  the vessel took one long and sweep curv across the sky and came nearer and nearer to macian  like a steam  engin come round a bend  it was of pure white steel  and in the moon it gleam like the armour of sir galahad  the simil of such virgin is not inappropri  for  as it grew larger and larger and lower and lower  evan saw that the onli figur in it was robe in white from head to foot and crown with snow  white hair  on which the moonshin lay like a benedict  the figur stood so still that he could easili have suppos it to be a statu  inde  he thought it was until it spoke   evan  said the voic  and it spoke with the simpl author of some forgotten father revisit his children   you have remain here long enough  and your sword is want elsewher   want for what  ask the young man  accept the monstrous event with a queer and clumsi natur   what is my sword want for   for all that you hold dear  said the man stand in the moonlight   for the throne of author and for all ancient loyalti to law  evan look up at the lunar orb again as if in irrat appeal  a moon calf bleat to his mother the moon  but the face of luna seem as witless as his own  there is no help in natur against the supernatur  and he look again at the tall marbl figur that might have been made out of solid moonlight  then he said in a loud voic   who are you  and the next moment was seiz by a sort of choke terror lest his question should be answer  but the unknown preserv an impenetr silenc for a long space and then onli answer   i must not say who i am until the end of the world  but i may say what i am  i am the law  and he lift his head so that the moon smote full upon his beauti and ancient face  the face was the face of a greek god grown old  but not grown either weak or ugli  there was noth to break it regular except a rather long chin with a cleft in it  and this rather ad distinct than lessen beauti  his strong  well  open eye were veri brilliant but quit colourless like steel  macian was one of those to whom a rever and self  submiss in ritual come quit easi  and are ordinari thing  it was not artifici in him to bend slight to this solemn apparit or to lower his voic when he said   do you bring me some messag   i do bring you a messag  answer the man of moon and marbl   the king has return  evan did not ask for or requir ani explan   i suppos you can take me to the war  he said  and the silent silver figur onli bow it head again  macian clamber into the silver boat  and it rose upward to the star  to say that it rose to the star is no mere metaphor  for the sky had clear to that occasion and astonish transpar in which one can see plain both star and moon  as the white  robe figur went upward in his white chariot  he said quit quiet to evan   there is an answer to all the folli talk about equal  some star are big and some small  some stand still and some circl around them as they stand  they can be order  but they cannot be equal   they are all veri beauti  said evan  as if in doubt   they are all beauti  answer the other   becaus each is in his place and own his superior  and now england will be beauti after the same fashion  the earth will be as beauti as the heaven  becaus our king have come back to us   the stuart  began evan  earnest   yes  answer the old man   that which has return is stuart and yet older than stuart  it is capet and plantagenet and pendragon  it is all that good old time of which proverb tell  that golden reign of saturn against which god and men were rebel  it is all that was ever lost by insol and overwhelm in rebellion  it is your own forefath  macian with the broken sword  bleed without hope at culloden  it is charl refus to answer the question of the rebel court  it is mari of the magic face confront the gloomi and grasp peer and the boorish moral of knox  it is richard  the last plantagenet  give his crown to bolingbrok as to a common brigand  it is arthur  overwhelm in lyoness by heathen armi and die in the mist  doubt if ever he shall return   but now  said evan  in a low voic   but now  said the old man   he has return   is the war still rage  ask macian   it rage like the pit itself beyond the sea whither i am take you  answer the other   but in england the king enjoy his own again  the peopl are onc more taught and rule as is best  they are happi knight  happi squir  happi servant  happi serf  if you will  but free at last of that load of vexat and lone vaniti which was call be a citizen   is england  inde  so secur  ask evan   look out and see  said the guid   i fanci you have seen this place befor  they were drive through the air toward one region of the sky where the hollow of night seem darkest and which was quit without star  but against this black background there sprang up  pick out in glitter silver  a dome and a cross  it seem that it was realli newli cover with silver  which in the strong moonlight was like white flame  but  howev  cover or paint  evan had no difficult in know the place again  he saw the great thoroughfar that slope upward to the base of it huge pedest of step  and he wonder whether the littl shop was still by the side of it and whether it window had been mend  as the fli ship swept round the dome he observ other alter  the dome had been redecor so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiast note  the ball was drape or destroy  and round the galleri  under the cross  ran what look like a ring of silver statu  like the littl leaden imag that stood round the hat of loui xi  round the second galleri  at the base of the dome  ran a second rank of such imag  and evan thought there was anoth round the step below  when they came closer he saw that they were figur in complet armour of steel or silver  each with a nake sword  point upward  and then he saw one of the sword move  these were not statu but an arm order of chivalri thrown in three circl round the cross  macian drew in his breath  as children do at anyth they think utter beauti  for he could imagin noth that so echo his own vision of pontif or chivalr art as this white dome sit like a vast silver tiara over london  ring with a tripl crown of sword  as they went sail down ludgat hill  evan saw that the state of the street fulli answer his companion  s claim about the reintroduct of order  all the old blackcoat bustl with it cockney vivac and vulgar had disappear  group of labour  quiet but picturesqu clad  were pass up and down in suffici larg number  but it requir but a few mount men to keep the street in order  the mount men were not common policemen  but knight with spur and plume whose smooth and splendid armour glitter like diamond rather than steel  onli in one place  at the corner of bouveri street  did there appear to be a moment  s confus  and that was due to hurri rather than resist  but one old grumbl man did not get out of the way quick enough  and the man on horseback struck him  not sever  across the shoulder with the flat of his sword   the soldier had no busi to do that  said macian  sharpli   the old man was move as quick as he could   we attach great import to disciplin in the street  said the man in white  with a slight smile   disciplin is not so import as justic  said macian  the other did not answer  then after a swift silenc that took them out across st  jame  s park  he said   the peopl must be taught to obey  they must learn their own ignor  and i am not sure  he continu  turn his back on evan and look out of the prow of the ship into the dark   i am not sure that i agre with your littl maxim about justic  disciplin for the whole societi is sure more import than justic to an individu  evan  who was also lean over the edg  swung round with startl sudden and stare at the other  s back   disciplin for societi  he repeat  veri staccato   more import  justic to individu  then after a long silenc he call out   who and what are you   i am an angel  said the white  robe figur  without turn round   you are not a cathol  said macian  the other seem to take no notic  but revert to the main topic   in our armi up in heaven we learn to put a wholesom fear into subordin  macian sat crane his neck forward with an extraordinari and unaccount eager   go on  he cri  twist and untwist his long  boni finger   go on   besid  continu he  in the prow   you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughti in the superior type   go on  said evan  with burn eye   just as the sight of sin offend god  said the unknown   so doe the sight of ugli offend apollo  the beauti and princ must  of necess  be impati with the squalid and   whi  you great fool  cri macian  rise to the top of his tremend statur   did you think i would have doubt onli for that rap with a sword  i know that nobl order have bad knight  that good knight have bad temper  that the church has rough priest and coars cardin  i have known it ever sinc i was born  you fool  you had onli to say   yes  it is rather a shame  and i should have forgotten the affair  but i saw on your mouth the twitch of your infern sophistri  i knew that someth was wrong with you and your cathedr  someth is wrong  everyth is wrong  you are not an angel  that is not a church  it is not the right king who has come home   that is unfortun  said the other  in a quiet but hard voic   becaus you are go to see his majesti   no  said macian   i am go to jump over the side   do you desir death   no  said evan  quit compos   i desir a miracl   from whom do you ask it  to whom do you appeal  said his companion  stern   you have betray the king  renounc his cross on the cathedr  and insult an archangel   i appeal to god  said evan  and sprang up and stood upon the edg of the sway ship  the be in the prow turn slowli round  he look at evan with eye which were like two sun  and put his hand to his mouth just too late to hide an aw smile   and how do you know  he said   how do you know that i am not god  macian scream   ah  he cri   now i know who you realli are  you are not god  you are not one of god  s angel  but you were onc  the be  s hand drop from his mouth and evan drop out of the car  xvi  the dream of turnbul turnbul was walk rather rampant up and down the garden on a gusti even chew his cigar and in that mood when everi man suppress an instinct to spit  he was not  as a rule  a man much acquaint with mood  and the storm and sunburst of macian  s soul pass befor him as an impress but unmean panorama  like the anarchi of highland sceneri  turnbul was one of those men in whom a continu appetit and industri of the intellect leav the emot veri simpl and steadi  his heart was in the right place  but he was quit content to leav it there  it was his head that was his hobbi  his morn and even were mark not by impuls or thirsti desir  not by hope or by heart  break  they were fill with the fallaci he had detect  the problem he had made plain  the advers theori he had wrestl with and thrown  the grand general he had justifi  but even the cheer inner life of a logician may be upset by a lunat asylum  to say noth of whiff of memori from a ladi in jersey  and the littl red  beard man on this windi even was in a danger frame of mind  plain and posit as he was  the influenc of earth and sky may have been greater on him than he imagin  and the weather that walk the world at that moment was as red and angri as turnbul  long strip and swirl of tatter and tawni cloud were drag downward to the west exact as torn red raiment would be drag  and so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whip away fragment of red  flower bush or of copper beech  and drove them also across the garden  a drift of red leav  like the leav of autumn  as in parodi of the red and driven rag of cloud  there was a sens in earth and heaven as of everyth break up  and all the revolutionist in turnbul rejoic that it was break up  the tree were break up under the wind  even in the tall strength of their bloom  the cloud were break up and lose even their larg herald shape  shard and shred of copper cloud split off continu and float by themselv  and for some reason the trucul eye of turnbul was attract to one of these career cloudlet  which seem to him to career in an exagger manner  also it kept it shape  which is unusu with cloud shaken off  also it shape was of an odd sort  turnbul continu to stare at it  and in a littl time occur that crucial instant when a thing  howev incred  is accept as a fact  the copper cloud was tumbl down toward the earth  like some gigant leaf from the copper beech  and as it came nearer it was evid  first  that it was not a cloud  and  second  that it was not itself of the colour of copper  onli  be burnish like a mirror  it had reflect the red  brown colour of the burn cloud  as the thing whirl like a windswept leaf down toward the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of air  ship made of metal  and slap the air with big broad fin of steel  when it came about a hundr feet abov the garden  a shaggi  lean figur leapt up in it  almost black against the bronz and scarlet of the west  and  fling out a kind of hook or anchor  caught on to the green appl  tree just under the wall  and from that fix hold ground the ship swung in the red tempest like a captiv balloon  while our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonish  the queer figur in the airi car tip the vehicl almost upsid down by leap over the side of it  seem to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey  and alight  with imposs precis and placid  seat on the edg of the wall  over which he kick and dangl his leg as he grin at turnbul  the wind roar in the tree yet more ruinous and desol  the red tail of the sunset were drag downward like red dragon suck down to death  and still on the top of the asylum wall sat the sinist figur with the grimac  swing his feet in tune with the tempest  while abov him  at the end of it toss or tighten cord  the enorm iron air  ship float as light and as littl notic as a babi  s balloon upon it string  turnbul  s first movement after sixti motionless second was to turn round and look at the larg  luxuri parallelogram of the garden and the long  low rectangular build beyond  there was not a soul or a stir of life within sight  and he had a quit meaningless sensat  as if there never realli had been ani one els there except he sinc the foundat of the world  stiffen in himself the masculin but mirthless courag of the atheist  he drew a littl nearer to the wall and  catch the man at a slight differ angl of the even light  could see his face and figur quit plain  two fact about him stood out in the pick colour of some pirat schoolboy  s stori  the first was that his lean brown bodi was bare to the belt of his loos white trouser  the other that through hygien  affect  or whatev other caus  he had a scarlet handkerchief tie tight but somewhat aslant across his brow  after these two fact had becom emphat  other appear suffici import  one was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plenti  but white as with the last snow of mortal  anoth was that under the mop of white and senil hair the face was strong  handsom  and smile  with a well  cut profil and a long cloven chin  the length of this lower part of the face and the strang cleft in it  which gave the man  in quit anoth sens from the common one  a doubl chin  faint spoilt the claim of the face to absolut regular  but it great assist it in wear the express of half  smile and half  sneer arrog with which it was stare at all the stone  all the flower  but especi at the solitari man   what do you want  shout turnbul   i want you  jimmi  said the eccentr man on the wall  and with the veri word he had let himself down with a leap on to the centr of the lawn  where he bound onc liter like an india  rubber ball and then stood grin with his leg astrid  the onli three fact that turnbul could now add to his inventori were that the man had an ugli  look knife swing at his trouser belt  that his brown feet were as bare as his bronz trunk and arm  and that his eye had a singular bleak brillianc which was of no particular colour   excus my not be in even dress  said the newcom with an urban smile   we scientif men  you know  i have to work my own engin  electr engin  veri hot work   look here  said turnbul  sturdili clench his fist in his trouser pocket   i am bound to expect lunat insid these four wall  but i do bar their come from outsid  bang out of the sunset cloud   and yet you came from the outsid  too  jim  said the stranger in a voic almost affection   what do you want  ask turnbul  with an explos of temper as sudden as a pistol shot   i have alreadi told you  said the man  lower his voic and speak with evid sincer   i want you   what do you want with me   i want exact what you want  said the new  comer with a new graviti   i want the revolut  turnbul look at the fire  swept sky and the wind  stricken woodland  and kept on repeat the word voiceless to himself  the word that did inde so thorough express his mood of rage as it had been among those red cloud and rock tree  top   revolut  he said to himself   the revolut  yes  that is what i want right enough  anyth  so long as it is a revolut  to some caus he could never explain he found himself complet the sentenc on the top of the wall  have automat follow the stranger so far  but when the stranger silent indic the rope that led to the machin  he found himself paus and say   i can  t leav macian behind in this den   we are go to destroy the pope and all the king  said the new  comer   would it be wiser to take him with us  somehow the mutter turnbul found himself in the fli ship also  and it swung up into the sunset   all the great rebel have been veri littl rebel  said the man with the red scarf   they have been like fourth  form boy who sometim ventur to hit a fifth  form boy  that was all the worth of their french revolut and regicid  the boy never realli dare to defi the schoolmast   whom do you mean by the schoolmast  ask turnbul   you know whom i mean  answer the strang man  as he lay back on cushion and look up into the angri sky  they seem rise into stronger and stronger sunlight  as if it were sunris rather than sunset  but when they look down at the earth they saw it grow darker and darker  the lunat asylum in it larg rectangular ground spread below them in a foreshorten and infantil plan  and look for the first time the grotesqu thing that it was  but the clear colour of the plan were grow darker everi moment  the mass of rose or rhododendron deepen from crimson to violet  the maze of gravel pathway fade from gold to brown  by the time they had risen a few hundr feet higher noth could be seen of that darken landscap except the line of light window  each one of which  at least  was the light of one lost intellig  but on them as they swept upward better and braver wind seem to blow  and on them the rubi light of even seem struck  and splash like red spurt from the grape of dionysus  below them the fallen light were liter the fallen star of servitud  and abov them all the red and rage cloud were like the leap flag of liberti  the man with the cloven chin seem to have a singular power of understand thought  for  as turnbul felt the whole univers tilt and turn over his head  the stranger said exact the right thing   doesn  t it seem as if everyth were be upset  said he   and if onc everyth is upset  he will be upset on top of it  then  as turnbul made no answer  his host continu   that is the realli fine thing about space  it is topsi  turvi  you have onli to climb far enough toward the morn star to feel that you are come down to it  you have onli to dive deep enough into the abyss to feel that you are rise  that is the onli glori of this univers  it is a giddi univers  then  as turnbul was still silent  he ad   the heaven are full of revolut  of the real sort of revolut  all the high thing are sink low and all the big thing look small  all the peopl who think they are aspir find they are fall head foremost  and all the peopl who think they are condescend find they are climb up a precipic  that is the intox of space  that is the onli joy of etern  doubt  there is onli one pleasur the angel can possibl have in fli  and that is  that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heel  then  find his companion still mute  he fell himself into a smile and motionless medit  at the end of which he said sudden   so macian convert you  turnbul sprang up as if spurn the steel car from under his feet   convert me  he cri   what the devil do you mean  i have known him for a month  and i have not retract a singl   this catholic is a curious thing  said the man of the cloven chin in uninterrupt reflect  lean his eleg elbow over the edg of the vessel   it soak and weaken men without their know it  just as i fear it has soak and weaken you  turnbul stood in an attitud which might well have meant pitch the other man out of the fli ship   i am an atheist  he said  in a stifl voic   i have alway been an atheist  i am still an atheist  then  address the other  s indol and indiffer back  he cri   in god  s name what do you mean  and the other answer without turn round   i mean noth in god  s name  turnbul spat over the edg of the car and fell back furious into his seat  the other continu still unruffl  and stare over the edg idl as an angler stare down at a stream   the truth is that we never thought that you could have been caught  he said   we count on you as the one red  hot revolutionari left in the world  but  of cours  these men like macian are aw clever  especi when they pretend to be stupid  turnbul leapt up again in a live furi and cri   what have i got to do with macian  i believ all i ever believ  and disbeliev all i ever disbeliev  what doe all this mean  and what do you want with me here  then for the first time the other lift himself from the edg of the car and face him   i have brought you here  he answer   to take part in the last war of the world   the last war  repeat turnbul  even in his daze state a littl touchi about such a dogma   how do you know it will be the last  the man laid himself back in his repos attitud  and said   it is the last war  becaus if it doe not cure the world for ever  it will destroy it   what do you mean   i onli mean what you mean  answer the unknown in a temper voic   what was it that you alway meant on those million and one night when you walk outsid your ludgat hill shop and shook your hand in the air   still i do not see  said turnbul  stubborn   you will soon  said the other  and abrupt bent downward one iron handl of his huge machin  the engin stop  stoop  and dive almost as deliber as a man bath  in their downward rush they swept within fifti yard of a big bulk of stone that turnbul knew onli too well  the last red anger of the sunset was end  the dome of heaven was dark  the lane of flare light in the street below hard lit up the base of the build  but he saw that it was st  paul  s cathedr  and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still stand erect  but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideway  then onli he care to look down into the street  and saw that they were inflam with uproar and toss passion   we arriv at a happi moment  said the man steer the ship   the insurg are bombard the citi  and a cannon  ball has just hit the cross  mani of the insurg are simpl peopl  and they natur regard it as a happi omen   quit so  said turnbul  in a rather colourless voic   yes  repli the other   i thought you would be glad to see your prayer answer  of cours i apolog for the word prayer   don  t mention it  said turnbul  the fli ship had come down upon a sort of curv  and was now rise again  the higher and higher it rose the broader and broader becam the scene of flame and desol underneath  ludgat hill inde had been an uncaptur and compar quiet height  alter onli by the startl coincid of the cross fallen awri  all the other thoroughfar on all side of that hill were full of the pulsat and the pain of battl  full of shake torch and shout face  when at length they had risen high enough to have a bird  s  eye view of the whole campaign  turnbul was alreadi intox  he had smelt gunpowd  which was the incens of his own revolutionari religion   have the peopl realli risen  he ask  breathless   what are they fight about   the programm is rather elabor  said his entertain with some indiffer   i think dr  hertz drew it up  turnbul wrinkl his forehead   are all the poor peopl with the revolut  he ask  the other shrug his shoulder   all the instruct and class  conscious part of them without except  he repli   there were certain a few district  in fact  we are pass over them just now  turnbul look down and saw that the polish car was liter lit up from underneath by the far  flung fire from below  underneath whole squar and solid district were in flame  like prairi or forest on fire   dr  hertz has convinc everybodi  said turnbul  s ciceron in a smooth voic   that noth can realli be done with the real slum  his celebr maxim has been quit adopt  i mean the three celebr sentenc   no man should be unemploy  employ the employ  destroy the unemploy  there was a silenc  and then turnbul said in a rather strain voic   and do i understand that this good work is go on under here   go on splendid  repli his companion in the heartiest voic   you see  these peopl were much too tire and weak even to join the social war  they were a definit hindranc to it   and so you are simpli burn them out   it does seem absurd simpl  said the man  with a beam smile   when one think of all the worri and talk about help a hopeless slave popul  when the futur obvious was onli cri to be rid of them  there are happi babe unborn readi to burst the door when these drivel are swept away   will you permit me to say  said turnbul  after reflect   that i don  t like all this   and will you permit me to say  said the other  with a snap   that i don  t like mr  evan macian  somewhat to the speaker  s surpris this did not inflam the sensit sceptic  he had the air of think thorough  and then he said   no  i don  t think it  s my friend macian that taught me that  i think i should alway have said that i don  t like this  these peopl have right   right  repeat the unknown in a tone quit indescrib  then he ad with a more open sneer   perhap they also have soul   they have live  said turnbul  stern   that is quit enough for me  i understood you to say that you thought life sacr   yes  inde  cri his mentor with a sort of idealist anim   yes  inde  life is sacr  but live are not sacr  we are improv life by remov live  can you  as a free  thinker  find ani fault in that   yes  said turnbul with breviti   yet you applaud tyrannicid  said the stranger with rationalist gaieti   how inconsist  it realli come to this  you approv of take away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasur  but you will not take away life from those to whom it is a burden and a toil  turnbul rose to his feet in the car with consider deliber  but his face seem odd pale  the other went on with enthusiasm   life  yes  life is inde sacr  he cri   but new live for old  good live for bad  on that veri place where now there sprawl one drunken wastrel of a pavement artist more or less wish he were dead  on that veri spot there shall in the futur be live pictur  there shall be golden girl and boy leap in the sun  turnbul  still stand up  open his lip   will you put me down  pleas  he said  quit calm  like on stop an omnibus   put you down  what do you mean  cri his leader   i am take you to the front of the revolutionari war  where you will be one of the first of the revolutionari leader   thank you  repli turnbul with the same pain constraint   i have heard about your revolutionari war  and i think on the whole that i would rather be anywher els   do you want to be taken to a monasteri  snarl the other   with macian and his wink madonna   i want to be taken to a madhous  said turnbul distinct  give the direct with a sort of precis   i want to go back to exact the same lunat asylum from which i came   whi  ask the unknown   becaus i want a littl sane and wholesom societi  answer turnbul  there was a long and peculiar silenc  and then the man drive the fli machin said quit coolli   i won  t take you back  and then turnbul said equal coolli   then i  ll jump out of the car  the unknown rose to his full height  and the express in his eye seem to be made of ironi behind ironi  as two mirror infinit reflect each other  at last he said  veri grave   do you think i am the devil   yes  said turnbul  violent   for i think the devil is a dream  and so are you  i don  t believ in you or your fli ship or your last fight of the world  it is all a nightmar  i say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmar  and i will be a martyr for my faith as much as st  catherin  for i will jump out of this ship and risk wake up safe in bed  after sway twice with the sway vessel he dive over the side as one dive into the sea  for some incred moment star and space and planet seem to shoot up past him as the spark fli upward  and yet in that sicken descent he was full of some unnatur happi  he could connect it with no idea except one that half escap him  what evan had said of the differ between christ and satan  that it was by christ  s own choic that he descend into hell  when he again realiz anyth  he was lie on his elbow on the lawn of the lunat asylum  and the last red of the sunset had not yet disappear  xvii  the idiot evan macian was stand a few yard off look at him in absolut silenc  he had not the moral courag to ask macian if there had been anyth astound in the manner of his come there  nor did macian seem to have ani question to ask  or perhap ani need to ask it  the two men came slowli toward each other  and found the same express on each other  s face  then  for the first time in all their acquaint  they shook hand  almost as if this were a kind of unconsci signal  it brought dr  quayl bound out of a door and run across the lawn   oh  there you are  he exclaim with a reliev giggl   will you come insid  pleas  i want to speak to you both  they follow him into his shini wooden offic where their damn record was kept  dr  quayl sat down on a swivel chair and swung round to face them  his carv smile had sudden disappear   i will be plain with you gentlemen  he said  abrupt   you know quit well we do our best for everybodi here  your case have been under special consider  and the master himself has decid that you ought to be treat special and  er  under somewhat simpler condit   you mean treat wors  i suppos  said turnbul  gruffli  the doctor did not repli  and macian said   i expect this  his eye had begun to glow  the doctor answer  look at his desk and play with a key   well  in certain case that give anxieti  it is often better   give anxieti  said turnbul  fierc   confound your impud  what do you mean  you imprison two perfect sane men in a madhous becaus you have made up a long word  they take it in good temper  walk and talk in your garden like monk who have found a vocat  are civil even to you  you damn druggist  hack  behav not onli more sane than ani of your patient  but more sane than half the sane men outsid  and you have the soul  stifl cheek to say that they give anxieti   the head of the asylum has settl it all  said dr  quayl  still look down  macian took one of his immens stride forward and stood over the doctor with flame eye   if the head has settl it let the head announc it  he said   i won  t take it from you  i believ you to be a low  gibber degener  let us see the head of the asylum   see the head of the asylum  repeat dr  quayl   certain not  the tall highland  bend over him  put one hand on his shoulder with father interest   you don  t seem to appreci the peculiar advantag of my posit as a lunat  he said   i could kill you with my left hand befor such a rat as you could so much as squeak  and i wouldn  t be hang for it   i certain agre with mr  macian  said turnbul with sobrieti and perfect respect   that you had better let us see the head of the institut  dr  quayl got to his feet in a mixtur of sudden hysteria and clumsi presenc of mind   oh  certain  he said with a weak laugh   you can see the head of the asylum if you particular want to  he almost ran out of the room  and the two follow swift on his fli coat tail  he knock at an ordinari varnish door in the corridor  when a voic said   come in  macian  s breath went hiss back through his teeth into his chest  turnbul was more impetu  and open the door  it was a neat and well  appoint room entir line with a medic librari  at the other end of it was a ponder and polish desk with an incandesc lamp on it  the light of which was just suffici to show a slender  well  bred figur in an ordinari medic black frock  coat  whose head  quit silver with age  was bent over neat pile of note  this gentleman look up for an instant as they enter  and the lamplight fell on his glitter spectacl and long  clean  shaven face  a face which would have been simpli like an aristocrat  s but that a certain lion pois of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a veri handsom actor  s  it was onli for a flash that his face was thus lift  then he bent his silver head over his note onc more  and said  without look up again   i told you  dr  quayl  that these men were to go to cell b and c  turnbul and macian look at each other  and said more than they could ever say with tongu or sword  among other thing they said that to that particular head of the institut it was a wast of time to appeal  and they follow dr  quayl out of the room  the instant they step out into the corridor four sturdi figur step from four side  pinion them  and ran them along the galleri  they might veri like have thrown their captor right and left had they been inclin to resist  but for some nameless reason they were more inclin to laugh  a mixtur of mad ironi with childish curios made them feel quit inclin to see what next twist would be taken by their imbecil luck  they were drag down countless cold avenu line with glaze tile  differ onli in be of differ length and set at differ angl  they were so mani and so monoton that to escap back by them would have been far harder than flee from the hampton court maze  onli the fact that window grew fewer  come at longer interv  and the fact that when the window did come they seem shadow and let in less light  show that they were wind into the core or belli of some enorm build  after a littl time the glaze corridor began to be lit by electr  at last  when they had walk near a mile in those white and polish tunnel  they came with quit a shock to the futil final of a cul  de  sac  all that white and weari journey end sudden in an oblong space and a blank white wall  but in the white wall there were two iron door paint white on which were written  respect  in neat black capit b and c   you go in here  sir  said the leader of the offici  quit respect   and you in here  but befor the door had clang upon their daze victim  macian had been abl to say to turnbul with a strang drawl of signific   i wonder who a is  turnbul made an automat struggl befor he allow himself to be thrown into the cell  henc it happen that he was the last to enter  and was still full of the exhilar of the adventur for at least five minut after the echo of the clang door had die away  then  when silenc had sunk deep and noth happen for two and a half hour  it sudden occur to him that this was the end of his life  he was hidden and seal up in this littl crack of stone until the flesh should fall off his bone  he was dead  and the world had won  his cell was of an oblong shape  but veri long in comparison with it width  it was just wide enough to permit the arm to be fulli extend with the dumb  bell  which were hung up on the left wall  veri dusti  it was  howev  long enough for a man to walk one thirti  fifth part of a mile if he travers it entir  on the same principl a row of fix hole  quit close togeth  let in to the cell by pipe what was alleg to be the freshest air  for these great scientif organ insist that a man should be healthi even if he was miser  they provid a walk long enough to give him exercis and hole larg enough to give him oxygen  there their interest in human natur sudden ceas  it seem never to have occur to them that the benefit of exercis belong part to the benefit of liberti  they had not entertain the suggest that the open air is onli one of the advantag of the open sky  they administ air in secret  but in suffici dose  as if it were a medicin  they suggest walk  as if no man had ever felt inclin to walk  abov all  the asylum author insist on their own extraordinari cleanli  everi morn  while turnbul was still half asleep on his iron bedstead which was lift half  way up the wall and clamp to it with iron  four sluic or metal mouth open abov him at the four corner of the chamber and wash it white of ani defil  turnbul  s solitari soul surg up against this sicken daili solemn   i am buri aliv  he cri  bitter   they have hidden me under mountain  i shall be here till i rot  whi the blaze should it matter to them whether i am dirti or clean  everi morn and even an iron hatchway open in his oblong cell  and a brown hairi hand or two thrust in a plate of perfect cook lentil and a big bowl of cocoa  he was not underf ani more than he was underexercis or asphyxi  he had ampl walk space  ampl air  ampl and even fill food  the onli object was that he had noth to walk toward  noth to feast about  and no reason whatev for draw the breath of life  even the shape of his cell especi irrit him  it was a long  narrow parallelogram  which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other  but that end was broken by a wedg or angl of space  like the prow of a ship  after three day of silenc and cocoa  this angl at the end began to infuri turnbul  it madden him to think that two line came togeth and point at noth  after the fifth day he was reckless  and poke his head into the corner  after twenti  five day he almost broke his head against it  then he becam quit cool and stupid again  and began to examin it like a sort of robinson cruso  almost unconsci it was his instinct to examin outlet  and he found himself pay particular attent to the row of hole which let in the air into his last hous of life  he soon discov that these air  hole were all the end and mouth of long leaden tube which doubtless carri air from some remot water  place near margat  one even while he was engag in the fifth investig he notic someth like twilight in one of these dumb mouth  as compar with the dark of the other  thrust his finger in as far as it would go  he found a hole and flap edg in the tube  this he rent open and instant saw a light behind  it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell  it is a characterist of all thing now call  effici  which mean mechan and calcul  that if they go wrong at all they go entir wrong  there is no power of retriev a defeat  as in simpler and more live organ  a strong gun can conquer a strong eleph  but a wound eleph can easili conquer a broken gun  thus the prussian monarchi in the eighteenth centuri  or now  can make a strong armi mere by make the men afraid  but it doe it with the perman possibl that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemi than of their offic  thus the drainag in our citi so long as it is quit solid mean a general safeti  but if there is one leak it mean concentr poison  an explos of death germ like dynamit  a spirit of stink  thus  inde  all that excel machineri which is the swiftest thing on earth in save human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resist human interfer  it may be easier to get chocol for noth out of a shopkeep than out of an automat machin  but if you did manag to steal the chocol  the automat machin would be much less like to run after you  turnbul was not long in discov this truth in connexion with the cold and coloss machineri of this great asylum  he had been shaken by mani spiritu state sinc the instant when he was pitch head foremost into that privat cell which was to be his privat room till death  he had felt a high fit of pride and poetri  which had eb away and left him dead cold  he had known a period of mere scientif curios  in the cours of which he examin all the tile of his cell  with the gratifi conclus that they were all the same shape and size  but was great puzzl about the angl in the wall at the end  and also about an iron peg or spike that stood out from the wall  the object of which he doe not know to this day  then he had a period of mere mad not to be written of by decent men  but onli by those few dirti novelist halloo on by the infern huntsman to hunt down and humili human natur  this also pass  but left behind it a feverish distast for mani of the mere object around him  long after he had return to saniti and such hopeless cheer as a man might have on a desert island  he dislik the regular squar of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangl that termin his corridor  abov all  he had a hatr  deep as the hell he did not believ in  for the objectless iron peg in the wall  but in all his mood  sane or insan  intoler or stoical  he never realli doubt this  that the machin held him as light and as hopeless as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed  he knew well the ruthless and inexhaust resourc of our scientif civil  he no more expect rescu from a medic certif than rescu from the solar system  in mani of his robinson cruso mood he thought kind of macian as of some quarrelsom school  fellow who had long been dead  he thought of leav in the cell when he die a rigid record of his opinion  and when he began to write them down on scrap of envelop in his pocket  he was startl to discov how much they had chang  then he rememb the beauchamp tower  and tri to write his blaze sceptic on the wall  and discov that it was all shini tile on which noth could be either drawn or carv  then for an instant there hung and broke abov him like a high wave the whole horror of scientif imprison  which manag to deni a man not onli liberti  but everi accident comfort of bondag  in the old filthi dungeon men could carv their prayer or protest in the rock  here the white and slipperi wall escap even from bear wit  the old prison could make a pet of a mous or a beetl stray out of a hole  here the unpierc wall were wash everi morn by an automat sluic  there was no natur corrupt and no merci decay by which a live thing could enter in  then jame turnbul look up and saw the high invinc hate of the societi in which he live  and saw the hate of someth els also  which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believ  but all the time he had never onc doubt that the five side of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward  and it gave him a shock of surpris even to discov the faint light through the apertur in the ventil tube  but he had forgotten how close effici has to pack everyth togeth and how easili  therefor  a pipe here or there may leak  turnbul thrust his first finger down the apertur  and at last manag to make a slight further fissur in the pipe  the light that came up from beyond was veri faint  and appar indirect  it seem to fall from some hole or window higher up  as he was screw his eye to peer at this grey and greasi twilight he was astonish to see anoth human finger veri long and lean come down from abov toward the broken pipe and hook it up to someth higher  the light apertur was abrupt blacken and block  presum by a face and mouth  for someth human spoke down the tube  though the word were not clear   who is that  ask turnbul  trembl with excit  yet wari and quit resolv not to spoil ani chanc  after a few indistinct sound the voic came down with a strong argyllshir accent   i say  turnbul  we couldn  t fight through this tube  could we  sentiment beyond speech surg up in turnbul and silenc him for a space just long enough to be pain  then he said with his old gaieti   i vote we talk a littl first  i don  t want to murder the first man i have met for ten million year   i know what you mean  answer the other   it has been aw  for a mortal month i have been alon with god  turnbul start  and it was on the tip of his tongu to answer   alon with god  then you do not know what loneli is  but he answer  after all  in his old defiant style   alon with god  were you  and i suppos you found his majesti  s societi rather monoton   oh  no  said macian  and his voic shudder   it was a great deal too excit  after a veri long silenc the voic of macian said   what do you realli hate most in your place   you  d think i was realli mad if i told you  answer turnbul  bitter   then i expect it  s the same as mine  said the other voic   i am sure it  s not the same as anybodi  s  said turnbul   for it has no rhyme or reason  perhap my brain realli has gone  but i detest that iron spike in the left wall more than the damn desol or the damn cocoa  have you got one in your cell   not now  repli macian with seren   i  ve pull it out  his fellow  prison could onli repeat the word   i pull it out the other day when i was off my head  continu the tranquil highland voic   it look so unnecessari   you must be ghast strong  said turnbul   one is  when one is mad  was the careless repli   and it had worn a littl loos in the socket  even now i  ve got it out i can  t discov what it was for  but i  ve found out someth a long sight funnier   what do you mean  ask turnbul   i have found out where a is  said the other  three week afterward macian had manag to open up communic which made his mean plain  by that time the two captiv had fulli discov and demonstr that weak in the veri natur of modern machineri to which we have alreadi refer  the veri fact that they were isol from all companion meant that they were free from all spi  and as there were no gaoler to be bribe  so there were none to be baffl  machineri brought them their cocoa and clean their cell  that machineri was as helpless as it was pitiless  a littl patient violenc  conduct day after day amid constant mutual suggest  open an irregular hole in the wall  larg enough to let in a small man  in the exact place where there had been befor the tini ventil hole  turnbul tumbl somehow into macian  s apart  and his first glanc found out that the iron spike was inde pluck from it socket  and left  moreov  anoth rag hole into some hollow place behind  but for this macian  s cell was the duplic of turnbul  s  a long oblong end in a wedg and line with cold and lustrous tile  the small hole from which the peg had been displac was in that short obliqu wall at the end nearest to turnbul  s  that individu look at it with a puzzl face   what is in there  he ask  macian answer briefli   anoth cell   but where can the door of it be  said his companion  even more puzzl   the door of our cell are at the other end   it has no door  said evan  in the paus of perplex that follow  an eeri and sinist feel crept over turnbul  s stubborn soul in spite of himself  the notion of the doorless room chill him with that sens of half  wit curios which one has when someth horribl is half understood   jame turnbul  said macian  in a low and shaken voic   these peopl hate us more than nero hate christian  and fear us more than ani man fear nero  they have fill england with frenzi and gallop in order to captur us and wipe us out  in order to kill us  and they have kill us  for you and i have onli made a hole in our coffin  but though this hatr that they felt for us is bigger than they felt for bonapart  and more plain and practic than they would feel for jack the ripper  yet it is not we whom the peopl of this place hate most  a cold and quiver impati continu to crawl up turnbul  s spine  he had never felt so near to superstit and supernatur  and it was not a pretti sort of superstit either   there is anoth man more fear and hate  went on macian  in his low monoton voic   and they have buri him even deeper  god know how they did it  for he was let in by neither door nor window  nor lower through ani open abov  i expect these iron handl that we both hate have been part of some damn machineri for wall him up  he is there  i have look through the hole at him  but i cannot stand look at him long  becaus his face is turn away from me and he doe not move  al turnbul  s unnatur and uncomplet feel found their outlet in rush to the apertur and look into the unknown room  it was a third oblong cell exact like the other two except that it was doorless  and except that on one of the wall was paint a larg black a like the b and c outsid their own door  the letter in this case was not paint outsid  becaus this prison had no outsid  on the same kind of tile floor  of which the monoton squar had madden turnbul  s eye and brain  was sit a figur which was startl short even for a child  onli that the enorm head was ring with hair of a frosti grey  the figur was drape  both insecur and insuffici  in what look like the remain of a brown flannel dress  gown  an empti cup of cocoa stood on the floor besid it  and the creatur had his big grey head cock at a particular angl of inquiri or attent which amid all that gather gloom and mysteri struck one as comic if not cocksur  after six still second turnbul could stand it no longer  but call out to the dwarfish thing  in what word heaven know  the thing got up with the promptitud of an anim  and turn round offer the spectacl of two owlish eye and a huge grey  and  white beard not unlik the plumag of an owl  this extraordinari beard cover him liter to his feet  not that that was veri far  and perhap it was as well that it did  for portion of his remain cloth seem to fall off whenev he move  one talk trivial of a face like parchment  but this old man  s face was so wrinkl that it was like a parchment load with hieroglyph  the line of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten differ face besid the real one  as one can see them in an elabor wall  paper  and yet while his face seem like a scriptur older than the god  his eye were quit bright  blue  and startl like those of a babi  they look as if they had onli an instant befor been fit into his head  everyth depend so obvious upon whether this buri monster spoke that turnbul did not know or care whether he himself had spoken  he said someth or noth  and then he wait for this dwarfish voic that had been hidden under the mountain of the world  at last it did speak  and spoke in english  with a foreign accent that was neither latin nor teuton  he sudden stretch out a long and veri dirti forefing  and cri in a voic of clear recognit  like a child  s   that  s a hole  he digest the discoveri for some second  suck his finger  and then he cri  with a crow of laughter   and that  s a head come through it  the hilari energi in this idiot attitud gave turnbul anoth sick turn  he had grown to toler those dreari and mumbl madmen who trail themselv about the beauti asylum garden  but there was someth new and subvers of the univers in the combin of so much cheer decis with a bodi without a brain   whi did they put you in such a place  he ask at last with embarrass   good place  yes  said the old man  nod a great mani time and beam like a flatter landlord   good shape  long and narrow  with a point  like this  and he made love with his hand a map of the room in the air   but that  s not the best  he ad  confidenti   squar veri good  i have a nice long holiday  and can count them  but that  s not the best   what is the best  ask turnbul in great distress   spike is the best  said the old man  open his blue eye blaze   it stick out  the word turnbul spoke broke out of him in pure piti   can  t we do anyth for you  he said   i am veri happi  said the other  alphabet   you are a good man  can i help you   no  i don  t think you can  sir  said turnbul with rough patho   i am glad you are content at least  the weird old person open his broad blue eye and fix turnbul with a stare extraordinarili sever   you are quit sure  he said   i cannot help you   quit sure  thank you  said turnbul with broken breviti   good day  then he turn to macian who was stand close behind him  and whose face  now familiar in all it mood  told him easili that evan had heard the whole of the strang dialogu   curs those cruel beast  cri turnbul   they  ve turn him to an imbecil just by buri him aliv  his brain  s like a pin  point now   you are sure he is a lunat  said evan  slowli   not a lunat  said turnbul   an idiot  he just point to thing and say that they stick out   he had a notion that he could help us  said macian moodili  and began to pace toward the other end of his cell   yes  it was a bit pathet  assent turnbul   such a thing offer help  and besid  hallo  hallo  what  s the matter   god almighti guid us all  said macian  he was stand heavi and still at the other end of the room and stare quiet at the door which for thirti day had seal them up from the sun  turnbul  follow the other  s eye  stare at the door likewis  and then he also utter an exclam  the iron door was stand about an inch and a half open   he said  began evan  in a trembl voic  he offer   come along  you fool  shout turnbul with a sudden and furious energi   i see it all now  and it  s the best stroke of luck in the world  you pull out that iron handl that had screw up his cell  and it somehow alter the machineri and open all the door  seiz macian by the elbow he bundl him bodili out into the open corridor and ran him on till they saw daylight through a half  darken window   all the same  said evan  like one answer in an ordinari convers   he did ask you whether he could help you  all this wilder of windowless passag was so built into the heart of that fortress of fear that it seem more than an hour befor the fugit had ani good glimps of the outer world  they did not even know what hour of the day it was  and when  turn a corner  they saw the bare tunnel of the corridor end abrupt in a shine squar of garden  the grass burn in that strong even sunshin which make it burnish gold rather than green  the abrupt open on to the earth seem like a hole knock in the wall of heaven  onli onc or twice in life is it permit to a man thus to see the veri univers from outsid  and feel exist itself as an ador adventur not yet begun  as they found this shine escap out of that hellish labyrinth they both had simultan the sensat of be babe unborn  of be ask by god if they would like to live upon the earth  they were look in at one of the seven gate of eden  turnbul was the first to leap into the garden  with an earth  spurn leap like that of one who could realli spread his wing and fli  macian  who came an instant after  was less full of mere anim gusto and fuller of a more fear and quiver pleasur in the clear and innoc flower colour and the high and holi tree  with one bound they were in that cool and clear landscap  and they found just outsid the door the black  clad gentleman with the cloven chin smile regard them  and his chin seem to grow longer and longer as he smile  xviii  a riddl of face just behind him stood two other doctor  one  the familiar dr  quayl  of the blink eye and bleat voic  the other  a more commonplac but much more forcibl figur  a stout young doctor with short  well  brush hair and a round but resolut face  at the sight of the escap these two subordin utter a cri and sprang forward  but their superior remain motionless and smile  and somehow the lack of his support seem to arrest and freez them in the veri gestur of pursuit   let them be  he cri in a voic that cut like a blade of ice  and not onli of ice  but of some aw primordi ice that had never been water   i want no devot champion  said the cut voic   even the folli of one  s friend bore one at last  you don  t suppos i should have let these lunat out of their cell without good reason  i have the best and fullest reason  they can be let out of their cell today  becaus today the whole world has becom their cell  i will have no more mediev mummeri of chain and door  let them wander about the earth as they wander about this garden  and i shall still be their easi master  let them take the wing of the morn and abid in the uttermost part of the sea  i am there  whither shall they go from my presenc and whither shall they flee from my spirit  courag  dr  quayl  and do not be downheart  the real day of tyranni are onli begin on this earth  and with that the master laugh and swung away from them  almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for peopl to see   might i speak to you a moment  said turnbul  step forward with a respect resolut  but the shoulder of the master onli seem to take on a new and unexpect angl of mockeri as he strode away  turnbul swung round with great abrupt to the other two doctor  and said  harsh   what in snake doe he mean  and who are you   my name is hutton  said the short  stout man   and i am  well  one of those whose busi it is to uphold this establish   my name is turnbul  said the other   i am one of those whose busi it is to tear it to the ground  the small doctor smile  and turnbul  s anger seem sudden to steadi him   but i don  t want to talk about that  he said  calm   i onli want to know what the master of this asylum realli mean  dr  hutton  s smile broke into a laugh which  short as it was  had the suspicion of a shake in it   i suppos you think that quit a simpl question  he said   i think it a plain question  said turnbul   and one that deserv a plain answer  whi did the master lock us up in a coupl of cupboard like jar of pickl for a mortal month  and whi doe he now let us walk free in the garden again   i understand  said hutton  with arch eyebrow   that your complaint is that you are now free to walk in the garden   my complaint is  said turnbul  stubborn   that if i am fit to walk freeli now  i have been as fit for the last month  no one has examin me  no one has come near me  your chief say that i am onli free becaus he has made other arrang  what are those arrang  the young man with the round face look down for a littl while and smoke reflect  the other and elder doctor had gone pace nervous by himself upon the lawn  at length the round face was lift again  and show two round blue eye with a certain frank in them   well  i don  t see that it can do ani harm to tell you know  he said   you were shut up just then becaus it was just dure that month that the master was bring off his big scheme  he was get his bill through parliament  and organ the new medic polic  but of cours you haven  t heard of all that  in fact  you weren  t meant to   heard of all what  ask the impati inquir   there  s a new law now  and the asylum power are great extend  even if you did escap now  ani policeman would take you up in the next town if you couldn  t show a certif of saniti from us   well  continu dr  hutton   the master describ befor both hous of parliament the real scientif object to all exist legisl about lunaci  as he veri truli said  the mistak was in suppos insan to be mere an except or an extrem  insan  like forget  is simpli a qualiti which enter more or less into all human be  and for practic purpos it is more necessari to know whose mind is realli trustworthi than whose has some accident taint  we have therefor revers the exist method  and peopl now have to prove that they are sane  in the first villag you enter  the villag constabl would notic that you were not wear on the left lapel of your coat the small pewter s which is now necessari to ani one who walk about beyond asylum bound or outsid asylum hour   you mean to say  said turnbul   that this was what the master of the asylum urg befor the hous of common  dr  hutton nod with graviti   and you mean to say  cri turnbul  with a vibrant snort   that that propos was pass in an assembl that call itself democrat  the doctor show his whole row of teeth in a smile   oh  the assembl call itself socialist now  he said   but we explain to them that this was a question for men of scienc  turnbul gave one stamp upon the gravel  then pull himself togeth  and resum   but whi should your infern head medicin  man lock us up in separ cell while he was turn england into a madhous  i  m not the prime minist  we  re not the hous of lord   he wasn  t afraid of the prime minist  repli dr  hutton   he isn  t afraid of the hous of lord  but   well  inquir turnbul  stamp again   he is afraid of you  said hutton  simpli   whi  didn  t you know  macian  who had not spoken yet  made one stride forward and stood with shake limb and shine eye   he was afraid  began evan  thick   you mean to say that we   i mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over  said hutton  calm   most certain you two were the onli peopl he ever was afraid of  then he ad in a low but not inaud voic   except one  whom he fear wors  and has buri deeper   come away  cri macian   this has to be thought about  turnbul follow him in silenc as he strode away  but just befor he vanish  turn and spoke again to the doctor   but what has got hold of peopl  he ask  abrupt   whi should all england have gone dotti on the mere subject of dotti  dr  hutton smile his open smile onc more and bow slight   as to that also  he repli   i don  t want to make you vain  turnbul swung round without a word  and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafag of the garden  they notic noth special about the scene  except that the garden seem more exquisit than ever in the deepen sunset  and that there seem to be mani more peopl  whether patient or attend  walk about in it  from behind the two black  coat doctor as they stood on the lawn anoth figur somewhat similar dress strode hurri past them  have also grizzl hair and an open flap frock  coat  both his decis step and dapper black array mark him out as anoth medic man  or at least a man in author  and as he pass turnbul the latter was arous by a strong impress of have seen the man somewher befor  it was no one that he knew well  yet he was certain that it was someon at whom he had at sometim or other look steadili  it was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemi  it arous neither irrit nor tender  yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great import in his life  turn and return  and make detour about the garden  he manag to studi the man  s face again and again  a moustach  somewhat militari face with a monocl  the sort of face that is aristocrat without be distinguish  turnbul could not rememb ani particular doctor in his decid healthi exist  was the man a long  lost uncl  or was he onli somebodi who had sat opposit him regular in a railway train  at that moment the man knock down his own eye  glass with a gestur of annoy  turnbul rememb the gestur  and the truth sprang up solid in front of him  the man with the moustach was cumberland vane  the london polic magistr befor whom he and macian had onc stood on their trial  the magistr must have been transfer to some other offici duti  to someth connect with the inspect of asylum  turnbul  s heart gave a leap of excit which was half hope  as a magistr mr  cumberland vane had been somewhat careless and shallow  but certain kind  and not inaccess to common sens so long as it was put to him in strict convent languag  he was at least an author of a more human and refresh sort than the crank with the wag beard or the fiend with the fork chin  he went straight up to the magistr  and said   good even  mr  vane  i doubt if you rememb me  cumberland vane screw the eye  glass into his scowl face for an instant  and then said curt but not uncivilli   yes  i rememb you  sir  assault or batteri  wasn  t it  a fellow broke your window  a tall fellow  mcsometh  case made rather a nois afterward   macian is the name  sir  said turnbul  respect   i have him here with me   eh  said vane veri sharpli   confound him  has he got anyth to do with this game   mr  vane  said turnbul  pacif   i will not pretend that either he or i act quit decor on that occas  you were veri lenient with us  and did not treat us as crimin when you veri well might  so i am sure you will give us your testimoni that  even if we were crimin  we are not lunat in ani legal or medic sens whatev  i am sure you will use your influenc for us   my influenc  repeat the magistr  with a slight start   i don  t quit understand you   i don  t know in what capac you

advis  your opinion must still  cumberland vane explod with a deton of oath  his face was transfigur with furi and contempt  and yet in some odd way he did not seem special angri with turnbul   but lord bless us and save us  he gasp  at length   i  m not here as an offici at all  i  m here as a patient  the curs pack of rat  catch chemist all say that i  ve lost my wit   you  cri turnbul with terribl emphasi   you  lost your wit  in the rush of his real astonish at this tower unreal turnbul almost ad   whi  you haven  t got ani to lose  but he fortun rememb the remain of his desper diplomaci   this can  t go on  he said  posit   men like macian and i may suffer unjust all our live  but a man like you must have influenc   there is onli one man who has ani influenc in england now  said vane  and his high voic fell to a sudden and convinc quietud   whom do you mean  ask turnbul   i mean that curs fellow with the long split chin  said the other   is it realli true  ask turnbul   that he has been allow to buy up and control such a lot  what put the countri into such a state  mr  cumberland vane laugh outright   what put the countri into such a state  he ask   whi  you did  when you were fool enough to agre to fight macian  after all  everybodi was readi to believ that the bank of england might paint itself pink with white spot   i don  t understand  answer turnbul   whi should you be surpris at my fight  i hope i have alway fought   well  said cumberland vane  airili   you didn  t believ in religion  you see  so we thought you were safe at ani rate  you went further in your languag than most of us want to go  no good in just hurt one  s mother  s feel  i think  but of cours we all knew you were right  and  realli  we reli on you   did you  said the editor of the atheist with a burst heart   i am sorri you did not tell me so at the time  he walk away veri rapid and flung himself on a garden seat  and for some six minut his own wrong hid from him the huge and hilari fact that cumberland vane had been lock up as a lunat  the garden of the madhous was so perfect plan  and answer so exquisit to everi hour of daylight  that one could almost fanci that the sunlight was caught there tangl in it tint tree  as the wise men of gotham tri to chain the spring to a bush  or it seem as if this iron paradis still kept it uniqu dawn or it special sunset while the rest of the earth globe roll through it ordinari hour  there was one even  or late afternoon  in particular  which evan macian will rememb in the last moment of death  it was what artist call a daffodil sky  but it is coarsen even by refer to a daffodil  it was of that innoc lone yellow which has never heard of orang  though it might turn quit unconsci into green  against it the top  one might say the turret  of the clipt and order tree were outlin in that shade of veil violet which tint the top of lavend  a white earli moon was hard traceabl upon that delic yellow  macian  i say  will rememb this tender and transpar even  part becaus of it virgin gold and silver  and part becaus he pass beneath it through the most horribl instant of his life  turnbul was sit on his seat on the lawn  and the golden even impress even his posit natur  as inde it might have impress the oxen in a field  he was shock out of his idl mood of awe by see macian break from behind the bush and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man befor  with all his experi of the eccentr humour of this celt  macian fell on the bench  shake it so that it rattl  and grip it with his knee like one in dread pain of bodi  that particular run and tumbl is typic onli of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incur evil  who is bitten by a viper or condemn to be hang  turnbul look up in the white face of his friend and enemi  and almost turn cold at what he saw there  he had seen the blue but gloomi eye of the western highland troubl by as mani tempest as his own west highland sea  but there had alway been a fix star of faith behind the storm  now the star had gone out  and there was onli miseri  yet macian had the strength to answer the question where turnbul  taken by surpris  had not the strength to ask it   they are right  they are right  he cri   o my god  they are right  turnbul  i ought to be here  he went on with shapeless fluenci as if he no longer had the heart to choos or check his speech   i suppos i ought to have guess long ago  all my big dream and scheme  and everyon be against us  but i was stuck up  you know   do tell me about it  realli  cri the atheist  and  face with the furnac of the other  s pain  he did not notic that he spoke with the affect of a father   i am mad  turnbul  said evan  with a dead clear of speech  and leant back against the garden seat   nonsens  said the other  clutch at the obvious cue of benevol brutal   this is one of your silli mood  macian shook his head   i know enough about myself  he said   to allow for ani mood  though it open heaven or hell  but to see thing  to see them walk solid in the sun  thing that can  t be there  real mystic never do that  turnbul   what thing  ask the other  incredul  macian lower his voic   i saw her  he said   three minut ago  walk here in this hell yard  between tri to look scorn and realli look startl  turnbul  s face was confus enough to emit no speech  and evan went on in monoton sincer   i saw her walk behind those bless tree against that holi sky of gold as plain as i can see her whenev i shut my eye  i did shut them  and open them again  and she was still there  that is  of cours  she wasn  t  she still had a littl fur round her neck  but her dress was a shade brighter than when i realli saw her   my dear fellow  cri turnbul  ralli a hearti laugh   the fanci have realli got hold of you  you mistook some other poor girl here for her   mistook some other  said macian  and word fail him altogeth  they sat for some moment in the mellow silenc of the even garden  a silenc that was stifl for the sceptic  but utter empti and final for the man of faith  at last he broke out again with the word   well  anyhow  if i  m mad  i  m glad i  m mad on that  turnbul murmur some clumsi deprec  and sat stolid smoke to collect his thought  the next instant he had all his nerv engag in the mere effort to sit still  across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilex  tree there pass a slim  dark figur  a profil and the pois of a dark head like a bird  s  which realli pin him to his seat with the point of coincid  with an effort he got to his feet  and said with a voic of affect insouci   by georg  macian  she is uncommon like   what  cri macian  with a leap of eager that was heart  break   do you see her  too  and the blaze came back into the centr of his eye  turnbul  s tawni eyebrow were pull togeth with a peculiar frown of curios  and all at onc he walk quick across the lawn  macian sat rigid  but peer after him with open and parch lip  he saw the sight which either prove him sane or prove the whole univers half  wit  he saw the man of flesh approach that beauti phantom  saw their gestur of recognit  and saw them against the sunset join hand  he could stand it no longer  but ran across to the path  turn the corner and saw stand quit palpabl in the even sunlight  talk with a casual grace to turnbul  the face and figur which had fill his midnight with fright vivid or desper half  forgotten featur  she advanc quit pleasant and coolli  and put out her hand  the moment that he touch it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazi  she was entir eleg and unembarrass  that is the aw thing about women  they refus to be emot at emot moment  upon some such ludicr pretext as there be someon els there  but macian was in a condit of critic much less than the averag masculin one  be in fact mere overturn by the rush riddl of the event  evan doe not know to this day what particular question he ask  but he vivid rememb that she answer  and everi line or fluctuat of her face as she said it   oh  don  t you know  she said  smile  and sudden lift her level brown eyebrow

her featur  and repli with equal digniti   well  if it come to that  whi are you  the fact that turnbul had stroll away and was investig rhododendron may have been due to evan  s success prayer to the

the onli exist case of perdinavit   but this won  t do  doctor  said turnbul  almost tear his hair   this realli won  t do  the man realli did lose a ship  inde  not to put too fine a point on it  i took his ship  dr  quayl swung round for an instant so that his silk  line overcoat rustl  and stare singular at turnbul  then he said with hurri amiabl   whi  of cours you did  quit so  quit so  and

macian  just as a husband  even a bad husband  will run rage to find his wife if he is full of a furious queri  he found macian stalk moodili about the half  lit garden  after his extraordinari meet with beatric  no one who saw his slouch stride and sunken head could have known that his soul was in the seventh heaven of ecstasi  he did not think  he did not even veri definit desir  he mere wallow in memori  chiefli in materi memori  word said with a certain cadenc or trivial turn of the neck or wrist  into the middl of his stationari and senseless enjoy were thrust abrupt the project elbow and the project red beard of turnbul  macian step back a littl  and the soul in his eye came veri slowli to it window  when jame turnbul had the glitter sword  point plant upon his breast he was in far less danger  for three pulsat second after the interrupt macian was in a mood to have murder his father  and yet his whole emot anger fell from him when he saw turnbul  s face  in which the eye seem to be burst from the head like bullet  all the fire and fragranc even of young and honour love fade for a moment befor that stiff agoni of interrog   are you hurt  turnbul  he ask  anxious   i am die  answer the other quit calm   i am in the quit liter sens of the word die to know someth  i want to know what all this can possibl mean  macian did not answer  and he continu with asper   you are still think about that girl  but i tell you the whole thing is incred  she  s not the onli person here  i  ve met the fellow wilkinson  whose yacht we lost  i  ve met the veri magistr you were haul up to when you broke my window  what can it mean  meet all these old peopl again  one never meet such old friend again except in a dream  then after a silenc he cri with a rend sincer   are you realli there  evan  have you ever been realli there  am i simpli dream  macian had been listen with a live silenc to everi word  and now his face flame with one of his rare revel of life   no  you good atheist  he cri   no  you clean  courteous  rever  pious old blasphem  no  you are not dream  you are wake up   what do you mean   there are two state where one meet so mani old friend  said macian   one is a dream  the other is the end of the world   and you say   i say this is not a dream  said evan in a ring voic   you realli mean to suggest  began turnbul   be silent  or i shall say it all wrong  said macian  breath hard   it  s hard to explain  anyhow  an apocalyps is the opposit of a dream  a dream is falser than the outer life  but the end of the world is more actual than the world it end  i don  t say this is realli the end of the world  but it  s someth like that  it  s the end of someth  all the peopl are crowd into one corner  everyth is come to a point   what is the point  ask turnbul   i can  t see it  said evan   it is too larg and plain  then after a silenc he said   i can  t see it  and yet i will tri to describ it  turnbul  three day ago i saw quit sudden that our duel was not right after all   three day ago  repeat turnbul   when and whi did this illumin occur   i knew i was not quit right  answer evan   the moment i saw the round eye of that old man in the cell   old man in the cell  repeat his wonder companion   do you mean the poor old idiot who like spike to stick out   yes  said macian  after a slight paus   i mean the poor old idiot who like spike to stick out  when i saw his eye and heard his old croak accent  i knew that it would not realli have been right to kill you  it would have been a venial sin   i am much oblig  said turnbul  gruffli   you must give me time  said macian  quit patient   for i am tri to tell the whole truth  i am tri to tell more of it than i know   so you see i confess  he went on with labori distinct   i confess that all the peopl who call our duel mad were right in a way  i would confess it to old cumberland vane and his eye  glass  i would confess it even to that old ass in brown flannel who talk to us about love  yes  they are right in a way  i am a littl mad  he stop and wipe his brow as if he were liter do heavi labour  then he went on   i am a littl mad  but  after all  it is onli a littl mad  when hundr of high  mind men had fought duesl about a jostl with the elbow or the ace of spade  the whole world need not have gone wild over my one littl wild  plenti of other peopl have kill themselv between then and now  but all england has gone into captiv in order to take us captiv  all england has turn into a lunat asylum in order to prove us lunat  compar with the general public  i might posit be call sane  he stop again  and went on with the same air of travail with the truth   when i saw that  i saw everyth  i saw the church and the world  the church in it earth action has realli touch morbid thing  tortur and bleed vision and blast of extermin  the church has had her mad  and i am one of them  i am the massacr of st  bartholomew  i am the inquisit of spain  i do not say that we have never gone mad  but i say that we are fit to act as keeper to our enemi  massacr is wick even with a provoc  as in the bartholomew  but your modern nietzsch will tell you that massacr would be glorious without a provoc  tortur should be violent stop  though the church is do it  but your modern tolstoy will tell you that it ought not to be violent stop whoever is do it  in the long run  which is most mad  the church or the world  which is madder  the spanish priest who permit tyranni  or the prussian sophist who admir it  which is madder  the russian priest who discourag righteous rebellion  or the russian novelist who forbid it  that is the final and blast test  the world left to itself grow wilder than ani creed  a few day ago you and i were the maddest peopl in england  now  by god  i believ we are the sanest  that is the onli real question  whether the church is realli madder than the world  let the rationalist run their own race  and let us see where they end  if the world has some healthi balanc other than god  let the world find it  doe the world find it  cut the world loos  he cri with a savag gestur   doe the world stand on it own end  doe it stand  or doe it stagger  turnbul remain silent  and macian said to him  look onc more at the earth   it stagger  turnbul  it cannot stand by itself  you know it cannot  it has been the sorrow of your life  turnbul  this garden is not a dream  but an apocalypt fulfil  this garden is the world gone mad  turnbul did not move his head  and he had been listen all the time  yet  somehow  the other knew that for the first time he was listen serious   the world has gone mad  said macian   and it has gone mad about us  the world take the troubl to make a big mistak about everi littl mistak made by the church  that is whi they have turn ten counti to a madhous  that is whi crowd of kind peopl are pour into this filthi melt  pot  now is the judgement of this world  the princ of this world is judg  and he is judg exact becaus he is judg  there is at last one simpl solut to the quarrel between the ball and the cross  turnbul for the first time start   the ball and  he repeat   what is the matter with you  ask macian   i had a dream  said turnbul  thick and obscur   in which i saw the cross struck crook and the ball secur   i had a dream  said macian   in which i saw the cross erect and the ball invis  they were both dream from hell  there must be some round earth to plant the cross upon  but here is the aw differ  that the round world will not consent even to continu round  the astronom are alway tell us that it is shape like an orang  or like an egg  or like a german sausag  they beat the old world about like a bladder and thump it into a thousand shapeless shape  turnbul  we cannot trust the ball to be alway a ball  we cannot trust reason to be reason  in the end the great terrestri globe will go quit lop  side  and onli the cross will stand upright  there was a long silenc  and then turnbul said  hesit   has it occur to you that sinc  sinc those two dream  or whatev they were   well  murmur macian   sinc then  went on turnbul  in the same low voic   sinc then we have never even look for our sword   you are right  answer evan almost inaud   we have found someth which we both hate more than we ever hate each other  and i think i know it name  turnbul seem to frown and flinch for a moment   it doe not much matter what you call it  he said   so long as you keep out of it way  the bush broke and snap abrupt behind them  and a veri tall figur tower abov turnbul with an arrog stoop and a project chin  a chin of which the shape show queer even in it shadow upon the path   you see that is not so easi  said macian between his teeth  they look up into the eye of the master  but look onli for a moment  the eye were full of a frozen and ici wrath  a kind of utter heartless hatr  his voic was for the first time devoid of ironi  there was no more sarcasm in it than there is in an iron club   you will be insid the build in three minut  he said  with pulver precis   or you will be fire on by the artilleri at all the window  there is too much talk in this garden  we intend to close it  you will be accommod indoor   ah  said macian  with a long and satisfi sigh   then i was right  and he turn his back and walk obedi toward the build  turnbul seem to canvass for a few minut the notion of knock the master down  and then fell under the same almost fairi fatal as his companion  in some strang way it did seem that the more smooth they yield  the more swift would event sweep on to some great collis  xx  die ira as they advanc toward the asylum they look up at it row on row of window  and understood the master  s materi threat  by mean of that complex but conceal machineri which ran like a network of nerv over the whole fabric  there had been shot out under everi window  ledg row and row of polish  steel cylind  the cold miracl of modern gunneri  they command the whole garden and the whole countri  side  and could have blown to piec an armi corp  this silent declar of war had evid had it complet effect  as macian and turnbul walk steadili but slowli toward the entranc hall of the institut  they could see that most  or at least mani  of the patient had alreadi gather there as well as the staff of doctor and the whole regiment of keeper and assist  but when they enter the lamp  lit hall  and the high iron door was clash to and lock behind them  yet a new amaz leapt into their eye  and the stalwart turnbul almost fell  for he saw a sight which was inde  as macian had said  either the day of judgement or a dream  within a few feet of him at one corner of the squar of stand peopl stood the girl he had known in jersey  madelein durand  she look straight at him with a steadi smile which lit up the scene of dark and unreason like the light of some honest firesid  her squar face and throat were thrown back  as her habit was  and there was someth almost sleepi in the genial of her eye  he saw her first  and for a few second saw her onli  then the outer edg of his eyesight took in all the other stare face  and he saw all the face he had ever seen for week and month past  there was the tolstoyan in jaeger flannel  with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eye that went forward  with the curios of a crank  he was talk eager to mr  gordon  the corpul jew shopkeep whom they had onc gag in his own shop  there was the tipsi old hertfordshir rustic  he was talk energet to himself  there was not onli mr  vane the magistr  but the clerk of mr  vane  the magistr  there was not onli miss drake of the motor  car  but also miss drake  s chauffeur  noth wild or unfamiliar could have produc upon turnbul such a nightmar impress as that ring of familiar face  yet he had one intellectu shock which was greater than all the other  he step impuls forward toward madelein  and then waver with a kind of wild humil  as he did so he caught sight of anoth squar face behind madelein  s  a face with long grey whisker and an auster stare  it was old durand  the girl  father  and when turnbul saw him he saw the last and worst marvel of that monstrous night  he rememb durand  he rememb his monoton  everlast lucid  his stupefi sensibl view of everyth  his coloss content with truism mere becaus they were true   confound it all  cri turnbul to himself   if he is in the asylum  there can  t be anyon outsid  he drew nearer to madelein  but still doubt and all the more so becaus she still smile at him  macian had alreadi gone across to beatric with an air of fright  then all these bewild but part amic recognit were cloven by a cruel voic which alway made all human blood turn bitter  the master was stand in the middl of the room survey the scene like a great artist look at a complet pictur  handsom as he look  they had never seen so clear what was realli hate in his face  and even then they could onli express it by say that the arch brow and the long emphat chin gave it alway a look of be lit from below  like the face of some infern actor   this is inde a cosi parti  he said  with glitter eye  the master evid meant to say more  but befor he could say anyth m  durand had step right up to him and was speak  he was speak exact as a french bourgeoi speak to the manag of a restaur  that is  he spoke with rattl and breathless rapid  but with no incoher  and therefor with no emot  it was a steadi  monoton vivac  which came not seem from passion  but mere from the reason have been sent off at a gallop  he was say someth like this   you refus me my half  bottl of medoc  the drink the most wholesom and the most customari  you refus me the compani and obedi of my daughter  which natur herself indic  you refus me the beef and mutton  without pretenc that it is a fast of the church  you now forbid me the promenad  a thing necessari to a person of my age  it is useless to tell me that you do all this by law  law rest upon the social contract  if the citizen find himself despoil of such pleasur and power as he would have had even in the savag state  the social contract is annul   it  s no good chatter away  monsieur  said hutton  for the master was silent   the place is cover with machin  gun  we  ve got to obey our order  and so have you   the machineri is of the most perfect  assent durand  somewhat irrelev   work by petroleum  i believ  i onli ask you to admit that if such thing fall below the comfort of barbar  the social contract is annul  it is a pretti littl point of theori   oh  i dare say  said hutton  durand bow quit civilli and withdrew   a cosi parti  resum the master  scorn   and yet i believ some of you are in doubt about how we all came togeth  i will explain it  ladi and gentlemen  i will explain everyth  to whom shall i special address myself  to mr  jame turnbul  he has a scientif mind  turnbul seem to choke with sudden protest  the master seem onli to cough out of pure polit and proceed   mr  turnbul will agre with me  he said   when i say that we long felt in scientif circl that great harm was done by such a legend as that of the crucifixion  turnbul growl someth which was presum assent  the master went on smooth   it was in vain for us to urg that the incid was irrelev  that there were mani such fanat  mani such execut  we were forc to take the thing thorough in hand  to investig it in the spirit of scientif histori  and with the assist of mr  turnbul and other we were happi in be abl to announc that this alleg crucifixion never occur at all  macian lift his head and look at the master steadili  but turnbul did not look up   this  we found  was the onli way with all superstit  continu the speaker   it was necessari to deni them histor  and we have done it with great success in the case of miracl and such thing  now within our own time there aros an unfortun fuss which threaten  as mr  turnbul would say  to galvan the corps of christian into a fictiti life  the alleg case of a highland eccentr who want to fight for the virgin  macian  quit white  made a step forward  but the speaker did not alter his easi attitud or his flow of word   again we urg that this duel was not to be admir  that it was a mere brawl  but the peopl were ignor and romant  there were sign of treat this alleg highland and his alleg oppon as hero  we tri all other mean of arrest this reactionari hero worship  work men who bet on the duel were imprison for gambl  work men who drank the health of a duellist were imprison for drunken  but the popular excit about the alleg duel continu  and we had to fall back on our old histor method  we investig  on scientif principl  the stori of macian  s challeng  and we are happi to be abl to inform you that the whole stori of the attempt duel is a fabl  there never was ani challeng  there never was ani man name macian  it is a melodramat myth  like calvari  not a soul move save turnbul  who lift his head  yet there was the sens of a silent explos   the whole stori of the macian challeng  went on the master  beam at them all with a sinist benign   has been found to origin in the obsess of a few patholog type  who are now all fortun in our care  there is  for instanc  a person here of the name of gordon  former the keeper of a curios shop  he is a victim of the diseas call vinculomania  the impress that one has been bound or tie up  we have also a case of fugac  mr  whimpey  who imagin that he was chase by two men  the indign face of the jew shopkeep and the magdalen don start out of the crowd in their indign  but the speaker continu   one poor woman we have with us  he said  in a compassion voic   believ she was in a motor  car with two such men  this is the well  known illus of speed on which i need not dwell  anoth wretch woman has the simpl egotist mania that she has caus the duel  madelein durand actual profess to have been the subject of the fight between macian and his enemi  a fight which  if it occur at all  certain began long befor  but it never occur at all  we have taken in hand everi person who profess to have seen such a thing  and prove them all to be unbalanc  that is whi they are here  the master look round the room  just show his perfect teeth with the perfect of artist cruelti  exalt for a moment in the enorm simplic of his success  and then walk across the hall and vanish through an inner door  his two lieuten  quayl and hutton  were left stand at the head of the great armi of servant and keeper   i hope we shall have no more troubl  said dr  quayl pleasant enough  and address turnbul  who was lean heavili upon the back of a chair  still look down  turnbul lift the chair an inch or two from the ground  then he sudden swung it abov his head and sent it at the inquir doctor with an aw crash which sent one of it wooden leg loos along the floor and cram the doctor gasp into a corner  macian gave a great shout  snatch up the loos chair  leg  and  rush on the other doctor  fell him with a blow  twenti attend rush to captur the rebel  macian flung back three of them and turnbul went over on top of one  when from behind them all came a shriek as of someth quit fresh and fright  two of the three passag lead out of the hall were choke with blue smoke  anoth instant and the hall was full of the fog of it  and red spark began to swarm like scarlet bee   the place is on fire  cri quayl with a scream of indec terror   oh  who can have done it  how can it have happen  a light had come into turnbul  s eye   how did the french revolut happen  he ask   oh  how should i know  wail the other   then i will tell you  said turnbul   it happen becaus some peopl fanci that a french grocer was as respect as he look  even as he spoke  as if by confirm  old mr  durand re  enter the smoki room quit placid  wipe the petroleum from his hand with a handkerchief  he had set fire to the build in accord with the strict principl of the social contract  but macian had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terribl   now  he cri  pant   now is the judgement of the world  the doctor will leav this place  the keeper will leav this place  they will leav us in charg of the machineri and the machin  gun at the window  but we  the lunat  will wait to be burn aliv if onli we may see them go   how do you know we shall go  ask hutton  fierc   you believ

thing which is complet healthi   you think the doctor will go  said hutton  savag   the keeper have gone alreadi  said turnbul  even as they spoke the main door were burst open in mere brutal panic  and all the offic and subordin of the asylum rush away across the garden pursu by the smoke  but among the ticket maniac not a man or woman move   we hate die  said turnbul  with composur   but we hate you even more  this is a success revolut  in the roof abov their head a panel shot back  show a strip of star  lit sky and a huge thing made of white metal  with the shape and fin of a fish  swing as if at anchor  at the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the open and struck the floor  and the cleft chin of the mysteri master was thrust into the open   quayl  hutton  he said   you will escap with me  and they went up the ladder like automata of lead  long after they had clamber into the car  the creatur with the cloven face continu to leer down upon the smoke  stung crowd below  then at last he said in a silken voic and with a smile of final satisfact   by the way  i fear i am veri absent mind  there is one man special whom  somehow  i alway forget  i alway leav him lie about  onc i mislaid him on the cross of st  paul  s  so silli of me  and now i  ve forgotten him in one of those littl cell where your fire is burn  veri unfortun  especi for him  and nod genial  he climb into his fli ship  macian stood motionless for two minut  and then rush down one of the suffoc corridor till he found the flame  turnbul look onc at madelein  and follow     macian  with sing

spot where the old man lay dead or aliv  not now through dark  but through scorch and ach light  the site of the old half  wit  s cell was now the heart of a stand forest of fire  the flame as thick and yellow as a cornfield  their incess shriek and crackl was like a mob shout against an orat  yet through all that deafen densiti macian thought he heard a small and separ sound  when he heard it he rush forward as if to plung into that furnac  but turnbul arrest him by an elbow   let me go  cri evan  in agoni   it  s the poor old beggar  s voic  he  s still aliv  and shout for help   listen  said turnbul  and lift one finger from his clench hand   or els he is shriek with pain  protest macian   i will not endur it   listen  repeat turnbul  grim   did you ever hear anyon shout for help or

then the whole of one half of it lean one way as a cornfield lean all one way under the load of the wind  inde  it look as if a great wind had sprung up and driven the great fire aslant  it smoke was no longer sent up to choke the star  but was trail and drag across counti after counti like one dread banner of defeat  but it was not the wind  or  if it was the wind  it was two wind blow in opposit
