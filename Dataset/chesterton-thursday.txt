 the man who was thursday by g  k  chesterton 1908  to edmund clerihew bentley a cloud was on the mind of men  and wail went the weather  yea  a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boy togeth  scienc announc nonent and art admir decay  the world was old and end  but you and i were gay  round us in antic order their crippl vice came  lust that had lost it laughter  fear that had lost it shame  like the white lock of whistler  that lit our aimless gloom  men show their own white feather as proud as a plume  life was a fli that fade  and death a drone that stung  the world was veri old inde when you and i were young  they twist even decent sin to shape not to be name  men were asham of honour  but we were not asham  weak if we were and foolish  not thus we fail  not thus  when that black baal block the heaven he had no hymn from us children we were  our fort of sand were even as weak as eve  high as they went we pile them up to break that bitter sea  fool as we were in motley  all jangl and absurd  when all church bell were silent our cap and bed were heard  not all unhelp we held the fort  our tini flag unfurl  some giant labour in that cloud to lift it from the world  i find again the book we found  i feel the hour that fling far out of fish  shape paumanok some cri of cleaner thing  and the green carnat wither  as in forest fire that pass  roar in the wind of all the world ten million leav of grass  or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sing in the rain  truth out of tusitala spoke and pleasur out of pain  yea  cool and clear and sudden as a bird sing in the grey  dunedin to samoa spoke  and dark unto day  but we were young  we live to see god break their bitter charm  god and the good republ come ride back in arm  we have seen the citi of mansoul  even as it rock  reliev  bless are they who did not see  but be blind  believ  this is a tale of those old fear  even of those empti hell  and none but you shall understand the true thing that it tell  of what coloss god of shame could cow men and yet crash  of what huge devil hid the star  yet fell at a pistol flash  the doubt that were so plain to chase  so dread to withstand  oh  who shall understand but you  yea  who shall understand  the doubt that drove us through the night as we two talk amain  and day had broken on the street e  er it broke upon the brain  between us  by the peac of god  such truth can now be told  yea  there is strength in strike root and good in grow old  we have found common thing at last and marriag and a creed  and i may safe write it now  and you may safe read  g  k  c  chapter i the two poet of saffron park the suburb of saffron park lay on the sunset side of london  as red and rag as a cloud of sunset  it was built of a bright brick throughout  it sky  line was fantast  and even it ground plan was wild  it had been the outburst of a specul builder  faint ting with art  who call it architectur sometim elizabethan and sometim queen ann  appar under the impress that the two sovereign were ident  it was describ with some justic as an artist coloni  though it never in ani defin way produc ani art  but although it pretens to be an intellectu centr were a littl vagu  it pretens to be a pleasant place were quit indisput  the stranger who look for the first time at the quaint red hous could onli think how veri odd shape the peopl must be who could fit in to them  nor when he met the peopl was he disappoint in this respect  the place was not onli pleasant  but perfect  if onc he could regard it not as a decept but rather as a dream  even if the peopl were not  artist  the whole was nevertheless artist  that young man with the long  auburn hair and the impud face  that young man was not realli a poet  but sure he was a poem  that old gentleman with the wild  white beard and the wild  white hat  that vener humbug was not realli a philosoph  but at least he was the caus of philosophi in other  that scientif gentleman with the bald  egg  like head and the bare  bird  like neck had no real right to the air of scienc that he assum  he had not discov anyth new in biolog  but what biolog creatur could he have discov more singular than himself  thus  and thus onli  the whole place had proper to be regard  it had to be consid not so much as a workshop for artist  but as a frail but finish work of art  a man who step into it social atmospher felt as if he had step into a written comedi  more especi this attract unreal fell upon it about nightfal  when the extravag roof were dark against the afterglow and the whole insan villag seem as separ as a drift cloud  this again was more strong true of the mani night of local festiv  when the littl garden were often illumin  and the big chines lantern glow in the dwarfish tree like some fierc and monstrous fruit  and this was strongest of all on one particular even  still vagu rememb in the local  of which the auburn  hair poet was the hero  it was not by ani mean the onli even of which he was the hero  on mani night those pass by his littl back garden might hear his high  didact voic lay down the law to men and particular to women  the attitud of women in such case was inde one of the paradox of the place  most of the women were of the kind vagu call emancip  and profess some protest against male supremaci  yet these new women would alway pay to a man the extravag compliment which no ordinari woman ever pay to him  that of listen while he is talk  and mr  lucian gregori  the red  hair poet  was realli  in some sens  a man worth listen to  even if one onli laugh at the end of it  he put the old cant of the lawless of art and the art of lawless with a certain impud fresh which gave at least a momentari pleasur  he was help in some degre by the arrest odditi of his appear  which he work  as the phrase goe  for all it was worth  his dark red hair part in the middl was liter like a woman  s  and curv into the slow curl of a virgin in a pre  raphaelit pictur  from within this almost saint oval  howev  his face project sudden broad and brutal  the chin carri forward with a look of cockney contempt  this combin at onc tickl and terrifi the nerv of a neurot popul  he seem like a walk blasphemi  a blend of the angel and the ape  this particular even  if it is rememb for noth els  will be rememb in that place for it strang sunset  it look like the end of the world  all the heaven seem cover with a quit vivid and palpabl plumag  you could onli say that the sky was full of feather  and of feather that almost brush the face  across the great part of the dome they were grey  with the strangest tint of violet and mauv and an unnatur pink or pale green  but toward the west the whole grew past descript  transpar and passion  and the last red  hot plume of it cover up the sun like someth too good to be seen  the whole was so close about the earth  as to express noth but a violent secreci  the veri empyrean seem to be a secret  it express that splendid small which is the soul of local patriot  the veri sky seem small  i say that there are some inhabit who may rememb the even if onli by that oppress sky  there are other who may rememb it becaus it mark the first appear in the place of the second poet of saffron park  for a long time the red  hair revolutionari had reign without a rival  it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitud sudden end  the new poet  who introduc himself by the name of gabriel syme was a veri mild  look mortal  with a fair  point beard and faint  yellow hair  but an impress grew that he was less meek than he look  he signalis his entranc by differ with the establish poet  gregori  upon the whole natur of poetri  he said that he  syme  was poet of law  a poet of order  nay  he said he was a poet of respect  so all the saffron parker look at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that imposs sky  in fact  mr  lucian gregori  the anarch poet  connect the two event   it may well be  he said  in his sudden lyric manner   it may well be on such a night of cloud and cruel colour that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respect poet  you say you are a poet of law  i say you are a contradict in term  i onli wonder there were not comet and earthquak on the night you appear in this garden  the man with the meek blue eye and the pale  point beard endur these thunder with a certain submiss solemn  the third parti of the group  gregori  s sister rosamond  who had her brother  s braid of red hair  but a kindlier face underneath them  laugh with such mixtur of admir and disapprov as she gave common to the famili oracl  gregori resum in high orator good humour   an artist is ident with an anarchist  he cri   you might transpos the word anywher  an anarchist is an artist  the man who throw a bomb is an artist  becaus he prefer a great moment to everyth  he see how much more valuabl is one burst of blaze light  one peal of perfect thunder  than the mere common bodi of a few shapeless policemen  an artist disregard all govern  abolish all convent  the poet delight in disord onli  if it were not so  the most poetic thing in the world would be the underground railway   so it is  said mr  syme   nonsens  said gregori  who was veri ration when anyon els attempt paradox   whi do all the clerk and navvi in the railway train look so sad and tire  so veri sad and tire  i will tell you  it is becaus they know that the train is go right  it is becaus they know that whatev place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach  it is becaus after they have pass sloan squar they know that the next station must be victoria  and noth but victoria  oh  their wild raptur  oh  their eye like star and their soul again in eden  if the next station were unaccount baker street   it is you who are unpoet  repli the poet syme   if what you say of clerk is true  they can onli be as prosaic as your poetri  the rare  strang thing is to hit the mark  the gross  obvious thing is to miss it  we feel it is epic when man with one wild arrow strike a distant bird  is it not also epic when man with one wild engin strike a distant station  chao is dull  becaus in chao the train might inde go anywher  to baker street or to bagdad  but man is a magician  and his whole magic is in this  that he doe say victoria  and lo  it is victoria  no  take your book of mere poetri and prose  let me read a time tabl  with tear of pride  take your byron  who commemor the defeat of man  give me bradshaw  who commemor his victori  give me bradshaw  i say   must you go  inquir gregori sarcast   i tell you  went on syme with passion   that everi time a train come in i feel that it has broken past batteri of besieg  and that man has won a battl against chao  you say contemptu that when one has left sloan squar one must come to victoria  i say that one might do a thousand thing instead  and that whenev i realli come there i have the sens of hairbreadth escap  and when i hear the guard shout out the word  victoria  it is not an unmean word  it is to me the cri of a herald announc conquest  it is to me inde  victoria  it is the victori of adam  gregori wag his heavi  red head with a slow and sad smile   and even then  he said   we poet alway ask the question   and what is victoria now that you have got there  you think victoria is like the new jerusalem  we know that the new jerusalem will onli be like victoria  yes  the poet will be discont even in the street of heaven  the poet is alway in revolt   there again  said syme irrit   what is there poetic about be in revolt  you might as well say that it is poetic to be sea  sick  be sick is a revolt  both be sick and be rebelli may be the wholesom thing on certain desper occas  but i  m hang if i can see whi they are poetic  revolt in the abstract is  revolt  it  s mere vomit  the girl winc for a flash at the unpleas word  but syme was too hot to heed her   it is thing go right  he cri   that is poetic i our digest  for instanc  go sacr and silent right  that is the foundat of all poetri  yes  the most poetic thing  more poetic than the flower  more poetic than the star  the most poetic thing in the world is not be sick   realli  said gregori supercili   the exampl you choos   i beg your pardon  said syme grim   i forgot we had abolish all convent  for the first time a red patch appear on gregori  s forehead   you don  t expect me  he said   to revolutionis societi on this lawn  syme look straight into his eye and smile sweet   no  i don  t  he said   but i suppos that if you were serious about your anarch  that is exact what you would do  gregori  s big bull  s eye blink sudden like those of an angri lion  and one could almost fanci that his red mane rose   don  t you think  then  he said in a danger voic   that i am serious about my anarch   i beg your pardon  said syme   am i not serious about my anarch  cri gregori  with knot fist   my dear fellow  said syme  and stroll away  with surpris  but with a curious pleasur  he found rosamond gregori still in his compani   mr  syme  she said   do the peopl who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say  do you mean what you say now  syme smile   do you  he ask   what do you mean  ask the girl  with grave eye   my dear miss gregori  said syme gentl   there are mani kind of sincer and insincer  when you say  thank you  for the salt  do you mean what you say  no  when you say  the world is round  do you mean what you say  no  it is true  but you don  t mean it  now  sometim a man like your brother realli find a thing he doe mean  it may be onli a half  truth  quarter  truth  tenth  truth  but then he say more than he mean  from sheer forc of mean it  she was look at him from under level brow  her face was grave and open  and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreason respons which is at the bottom of the most frivol woman  the matern watch which is as old as the world   is he realli an anarchist  then  she ask   onli in that sens i speak of  repli syme   or if you prefer it  in that nonsens  she drew her broad brow togeth and said abrupt   he wouldn  t realli use  bomb or that sort of thing  syme broke into a great laugh  that seem too larg for his slight and somewhat dandifi figur   good lord  no  he said   that has to be done anonym  and at that the corner of her own mouth broke into a smile  and she thought with a simultan pleasur of gregori  s absurd and of his safeti  syme stroll with her to a seat in the corner of the garden  and continu to pour out his opinion  for he was a sincer man  and in spite of his superfici air and grace  at root a humbl one  and it is alway the humbl man who talk too much  the proud man watch himself too close  he defend respect with violenc and exagger  he grew passion in his prais of tidi and proprieti  all the time there was a smell of lilac all round him  onc he heard veri faint in some distant street a barrel  organ begin to play  and it seem to him that his heroic word were move to a tini tune from under or beyond the world  he stare and talk at the girl  s red hair and amus face for what seem to be a few minut  and then  feel that the group in such a place should mix  rose to his feet  to his astonish  he discov the whole garden empti  everyon had gone long ago  and he went himself with a rather hurri apolog  he left with a sens of champagn in his head  which he could not afterward explain  in the wild event which were to follow this girl had no part at all  he never saw her again until all his tale was over  and yet  in some indescrib way  she kept recur like a motiv in music through all his mad adventur afterward  and the glori of her strang hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill  drawn tapestri of the night  for what follow was so improb  that it might well have been a dream  when syme went out into the starlit street  he found it for the moment empti  then he realis  in some odd way  that the silenc was rather a live silenc than a dead one  direct outsid the door stood a street lamp  whose gleam gild the leav of the tree that bent out over the fenc behind him  about a foot from the lamp  post stood a figur almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp  post itself  the tall hat and long frock coat were black  the face  in an abrupt shadow  was almost as dark  onli a fring of fieri hair against the light  and also someth aggress in the attitud  proclaim that it was the poet gregori  he had someth of the look of a mask bravo wait sword in hand for his foe  he made a sort of doubt salut  which syme somewhat more formal return   i was wait for you  said gregori   might i have a moment  s convers   certain  about what  ask syme in a sort of weak wonder  gregori struck out with his stick at the lamp  post  and then at the tree   about this and this  he cri   about order and anarchi  there is your precious order  that lean  iron lamp  ugli and barren  and there is anarchi  rich  live  reproduc itself  there is anarchi  splendid in green and gold   all the same  repli syme patient   just at present you onli see the tree by the light of the lamp  i wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree  then after a paus he said   but may i ask if you have been stand out here in the dark onli to resum our littl argument   no  cri out gregori  in a voic that rang down the street   i did not stand here to resum our argument  but to end it for ever  the silenc fell again  and syme  though he understood noth  listen instinct for someth serious  gregori began in a smooth voic and with a rather bewild smile   mr  syme  he said   this even you succeed in do someth rather remark  you did someth to me that no man born of woman has ever succeed in do befor   inde   now i rememb  resum gregori reflect   one other person succeed in do it  the captain of a penni steamer  if i rememb correct  at southend  you have irrit me   i am veri sorri  repli syme with graviti   i am afraid my furi and your insult are too shock to be wipe out even with an apolog  said gregori veri calm   no duel could wipe it out  if i struck you dead i could not wipe it out  there is onli one way by which that insult can be eras  and that way i choos  i am go  at the possibl sacrific of my life and honour  to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said   in what i said   you said i was not serious about be an anarchist   there are degre of serious  repli syme   i have never doubt that you were perfect sincer in this sens  that you thought what you said well worth say  that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglect truth  gregori stare at him steadili and pain   and in no other sens  he ask   you think me serious  you think me a flaneur who let fall occasion truth  you do not think that in a deeper  a more dead sens  i am serious  syme struck his stick violent on the stone of the road   serious  he cri   good lord  is this street serious  are these damn chines lantern serious  is the whole caboodl serious  one come here and talk a pack of bosh  and perhap some sens as well  but i should think veri littl of a man who didn  t keep someth in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talk  someth more serious  whether it was religion or onli drink   veri well  said gregori  his face darken   you shall see someth more serious than either drink or religion  syme stood wait with his usual air of mild until gregori again open his lip   you spoke just now of have a religion  is it realli true that you have one   oh  said syme with a beam smile   we are all cathol now   then may i ask you to swear by whatev god or saint your religion involv that you will not reveal what i am now go to tell you to ani son of adam  and especi not to the polic  will you swear that  if you will take upon yourself this aw abneg if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledg you should never dream about  i will promis you in return   you will promis me in return  inquir syme  as the other paus   i will promis you a veri entertain even  syme sudden took off his hat   your offer  he said   is far too idiot to be declin  you say that a poet is alway an anarchist  i disagre  but i hope at least that he is alway a sportsman  permit me  here and now  to swear as a christian  and promis as a good comrad and a fellow  artist  that i will not report anyth of this  whatev it is  to the polic  and now  in the name of colney hatch  what is it   i think  said gregori  with placid irrelev   that we will call a cab  he gave two long whistl  and a hansom came rattl down the road  the two got into it in silenc  gregori gave through the trap the address of an obscur public  hous on the chiswick bank of the river  the cab whisk itself away again  and in it these two fantast quit their fantast town  chapter ii the secret of gabriel syme the cab pull up befor a particular dreari and greasi beershop  into which gregori rapid conduct his companion  they seat themselv in a close and dim sort of bar  parlour  at a stain wooden tabl with one wooden leg  the room was so small and dark  that veri littl could be seen of the attend who was summon  beyond a vagu and dark impress of someth bulki and beard   will you take a littl supper  ask gregori polit   the pate de foie gras is not good here  but i can recommend the game  syme receiv the remark with stolid  imagin it to be a joke  accept the vein of humour  he said  with a well  bred indiffer   oh  bring me some lobster mayonnais  to his indescrib astonish  the man onli said  certain  sir  and went away appar to get it   what will you drink  resum gregori  with the same careless yet apologet air   i shall onli have a crepe de menth myself  i have dine  but the champagn can realli be trust  do let me start you with a half  bottl of pommeri at least   thank you  said the motionless syme   you are veri good  his further attempt at convers  somewhat disorganis in themselv  were cut short final as by a thunderbolt by the actual appear of the lobster  syme tast it  and found it particular good  then he sudden began to eat with great rapid and appetit   excus me if i enjoy myself rather obvious  he said to gregori  smile   i don  t often have the luck to have a dream like this  it is new to me for a nightmar to lead to a lobster  it is common the other way   you are not asleep  i assur you  said gregori   you are  on the contrari  close to the most actual and rous moment of your exist  ah  here come your champagn  i admit that there may be a slight disproport  let us say  between the inner arrang of this excel hotel and it simpl and unpretenti exterior  but that is all our modesti  we are the most modest men that ever live on earth   and who are we  ask syme  empti his champagn glass   it is quit simpl  repli gregori   we are the serious anarchist  in whom you do not believ   oh  said syme short   you do yourselv well in drink   yes  we are serious about everyth  answer gregori  then after a paus he ad   if in a few moment this tabl begin to turn round a littl  don  t put it down to your inroad into the champagn  i don  t wish you to do yourself an injustic   well  if i am not drunk  i am mad  repli syme with perfect calm   but i trust i can behav like a gentleman in either condit  may i smoke   certain  said gregori  produc a cigar  case   tri one of mine  syme took the cigar  clip the end off with a cigar  cutter out of his waistcoat pocket  put it in his mouth  lit it slowli  and let out a long cloud of smoke  it is not a littl to his credit that he perform these rite with so much composur  for almost befor he had begun them the tabl at which he sat had begun to revolv  first slowli  and then rapid  as if at an insan seanc   you must not mind it  said gregori   it  s a kind of screw   quit so  said syme placid   a kind of screw  how simpl that is  the next moment the smoke of his cigar  which had been waver across the room in snaki twist  went straight up as if from a factori chimney  and the two  with their chair and tabl  shot down through the floor as if the earth had swallow them  they went rattl down a kind of roar chimney as rapid as a lift cut loos  and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom  but when gregori threw open a pair of door and let in a red subterranean light  syme was still smoke with one leg thrown over the other  and had not turn a yellow hair  gregori led him down a low  vault passag  at the end of which was the red light  it was an enorm crimson lantern  near as big as a fireplac  fix over a small but heavi iron door  in the door there was a sort of hatchway or grate  and on this gregori struck five time  a heavi voic with a foreign accent ask him who he was  to this he gave the more or less unexpect repli   mr  joseph chamberlain  the heavi hing began to move  it was obvious some kind of password  insid the doorway the passag gleam as if it were line with a network of steel  on a second glanc  syme saw that the glitter pattern was realli made up of rank and rank of rifl and revolv  close pack or interlock   i must ask you to forgiv me all these formal  said gregori   we have to be veri strict here   oh  don  t apologis  said syme   i know your passion for law and order  and he step into the passag line with the steel weapon  with his long  fair hair and rather foppish frock  coat  he look a singular frail and fanci figur as he walk down that shine avenu of death  they pass through sever such passag  and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curv wall  almost spheric in shape  but present  with it tier of bench  someth of the appear of a scientif lectur  theatr  there were no rifl or pistol in this apart  but round the wall of it were hung more dubious and dread shape  thing that look like the bulb of iron plant  or the egg of iron bird  they were bomb  and the veri room itself seem like the insid of a bomb  syme knock his cigar ash off against the wall  and went in   and now  my dear mr  syme  said gregori  throw himself in an expans manner on the bench under the largest bomb   now we are quit cosi  so let us talk proper  now no human word can give you ani notion of whi i brought you here  it was one of those quit arbitrari emot  like jump off a cliff or fall in love  suffic it to say that you were an inexpress irrit fellow  and  to do you justic  you are still  i would break twenti oath of secreci for the pleasur of take you down a peg  that way you have of light a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confess  well  you said that you were quit certain i was not a serious anarchist  doe this place strike you as be serious   it doe seem to have a moral under all it gaieti  assent syme   but may i ask you two question  you need not fear to give me inform  becaus  as you rememb  you veri wise extort from me a promis not to tell the polic  a promis i shall certain keep  so it is in mere curios that i make my queri  first of all  what is it realli all about  what is it you object to  you want to abolish govern   to abolish god  said gregori  open the eye of a fanat   we do not onli want to upset a few despot and polic regul  that sort of anarch doe exist  but it is a mere branch of the nonconformist  we dig deeper and we blow you higher  we wish to deni all those arbitrari distinct of vice and virtu  honour and treacheri  upon which mere rebel base themselv  the silli sentimentalist of the french revolut talk of the right of man  we hate right as we hate wrong  we have abolish right and wrong   and right and left  said syme with a simpl eager   i hope you will abolish them too  they are much more troublesom to me   you spoke of a second question  snap gregori   with pleasur  resum syme   in all your present act and surround there is a scientif attempt at secreci  i have an aunt who live over a shop  but this is the first time i have found peopl live from prefer under a public  hous  you have a heavi iron door  you cannot pass it without submit to the humili of call yourself mr  chamberlain  you surround yourself with steel instrument which make the place  if i may say so  more impress than homelik  may i ask whi  after take all this troubl to barricad yourselv in the bowel of the earth  you then parad your whole secret by talk about anarch to everi silli woman in saffron park  gregori smile   the answer is simpl  he said   i told you i was a serious anarchist  and you did not believ me  nor do they believ me  unless i took them into this infern room they would not believ me  syme smoke thought  and look at him with interest  gregori went on   the histori of the thing might amus you  he said   when first i becam one of the new anarchist i tri all kind of respect disguis  i dress up as a bishop  i read up all about bishop in our anarchist pamphlet  in superstit the vampir and priest of prey  i certain understood from them that bishop are strang and terribl old men keep a cruel secret from mankind  i was misinform  when on my first appear in episcop gaiter in a draw  room i cri out in a voic of thunder   down  down  presumptu human reason  they found out in some way that i was not a bishop at all  i was nab at onc  then i made up as a millionair  but i defend capit with so much intellig that a fool could see that i was quit poor  then i tri be a major  now i am a humanitarian myself  but i have  i hope  enough intellectu breadth to understand the posit of those who  like nietzsch  admir violenc  the proud  mad war of natur and all that  you know  i threw myself into the major  i drew my sword and wave it constant  i call out  blood  abstract  like a man call for wine  i often said   let the weak perish  it is the law  well  well  it seem major don  t do this  i was nab again  at last i went in despair to the presid of the central anarchist council  who is the greatest man in europ   what is his name  ask syme   you would not know it  answer gregori   that is his great  caesar and napoleon put all their genius into be heard of  and they were heard of  he put all his genius into not be heard of  and he is not heard of  but you cannot be for five minut in the room with him without feel that caesar and napoleon would have been children in his hand  he was silent and even pale for a moment  and then resum   but whenev he give advic it is alway someth as startl as an epigram  and yet as practic as the bank of england  i said to him   what disguis will hide me from the world  what can i find more respect than bishop and major  he look at me with his larg but indecipher face   you want a safe disguis  do you  you want a

said syme with sever benevol   i think you  d better  when gregori heard the danger dialogu end  with a sudden safeti for his rival  he rose abrupt and pace the floor in pain thought  he was  inde  in an agoni of diplomaci  it was clear that syme  s inspir impud was like to bring him out of all mere accident dilemma  littl was to be hope from them  he could not himself betray syme  part from honour  but part also becaus  if he betray him and for some reason fail to destroy him  the syme who escap would be a syme freed from all oblig of secreci  a syme who would simpli walk to the nearest polic station  after all  it was onli one night  s discuss  and onli one detect who would know of it  he would let out as littl as possibl of their plan that night  and then let syme go  and chanc it  he

it need not be long  this branch has alway had the honour of elect thursday for the central european council  we have elect mani and splendid thursday  we all lament the sad deceas of the heroic worker who occupi the post until last week  as you know  his servic to the caus were consider  he organis the great dynamit coup of brighton which  under happier circumst  ought to have kill everybodi on the pier  as you also know  his death was as self  deni as his life  for he die through his faith in a hygien mixtur of chalk and water as a substitut for milk  which beverag he regard as barbar  and as involv cruelti to the cow  cruelti  or anyth approach to cruelti  revolt him alway  but it is not to acclaim his virtu that we are met  but for a harder task  it is difficult proper to prais his qualiti  but it is more difficult to replac them  upon you  comrad  it devolv this even to choos out of the compani present the man who shall be thursday  if ani comrad suggest a name i will put it to the vote  if no comrad suggest a name  i can onli tell myself that that dear dynamit  who is gone from us  has carri into the unknow abyss the last secret of his virtu and his innoc  there was a stir of almost inaud applaus  such as is sometim heard in church  then a larg old man  with a long and vener white beard  perhap the onli real work  man present  rose lumber and said   i move that comrad gregori be elect thursday  and sat lumber down again   doe anyon second  ask the chairman  a littl man with a velvet coat and point beard second   befor i put the matter to the vote  said the chairman   i will call on comrad gregori to make a statement  gregori rose amid a great rumbl of applaus  his face was dead pale  so that by contrast his queer red hair look almost scarlet  but he was smile and altogeth at eas  he had made up his mind  and he saw his best polici quit plain in front of him like a white road  his best chanc was to make a soften and ambigu speech  such as would leav on the detect  s mind the impress that the anarchist brotherhood was a veri mild affair after all  he believ in his own literari power  his capac for suggest fine shade and pick perfect word  he thought that with care he could succeed  in spite of all the peopl around him  in convey an impress of the institut  subt and delic fals  syme had onc thought that anarchist  under all their bravado  were onli play the fool  could he not now  in the hour of peril  make syme think so again   comrad  began gregori  in a low but penetr voic   it is not necessari for me to tell you what is my polici  for it is your polici also  our belief has been slander  it has been disfigur  it has been utter confus and conceal  but it has never been alter  those who talk about anarch and it danger go everywher and anywher to get their inform  except to us  except to the fountain head  they learn about anarchist from sixpenni novel  they learn about anarchist from tradesmen  s newspap  they learn about anarchist from alli sloper  s half  holiday and the sport time  they never learn about anarchist from anarchist  we have no chanc of deni the mountain slander which are heap upon our head from one end of europ to anoth  the man who has alway heard that we are walk plagu has never heard our repli  i know that he will not hear it tonight  though my passion were to rend the roof  for it is deep  deep under the earth that the persecut are permit to assembl  as the christian assembl in the catacomb  but if  by some incred accid  there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immens misunderstood us  i would put this question to him   when those christian met in those catacomb  what sort of moral reput had they in the street abov  what tale were told of their atroc by one educ roman to anoth  suppos   i would say to him   suppos that we are onli repeat that still mysteri paradox of histori  suppos we seem as shock as the christian becaus we are realli as harmless as the

real silenc  then gregori fell back in his seat  a pale wreck of a man  and the chairman repeat  like a piec of clock  work sudden start again   the question is that comrad syme be elect to the post of thursday on the general council  the roar rose like the sea  the hand rose like a forest  and three minut afterward mr  gabriel syme  of the secret polic servic  was elect to the post of thursday on the general council of the anarchist of europ  everyon in the room seem to feel the tug wait on the river  the sword  stick and the revolv  wait on the tabl  the instant the elect was end and irrevoc  and syme had receiv the paper prove his elect  they all sprang to their feet  and the fieri group move and mix in the room  syme found himself  somehow or other  face to face with gregori  who still regard him with a stare of stun hatr  they were silent for mani minut   you are a devil  said gregori at last   and you are a gentleman  said syme with graviti   it was you that entrap me  began gregori  shake from head to foot   entrap me into   talk sens  said syme short   into what sort of devil  parliament have you entrap me  if it come to that  you made me swear befor i made you  perhap we are both do what we think right  but what we think right is so damn differ that there can be noth between us in the way of concess  there is noth possibl between us but honour and death  and he pull the great cloak about his shoulder and pick up the flask from the tabl   the boat is quit readi  said mr  button  bustl up   be good enough to step this way  with a gestur that reveal the shop  walker  he led syme down a short  iron  bound passag  the still agonis gregori follow feverish at their heel  at the end of the passag was a door  which button open sharpli  show a sudden blue and silver pictur of the moonlit river  that look like a scene in a theatr  close to the open lay a dark  dwarfish steam  launch  like a babi dragon with one red eye  almost in the act of step on board  gabriel syme turn to the gape gregori   you have kept your word  he said gentl  with his face in shadow   you are a man of honour  and i thank you  you have kept it even down to a small particular  there was one special thing you promis me at the begin of the affair  and which you have certain given me by the end of it   what do you mean  cri the chaotic gregori   what did i promis you   a veri entertain even  said syme  and he made a militari salut with the sword  stick as the steamboat slid away  chapter iv the tale of a detect gabriel syme was not mere a detect who pretend to be a poet  he was realli a poet who had becom a detect  nor was his hatr of anarchi hypocrit  he was one of those who are driven earli in life into too conserv an attitud by the bewild folli of most revolutionist  he had not attain it by ani tame tradit  his respect was spontan and sudden  a rebellion against rebellion  he came of a famili of crank  in which all the oldest peopl had all the newest notion  one of his uncl alway walk about without a hat  and anoth had made an unsuccess attempt to walk about with a hat and noth els  his father cultiv art and self  realis  his mother went in for simplic and hygien  henc the child  dure his tender year  was wholli unacquaint with ani drink between the extrem of absinth and cocoa  of both of which he had a healthi dislik  the more his mother preach a more than puritan abstin the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitud  and by the time the former had come to enforc vegetarian  the latter had pretti well reach the point of defend cannib  be surround with everi conceiv kind of revolt from infanc  gabriel had to revolt into someth  so he revolt into the onli thing left  saniti  but there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanat to make even his protest for common sens a littl too fierc to be sensibl  his hatr of modern lawless had been crown also by an accid  it happen that he was walk in a side street at the instant of a dynamit outrag  he had been blind and deaf for a moment  and then seen  the smoke clear  the broken window and the bleed face  after that he went about as usual  quiet  courteous  rather gentl  but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane  he did not regard anarchist  as most of us do  as a hand of morbid men  combin ignor with intellectu  he regard them as a huge and pitiless peril  like a chines invas  he pour perpetu into newspap and their wast  paper basket a torrent of tale  vers and violent articl  warn men of this delug of barbar denial  but he seem to be get no nearer his enemi  and  what was wors  no nearer a live  as he pace the thame embank  bitter bite a cheap cigar and brood on the advanc of anarchi  there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savag or so solitari as he  inde  he alway felt that govern stood alon and desper  with it back to the wall  he was too quixot to have care for it otherwis  he walk on the embank onc under a dark red sunset  the red river reflect the red sky  and they both reflect his anger  the sky  inde  was so swarthi  and the light on the river relat so lurid  that the water almost seem of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirror  it look like a stream of liter fire wind under the vast cavern of a subterranean countri  syme was shabbi in those day  he wore an old  fashion black chimney  pot hat  he was wrap in a yet more old  fashion cloak  black and rag  and the combin gave him the look of the earli villain in dicken and bulwer lytton  also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonin than when they appear long afterward  cut and point  on the lawn of saffron park  a long  lean  black cigar  bought in soho for twopenc  stood out from between his tighten teeth  and altogeth he look a veri satisfactori specimen of the anarchist upon whom he had vow a holi war  perhap this was whi a policeman on the embank spoke to him  and said  good even  syme  at a crisi of his morbid fear for human  seem stung by the mere stolid of the automat offici  a mere bulk of blue in the twilight   a good even is it  he said sharpli   you fellow would call the end of the world a good even  look at that bloodi red sun and that bloodi river  i tell you that if that were liter human blood  spilt and shine  you would still be stand here as solid as ever  look out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on  you policemen are cruel to the poor  but i could forgiv you even your cruelti if it were not for your calm   if we are calm  repli the policeman   it is the calm of organis resist   eh  said syme  stare   the soldier must be calm in the thick of the battl  pursu the policeman   the composur of an armi is the anger of a nation   good god  the board school  said syme   is this undenomin educ   no  said the policeman sad   i never had ani of those advantag  the board school came after my time  what educ i had was veri rough and old  fashion  i am afraid   where did you have it  ask syme  wonder   oh  at harrow  said the policeman the class sympathi which  fals as they are  are the truest thing in so mani men  broke out of syme befor he could control them   but  good lord  man  he said   you oughtn  t to be a policeman  the policeman sigh and shook his head   i know  he said solemn   i know i am not worthi   but whi did you join the polic  ask syme with rude curios   for much the same reason that you abus the polic  repli the other   i found that there was a special open in the servic for those whose fear for human were concern rather with the aberr of the scientif intellect than with the normal and excus  though excess  outbreak of the human will  i trust i make myself clear   if you mean that you make your opinion clear  said syme   i suppos you do  but as for make yourself clear  it is the last thing you do  how come a man like you to be talk philosophi in a blue helmet on the thame embank   you have evid not heard of the latest develop in our polic system  repli the other   i am not surpris at it  we are keep it rather dark from the educ class  becaus that class contain most of our enemi  but you seem to be exact in the right frame of mind  i think you might almost join us   join you in what  ask syme   i will tell you  said the policeman slowli   this is the situat  the head of one of our depart  one of the most celebr detect in europ  has long been of opinion that a pure intellectu conspiraci would soon threaten the veri exist of civilis  he is certain that the scientif and artist world are silent bound in a crusad against the famili and the state  he has  therefor  form a special corp of policemen  policemen who are also philosoph  it is their busi to watch the begin of this conspiraci  not mere in a crimin but in a controversi sens  i am a democrat myself  and i am fulli awar of the valu of the ordinari man in matter of ordinari valour or virtu  but it would obvious be undesir to employ the common policeman in an investig which is also a heresi hunt  syme  s eye were bright with a sympathet curios   what do you do  then  he said   the work of the philosoph policeman  repli the man in blue   is at onc bolder and more subtl than that of the ordinari detect  the ordinari detect goe to pot  hous to arrest thiev  we go to artist tea  parti to detect pessimist  the ordinari detect discov from a ledger or a diari that a crime has been commit  we discov from a book of sonnet that a crime will be commit  we have to trace the origin of those dread thought that drive men on at last to intellectu fanatic and intellectu crime  we were onli just in time to prevent the assassin at hartl pool  and that was entir due to the fact that our mr  wilk  a smart young fellow  thorough understood a triolet   do you mean  ask syme   that there is realli as much connect between crime and the modern intellect as all that   you are not suffici democrat  answer the policeman   but you were right when you said just now that our ordinari treatment of the poor crimin was a pretti brutal busi  i tell you i am sometim sick of my trade when i see how perpetu it mean mere a war upon the ignor and the desper  but this new movement of our is a veri differ affair  we deni the snobbish english assumpt that the uneduc are the danger crimin  we rememb the roman emperor  we rememb the great poison princ of the renaiss  we say that the danger crimin is the educ crimin  we say that the most danger crimin now is the entir lawless modern philosoph  compar to him  burglar and bigamist are essenti moral men  my heart goe out to them  they accept the essenti ideal of man  they mere seek it wrong  thiev respect properti  they mere wish the properti to becom their properti that they may more perfect respect it  but philosoph dislik properti as properti  they wish to destroy the veri idea of person possess  bigamist respect marriag  or they would not go through the high ceremoni and even ritualist formal of bigami  but philosoph despis marriag as marriag  murder respect human life  they mere wish to attain a greater ful of human life in themselv by the sacrific of what seem to them to be lesser live  but philosoph hate life itself  their own as much as other peopl  s  syme struck his hand togeth   how true that is  he cri   i have felt it from my boyhood  but never could state the verbal antithesi  the common crimin is a bad man  but at least he is  as it were  a condit good man  he say that if onli a certain obstacl be remov  say a wealthi uncl  he is then prepar to accept the univers and to prais god  he is a reform  but not an anarchist  he wish to cleans the edific  but not to destroy it  but the evil philosoph is not tri to alter thing  but to annihil them  yes  the modern world has retain all those part of polic work which are realli oppress and ignomini  the harri of the poor  the spi upon the unfortun  it has given up it more dignifi work  the punish of power traitor the in the state and power heresiarch in the church  the modern say we must not punish heret  my onli doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybodi els   but this is absurd  cri the policeman  clasp his hand with an excit uncommon in person of his figur and costum   but it is intoler  i don  t know what you  re do  but you  re wast your life  you must  you shall  join our special armi against anarchi  their armi are on our frontier  their bolt is readi to fall  a moment more  and you may lose the glori of work with us  perhap the glori of die with the last hero of the world   it is a chanc not to be miss  certain  assent syme   but still i do not quit understand  i know as well as anybodi that the modern world is full of lawless littl men and mad littl movement  but  beast as they are  they general have the one merit of disagre with each other  how can you talk of their lead one armi or hurl one bolt  what is this anarchi   do not confus it  repli the constabl   with those chanc dynamit outbreak from russia or from ireland  which are realli the outbreak of oppress  if mistaken  men  this is a vast philosoph movement  consist of an outer and an inner ring  you might even call the outer ring the laiti and the inner ring the priesthood  i prefer to call the outer ring the innoc section  the inner ring the suprem guilti section  the outer ring  the main mass of their support  are mere anarchist  that is  men who believ that rule and formula have destroy human happi  they believ that all the evil result of human crime are the result of the system that has call it crime  they do not believ that the crime creat the punish  they believ that the punish has creat the crime  they believ that if a man seduc seven women he would natur walk away as blameless as the flower of spring  they believ that if a man pick a pocket he would natur feel exquisit good  these i call the innoc section   oh  said syme   natur  therefor  these peopl talk about  a happi time come   the paradis of the futur   mankind freed from the bondag of vice and the bondag of virtu  and so on  and so also the men of the inner circl speak  the sacr priesthood  they also speak to applaud crowd of the happi of the futur  and of mankind freed at last  but in their mouth  and the policeman lower his voic  in their mouth these happi phrase have a horribl mean  they are under no illus  they are too intellectu to think that man upon this earth can ever be quit free of origin sin and the struggl  and they mean death  when they say that mankind shall be free at last  they mean that mankind shall commit suicid  when they talk of a paradis without right or wrong  they mean the grave  they have but two object  to destroy first human and then themselv  that is whi they throw bomb instead of fire pistol  the innoc rank and file are disappoint becaus the bomb has not kill the king  but the high  priesthood are happi becaus it has kill somebodi   how can i join you  ask syme  with a sort of passion   i know for a fact that there is a vacanc at the moment  said the policeman   as i have the honour to be somewhat in the confid of the chief of whom i have spoken  you should realli come and see him  or rather  i should not say see him  nobodi ever see him  but you can talk to him if you like   telephon  inquir syme  with interest   no  said the policeman placid   he has a fanci for alway sit in a pitch  dark room  he say it make his thought brighter  do come along  somewhat daze and consider excit  syme allow himself to be led to a side  door in the long row of build of scotland yard  almost befor he knew what he was do  he had been pass through the hand of about four intermedi offici  and was sudden shown into a room  the abrupt black of which startl him like a blaze of light  it was not the ordinari dark  in which form can be faint trace  it was like go sudden stone  blind   are you the new recruit  ask a heavi voic  and in some strang way  though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom  syme knew two thing  first  that it came from a man of massiv statur  and second  that the man had his back to him   are you the new recruit  said the invis chief  who seem to have heard all about it   all right  you are engag  syme  quit swept off his feet  made a feebl fight against this irrevoc phrase   i realli have no experi  he began   no one has ani experi  said the other   of the battl of armageddon   but i am realli unfit   you are will  that is enough  said the unknown   well  realli  said syme   i don  t know ani profess of which mere willing is the final test   i do  said the other  martyr  i am condemn you to death  good day  thus it was that when gabriel syme came out again into the crimson light of even  in his shabbi black hat and shabbi  lawless cloak  he came out a member of the new detect corp for the frustrat of the great conspiraci  act under the advic of his friend the policeman  who was profession inclin to neat  he trim his hair and beard  bought a good hat  clad himself in an exquisit summer suit of light blue  grey  with a pale yellow flower in the button  hole  and  in short  becam that eleg and rather insupport person whom gregori had first encount in the littl garden of saffron park  befor he final left the polic premis his friend provid him with a small blue card  on which was written   the last crusad  and a number  the sign of his offici author  he put this care in his upper waistcoat pocket  lit a cigarett  and went forth to track and fight the enemi in all the draw  room of london  where his adventur ultim led him we have alreadi seen  at about half  past one on a februari night he found himself steam in a small tug up the silent thame  arm with swordstick and revolv  the duli elect thursday of the central council of anarchist  when syme step out on to the steam  tug he had a singular sensat of step out into someth entir new  not mere into the landscap of a new land  but even into the landscap of a new planet  this was main due to the insan yet solid decis of that even  though part also to an entir chang in the weather and the sky sinc he enter the littl tavern some two hour befor  everi trace of the passion plumag of the cloudi sunset had been swept away  and a nake moon stood in a nake sky  the moon was so strong and full that  by a paradox often to be notic  it seem like a weaker sun  it gave  not the sens of bright moonshin  but rather of a dead daylight  over the whole landscap lay a lumin and unnatur discolor  as of that disastr twilight which milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclips  so that syme fell easili into his first thought  that he was actual on some other and emptier planet  which circl round some sadder star  but the more he felt this glitter desol in the moonlit land  the more his own chivalr folli glow in the night like a great fire  even the common thing he carri with him  the food and the brandi and the load pistol  took on exact that concret and materi poetri which a child feel when he take a gun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed  the sword  stick and the brandi  flask  though in themselv onli the tool of morbid conspir  becam the express of his own more healthi romanc  the sword  stick becam almost the sword of chivalri  and the brandi the wine of the stirrup  cup  for even the most dehumanis modern fantasi depend on some older and simpler figur  the adventur may be mad  but the adventur must be sane  the dragon without st  georg would not even be grotesqu  so this inhuman landscap was onli imagin by the presenc of a man realli human  to syme  s exagg mind the bright  bleak hous and terrac by the thame look as empti as the mountain of the moon  but even the moon is onli poetic becaus there is a man in the moon  the tug was work by two men  and with much toil went compar slowli  the clear moon that had lit up chiswick had gone down by the time that they pass battersea  and when they came under the enorm bulk of westminst day had alreadi begun to break  it broke like the split of great bar of lead  show bar of silver  and these had brighten like white fire when the tug  chang it onward cours  turn inward to a larg land stage rather beyond chare cross  the great stone of the embank seem equal dark and gigant as syme look up at them  they were big and black against the huge white dawn  they made him feel that he was land on the coloss step of some egyptian palac  and  inde  the thing suit his mood  for he was  in his own mind  mount to attack the solid throne of horribl and heathen king  he leapt out of the boat on to one slimi step  and stood  a dark and slender figur  amid the enorm masonri  the two men in the tug put her off again and turn up stream  they had never spoken a word  chapter v the feast of fear at first the larg stone stair seem to syme as desert as a pyramid  but befor he reach the top he had realis that there was a man lean over the parapet of the embank and look out across the river  as a figur he was quit convent  clad in a silk hat and frock  coat of the more formal type of fashion  he had a red flower in his buttonhol  as syme drew nearer to him step by step  he did not even move a hair  and syme could come close enough to notic even in the dim  pale morn light that his face was long  pale and intellectu  and end in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the veri point of the chin  all els be clean  shaven  this scrap of hair almost seem a mere oversight  the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven  clear  cut  ascet  and in it way nobl  syme drew closer and closer  note all this  and still the figur did not stir  at first an instinct had told syme that this was the man whom he was meant to meet  then  see that the man made no sign  he had conclud that he was not  and now again he had come back to a certainti that the man had someth to do with his mad adventur  for the man remain more still than would have been natur if a stranger had come so close  he was as motionless as a wax  work  and got on the nerv somewhat in the same way  syme look again and again at the pale  dignifi and delic face  and the face still look blank across the river  then he took out of his pocket the note from button prove his elect  and put it befor that sad and beauti face  then the man smile  and his smile was a shock  for it was all on one side  go up in the right cheek and down in the left  there was noth  ration speak  to scare anyon about this  mani peopl have this nervous trick of a crook smile  and in mani it is even attract  but in all syme  s circumst  with the dark dawn and the dead errand and the loneli on the great drip stone  there was someth unnerv in it  there was the silent river and the silent man  a man of even classic face  and there was the last nightmar touch that his smile sudden went wrong  the spasm of smile was instantan  and the man  s face drop at onc into it harmoni melancholi  he spoke without further explan or inquiri  like a man speak to an old colleagu   if we walk up toward leicest squar  he said   we shall just be in time for breakfast  sunday alway insist on an earli breakfast  have you had ani sleep   no  said syme   nor have i  answer the man in an ordinari tone   i shall tri to get to bed after breakfast  he spoke with casual civil  but in an utter dead voic that contradict the fanatic of his face  it seem almost as if all friend word were to him lifeless conveni  and that his onli life was hate  after a paus the man spoke again   of cours  the secretari of the branch told you everyth that can be told  but the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the presid  for his notion grow like a tropic forest  so in case you don  t know  i  d better tell you that he is carri out his notion of conceal ourselv by not conceal ourselv to the most extraordinari length just now  origin  of cours  we met in a cell underground  just as your branch doe  then sunday made us take a privat room at an ordinari restaur  he said that if you didn  t seem to be hide nobodi hunt you out  well  he is the onli man on earth  i know  but sometim i realli think that his huge brain is go a littl mad in it old age  for now we flaunt ourselv befor the public  we have our breakfast on a balconi  on a balconi  if you pleas  overlook leicest squar   and what do the peopl say  ask syme   it  s quit simpl what they say  answer his guid   they say we are a lot of jolli gentlemen who pretend they are anarchist   it seem to me a veri clever idea  said syme   clever  god blast your impud  clever  cri out the other in a sudden  shrill voic which was as startl and discord as his crook smile   when you  ve seen sunday for a split second you  ll leav off call him clever  with this they emerg out of a narrow street  and saw the earli sunlight fill leicest squar  it will never be known  i suppos  whi this squar itself should look so alien and in some way so continent  it will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attract the foreign or the foreign who gave it the foreign look  but on this particular morn the effect seem singular bright and clear  between the open squar and the sunlit leav and the statu and the saracen outlin of the alhambra  it look the replica of some french or even spanish public place  and this effect increas in syme the sensat  which in mani shape he had had through the whole adventur  the eeri sensat of have stray into a new world  as a fact  he had bought bad cigar round leicest squar ever sinc he was a boy  but as he turn that corner  and saw the tree and the moorish cupola  he could have sworn that he was turn into an unknown place de someth or other in some foreign town  at one corner of the squar there project a kind of angl of a prosper but quiet hotel  the bulk of which belong to a street behind  in the wall there was one larg french window  probabl the window of a larg coffe  room  and outsid this window  almost liter overhang the squar  was a formid buttress balconi  big enough to contain a dine  tabl  in fact  it did contain a dine  tabl  or more strict a breakfast  tabl  and round the breakfast  tabl  glow in the sunlight and evid to the street  were a group of noisi and talkat men  all dress in the insol of fashion  with white waistcoat and expens button  hole  some of their joke could almost be heard across the squar  then the grave secretari gave his unnatur smile  and syme knew that this boister breakfast parti was the secret conclav of the european dynamit  then  as syme continu to stare at them  he saw someth that he had not seen befor  he had not seen it liter becaus it was too larg to see  at the nearest end of the balconi  block up a great part of the perspect  was the back of a great mountain of a man  when syme had seen him  his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balconi of stone  his vast did not lie onli in the fact that he was abnorm tall and quit incred fat  this man was plan enorm in his origin proport  like a statu carv deliber as coloss  his head  crown with white hair  as seen from behind look bigger than a head ought to be  the ear that stood out from it look larger than human ear  he was enlarg terribl to scale  and this sens of size was so stagger  that when syme saw him all the other figur seem quit sudden to dwindl and becom dwarfish  they were still sit there as befor with their flower and frock  coat  but now it look as if the big man was entertain five children to tea  as syme and the guid approach the side door of the hotel  a waiter came out smile with everi tooth in his head   the gentlemen are up there  sare  he said   they do talk and they do laugh at what they talk  they do say they will throw bomb at ze king  and the waiter hurri away with a napkin over his arm  much pleas with the singular frivol of the gentlemen upstair  the two men mount the stair in silenc  syme had never thought of ask whether the monstrous man who almost fill and broke the balconi was the great presid of whom the other stood in awe  he knew it was so  with an unaccount but instantan certainti  syme  inde  was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psycholog influenc in a degre a littl danger to mental health  utter devoid of fear in physic danger  he was a great deal too sensit to the smell of spiritu evil  twice alreadi that night littl unmean thing had peep out at him almost prurient  and given him a sens of draw nearer and nearer to the head  quarter of hell  and this sens becam overpow as he drew nearer to the great presid  the form it took was a childish and yet hate fanci  as he walk across the inner room toward the balconi  the larg face of sunday grew larger and larger  and syme was grip with a fear that when he was quit close the face would be too big to be possibl  and that he would scream aloud  he rememb that as a child he would not look at the mask of memnon in the british museum  becaus it was a face  and so larg  by an effort  braver than that of leap over a cliff  he went to an empti seat at the breakfast  tabl and sat down  the men greet him with good  humour railleri as if they had alway known him  he sober himself a littl by look at their convent coat and solid  shine coffe  pot  then he look again at sunday  his face was veri larg  but it was still possibl to human  in the presenc of the presid the whole compani look suffici commonplac  noth about them caught the eye at first  except that by the presid  s capric they had been dress up with a festiv respect  which gave the meal the look of a wed breakfast  one man inde stood out at even a superfici glanc  he at least was the common or garden dynamit  he wore  inde  the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the occas  but out of this collar there sprang a head quit unmanag and quit unmistak  a bewild bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscur the eye like those of a skye terrier  but the eye did look out of the tangl  and they were the sad eye of some russian serf  the effect of this figur was not terribl like that of the presid  but it had everi diableri that can come from the utter grotesqu  if out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abrupt the head of a cat or a dog  it could not have been a more idiot contrast  the man  s name  it seem  was gogol  he was a pole  and in this circl of day he was call tuesday  his soul and speech were incur tragic  he could not forc himself to play the prosper and frivol part demand of him by presid sunday  and  inde  when syme came in the presid  with that dare disregard of public suspicion which was his polici  was actual chaf gogol upon his inabl to assum convent grace   our friend tuesday  said the presid in a deep voic at onc of quietud and volum   our friend tuesday doesn  t seem to grasp the idea  he dress up like a gentleman  but he seem to be too great a soul to behav like one  he insist on the way of the stage conspir  now if a gentleman goe about london in a top hat and a frock  coat  no one need know that he is an anarchist  but if a gentleman put on a top hat and a frock  coat  and then goe about on his hand and knee  well  he may attract attent  that  s what brother gogol doe  he goe about on his hand and knee with such inexhaust diplomaci  that by this time he find it quit difficult to walk upright   i am not good at gonceal  said gogol sulkili  with a thick foreign accent   i am not asham of the caus   yes you are  my boy  and so is the caus of you  said the presid good  natur   you hide as much as anybodi  but you can  t do it  you see  you  re such an ass  you tri to combin two inconsist method  when a household find a man under his bed  he will probabl paus to note the circumst  but if he find a man under his bed in a top hat  you will agre with me  my dear tuesday  that he is not like even to forget it  now when you were found under admir biffin  s bed   i am not good at decept  said tuesday gloomili  flush   right  my boy  right  said the presid with a ponder hearti   you aren  t good at anyth  while this stream of convers continu  syme was look more steadili at the men around him  as he did so  he gradual felt all his sens of someth spiritu queer return  he had thought at first that they were all of common statur and costum  with the evid except of the hairi gogol  but as he look at the other  he began to see in each of them exact what he had seen in the man by the river  a demoniac detail somewher  that lop  side laugh  which would sudden disfigur the fine face of his origin guid  was typic of all these type  each man had someth about him  perceiv perhap at the tenth or twentieth glanc  which was not normal  and which seem hard human  the onli metaphor he could think of was this  that they all look as men of fashion and presenc would look  with the addit twist given in a fals and curv mirror  onli the individu exampl will express this half  conceal eccentr  syme  s origin ciceron bore the titl of monday  he was the secretari of the council  and his twist smile was regard with more terror than anyth  except the presid  s horribl  happi laughter  but now that syme had more space and light to observ him  there were other touch  his fine face was so emaci  that syme thought it must be wast with some diseas  yet somehow the veri distress of his dark eye deni this  it was no physic ill that troubl him  his eye were aliv with intellectu tortur  as if pure thought was pain  he was typic of each of the tribe  each man was subt and differ wrong  next to him sat tuesday  the tousl  head gogol  a man more obvious mad  next was wednesday  a certain marqui de st  eustach  a suffici characterist figur  the first few glanc found noth unusu about him  except that he was the onli man at tabl who wore the fashion cloth as if they were realli his own  he had a black french beard cut squar and a black english frock  coat cut even squarer  but syme  sensit to such thing  felt somehow that the man carri a rich atmospher with him  a rich atmospher that suffoc  it remind one irrate of drowsi odour and of die lamp in the darker poem of byron and poe  with this went a sens of his be clad  not in lighter colour  but in softer materi  his black seem richer and warmer than the black shade about him  as if it were compound of profound colour  his black coat look as if it were onli black by be too dens a purpl  his black beard look as if it were onli black by be too deep a blue  and in the gloom and thick of the beard his dark red mouth show sensual and scorn  whatev he was he was not a frenchman  he might be a jew  he might be someth deeper yet in the dark heart of the east  in the bright colour persian tile and pictur show tyrant hunt  you may see just those almond eye  those blue  black beard  those cruel  crimson lip  then came syme  and next a veri old man  professor de worm  who still kept the chair of friday  though everi day it was expect that his death would leav it empti  save for his intellect  he was in the last dissolut of senil decay  his face was as grey as his long grey beard  his forehead was lift and fix final in a furrow of mild despair  in no other case  not even that of gogol  did the bridegroom brillianc of the morn dress express a more pain contrast  for the red flower in his button  hole show up against a face that was liter discolour like lead  the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandi had put their cloth upon a corps  when he rose or sat down  which was with long labour and peril  someth wors was express than mere weak  someth indefin connect with the horror of the whole scene  it did not express decrepitud mere  but corrupt  anoth hate fanci cross syme  s quiver mind  he could not help think that whenev the man move a leg or arm might fall off  right at the end sat the man call saturday  the simplest and the most baffl of all  he was a short  squar man with a dark  squar face clean  shaven  a medic practition go by the name of bull  he had that combin of savoir  fair with a sort of well  groom coars which is not uncommon in young doctor  he carri his fine cloth with confid rather than eas  and he most wore a set smile  there was noth whatev odd about him  except that he wore a pair of dark  almost opaqu spectacl  it may have been mere a crescendo of nervous fanci that had gone befor  but those black disc were dread to syme  they remind him of half  rememb ugli tale  of some stori about penni be put on the eye of the dead  syme  s eye alway caught the black glass and the blind grin  had the die professor worn them  or even the pale secretari  they would have been appropri  but on the younger and grosser man they seem onli an enigma  they took away the key of the face  you could not tell what his smile or his graviti meant  part from this  and part becaus he had a vulgar viril want in most of the other it seem to syme that he might be the wickedest of all those wick men  syme even had the thought that his eye might be cover up becaus they were too fright to see  chapter vi the exposur such were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world  again and again syme strove to pull togeth his common sens in their presenc  sometim he saw for an instant that these notion were subject  that he was onli look at ordinari men  one of whom was old  anoth nervous  anoth short  sight  the sens of an unnatur symbol alway settl back on him again  each figur seem to be  somehow  on the borderland of thing  just as their theori was on the borderland of thought  he knew that each one of these men stood at the extrem end  so to speak  of some wild road of reason  he could onli fanci  as in some old  world fabl  that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find someth  say a tree  that was more or less than a tree  a tree possess by a spirit  and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find someth els that was not wholli itself  a tower  perhap  of which the veri shape was wick  so these figur seem to stand up  violent and unaccount  against an ultim horizon  vision from the verg  the end of the earth were close in  talk had been go on steadili as he took in the scene  and not the least of the contrast of that bewild breakfast  tabl was the contrast between the easi and unobtrus tone of talk and it terribl purport  they were deep in the discuss of an actual and immedi plot  the waiter downstair had spoken quit correct when he said that they were talk about bomb and king  onli three day afterward the czar was to meet the presid of the french republ in pari  and over their bacon and egg upon their sunni balconi these beam gentlemen had decid how both should die  even the instrument was chosen  the black  beard marqui  it appear  was to carri the bomb  ordinarili speak  the proxim of this posit and object crime would have sober syme  and cure him of all his mere mystic tremor  he would have thought of noth but the need of save at least two human bodi from be rip in piec with iron and roar gas  but the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear  more pierc and practic than either his moral revuls or his social respons  veri simpli  he had no fear to spare for the french presid or the czar  he had begun to fear for himself  most of the talker took littl heed of him  debat now with their face closer togeth  and almost uniform grave  save when for an instant the smile of the secretari ran aslant across his face as the jag lightn run aslant across the sky  but there was one persist thing which first troubl syme and at last terrifi him  the presid was alway look at him  steadili  and with a great and baffl interest  the enorm man was quit quiet  but his blue eye stood out of his head  and they were alway fix on syme  syme felt move to spring up and leap over the balconi  when the presid  s eye were on him he felt as if he were made of glass  he had hard the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinari way sunday had found out that he was a spi  he look over the edg of the balconi  and saw a policeman  stand abstract just beneath  stare at the bright rail and the sunlit tree  then there fell upon him the great temptat that was to torment him for mani day  in the presenc of these power and repuls men  who were the princ of anarchi  he had almost forgotten the frail and fanci figur of the poet gregori  the mere aesthet of anarch  he even thought of him now with an old kind  as if they had play togeth when children  but he rememb that he was still tie to gregori by a great promis  he had promis never to do the veri thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of do  he had promis not to jump over that balconi and speak to that policeman  he took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrad  his soul sway in a vertigo of moral indecis  he had onli to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villain societi  and all his life could be as open and sunni as the squar beneath him  he had  on the other hand  onli to keep his antiqu honour  and be deliv inch by inch into the power of this great enemi of mankind  whose veri intellect was a tortur  chamber  whenev he look down into the squar he saw the comfort policeman  a pillar of common sens and common order  whenev he look back at the breakfast  tabl he saw the presid still quiet studi him with big  unbear eye  in all the torrent of his thought there were two thought that never cross his mind  first  it never occur to him to doubt that the presid and his council could crush him if he continu to stand alon  the place might be public  the project might seem imposs  but sunday was not the man who would carri himself thus easili without have  somehow or somewher  set open his iron trap  either by anonym poison or sudden street accid  by hypnot or by fire from hell  sunday could certain strike him  if he defi the man he was probabl dead  either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterward as by an innoc ailment  if he call in the polic prompt  arrest everyon  told all  and set against them the whole energi of england  he would probabl escap  certain not otherwis  they were a balcony of gentlemen overlook a bright and busi squar  but he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boat of arm pirat overlook an empti sea  there was a second thought that never came to him  it never occur to him to be spiritu won over to the enemi  mani modern  inur to a weak worship of intellect and forc  might have waver in their allegi under this oppress of a great person  they might have call sunday the super  man  if ani such creatur be conceiv  he look  inde  somewhat like it  with his earth  shake abstract  as of a stone statu walk  he might have been call someth abov man  with his larg plan  which were too obvious to be detect  with his larg face  which was too frank to be understood  but this was a kind of modern mean to which syme could not sink even in his extrem morbid  like ani man  he was coward enough to fear great forc  but he was not quit coward enough to admir it  the men were eat as they talk  and even in this they were typic  dr  bull and the marqui ate casual and convent of the best thing on the tabl  cold pheasant or strasbourg pie  but the secretari was a vegetarian  and he spoke earnest of the project murder over half a raw tomato and three quarter of a glass of tepid water  the old professor had such slop as suggest a sicken second childhood  and even in this presid sunday preserv his curious predomin of mere mass  for he ate like twenti men  he ate incred  with a fright fresh of appetit  so that it was like watch a sausag factori  yet continu  when he had swallow a dozen crumpet or drunk a quart of coffe  he would be found with his great head on one side stare at syme   i have often wonder  said the marqui  take a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam   whether it wouldn  t be better for me to do it with a knife  most of the best thing have been brought off with a knife  and it would be a new emot to get a knife into a french presid and wriggl it round   you are wrong  said the secretari  draw his black brow togeth   the knife was mere the express of the old person quarrel with a person tyrant  dynamit is not onli our best tool  but our best symbol  it is as perfect a symbol of us as is incens of the prayer of the christian  it expand  it onli destroy becaus it broaden  even so  thought onli destroy becaus it broaden  a man  s brain is a bomb  he cri out  loosen sudden his strang passion and strike his own skull with violenc   my brain feel like a bomb  night and day  it must expand  it must expand  a man  s brain must expand  if it break up the univers   i don  t want the univers broken up just yet  drawl the marqui   i want to do a lot of beast thing befor i die  i thought of one yesterday in bed   no  if the onli end of the thing is noth  said dr  bull with his sphinx  like smile   it hard seem worth do  the old professor was stare at the ceil with dull eye   everi man know in his heart  he said   that noth is worth do  there was a singular silenc  and then the secretari said   we are wander  howev  from the point  the onli question is how wednesday is to strike the blow  i take it we should all agre with the origin notion of a bomb  as to the actual arrang  i should suggest that tomorrow morn he should go first of all to  the speech was broken off short under a vast shadow  presid sunday had risen to his feet  seem to fill the sky abov them   befor we discuss that  he said in a small  quiet voic   let us go into a privat room  i have someth vent particular to say  syme stood up befor ani of the other  the instant of choic had come at last  the pistol was at his head  on the pavement befor he could hear the policeman idl stir and stamp  for the morn  though bright  was cold  a barrel  organ in the street sudden sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune  syme stood up taut  as if it had been a bugl befor the battl  he found himself fill with a supernatur courag that came from nowher  that jingl music seem full of the vivac  the vulgar  and the irrat valour of the poor  who in all those unclean street were all cling to the decenc and the chariti of christendom  his youth prank of be a policeman had fade from his mind  he did not think of himself as the repres of the corp of gentlemen turn into fanci constabl  or of the old eccentr who live in the dark room  but he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kind peopl in the street  who everi day march into battl to the music of the barrel  organ  and this high pride in be human had lift him unaccount to an infinit height abov the monstrous men around him  for an instant  at least  he look down upon all their sprawl eccentr from the starri pinnacl of the commonplac  he felt toward them all that unconsci and elementari superior that a brave man feel over power beast or a wise man over power error  he knew that he had neither the intellectu nor the physic strength of presid sunday  but in that moment he mind it no more than the fact that he had not the muscl of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinocero  all was swallow up in an ultim certainti that the presid was wrong and that the barrel  organ was right  there clang in his mind that unanswer and terribl truism in the song of roland   pagen ont tort et chretien ont droit  which in the old nasal french has the clang and groan of great iron  this liber of his spirit from the load of his weak went with a quit clear decis to embrac death  if the peopl of the barrel  organ could keep their old  world oblig  so could he  this veri pride in keep his word was that he was keep it to miscreant  it was his last triumph over these lunat to go down into their dark room and die for someth that they could not even understand  the barrel  organ seem to give the march tune with the energi and the mingl nois of a whole orchestra  and he could hear deep and roll  under all the trumpet of the pride of life  the drum of the pride of death  the conspir were alreadi file through the open window and into the room behind  syme went last  outward calm  but with all his brain and bodi throb with romant rhythm  the presid led them down an irregular side stair  such as might be use by servant  and into a dim  cold  empti room  with a tabl and bench  like an abandon boardroom  when they were all in  he close and lock the door  the first to speak was gogol  the irreconcil  who seem burst with inarticul grievanc   zso  zso  he cri  with an obscur excit  his heavi polish accent becom almost impenetr   you zay you nod  ide  you zay you show himselv  it is all nuzzink  ven you vant talk import you run yourselv in a dark box  the presid seem to take the foreign  s incoher satir with entir good humour   you can  t get hold of it yet  gogol  he said in a father way   when onc they have heard us talk nonsens on that balconi they will not care where we go afterward  if we had come here first  we should have had the whole staff at the keyhol  you don  t seem to know anyth about mankind   i die for zem  cri the pole in thick excit   and i slay zare oppressor  i care not for these game of gonzeal  i would zmite ze tyrant in ze open squar   i see  i see  said the presid  nod kind as he seat himself at the top of a long tabl   you die for mankind first  and then you get up and smite their oppressor  so that  s all right  and now may i ask you to control your beauti sentiment  and sit down with the other gentlemen at this tabl  for the first time this morn someth intellig is go to be said  syme  with the perturb promptitud he had shown sinc the origin summon  sat down first  gogol sat down last  grumbl in his brown beard about gombromis  no one except syme seem to have ani notion of the blow that was about to fall  as for him  he had mere the feel of a man mount the scaffold with the intent  at ani rate  of make a good speech   comrad  said the presid  sudden rise   we have spun out this farc long enough  i have call you down here to tell you someth so simpl and shock that even the waiter upstair  long inur to our leviti  might hear some

of some one reliabl member  i suggest comrad saturday  dr  bull  they all stare at him  then they all start in their seat  for the next word  though not loud  had a live and sensat emphasi  sunday struck the tabl   not one word more about the plan and place must be said at this meet  not one tini detail more about what we mean to do must be mention in this compani  sunday had spent his life in astonish his follow  but it seem as if he had never realli astonish them until now  they all move feverish in their seat  except syme  he sat stiff in his  with his hand in his pocket  and on the handl of his load revolv  when the attack on him came he would sell his life dear  he would find out at least if the presid was mortal  sunday went on smooth   you will probabl understand that there is onli one possibl motiv for forbid free speech at this festiv of freedom  stranger overhear us matter noth  they assum that we are joke  but what would matter  even unto death  is this  that there should be one actual among us who is not of us  who know our grave purpos  but doe not share it  who  the secretari scream out sudden like a woman   it can  t be  he cri  leap   there can  t  the presid flap his larg flat hand on the tabl like the fin of some huge fish   yes  he said slowli   there is a spi in this room  there is a traitor at this tabl  i will wast no more word  his name  syme half rose from his seat  his finger firm on the trigger   his name is gogol  said the presid   he is that hairi humbug over there who pretend to be a pole  gogol sprang to his feet  a pistol in each hand  with the same flash three men sprang at his throat  even the professor made an effort to rise  but syme saw littl of the scene  for he was blind with a benefic dark  he had sunk down into his seat shudder  in a palsi of passion relief  chapter vii the unaccount conduct of professor de worm  sit down  said sunday in a voic that he use onc or twice in his life  a voic that made men drop drawn sword  the three who had risen fell away from gogol  and that equivoc person himself resum his seat   well  my man  said the presid brisk  address him as one address a total stranger   will you oblig me by put your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and show me what you have there  the alleg pole was a littl pale under his tangl of dark hair  but he put two finger into the pocket with appar cool and pull out a blue strip of card  when syme saw it lie on the tabl  he woke up again to the world outsid him  for although the card lay at the other extrem of the tabl  and he could read noth of the inscript on it  it bore a startl resembl to the blue card in his own pocket  the card which had been given to him when he join the anti  anarchist constabulari   pathet slav  said the presid   tragic child of poland  are you prepar in the presenc of that card to deni that you are in this compani  shall we say de trop   right oh  said the late gogol  it made everyon jump to hear a clear  commerci and somewhat cockney voic come out of that forest of foreign hair  it was irrat  as if a chinaman had sudden spoken with a scotch accent   i gather that you fulli understand your posit  said sunday   you bet  answer the pole   i see it  s a fair cop  all i say is  i don  t believ ani pole could have imit my accent like i did his   i conced the point  said sunday   i believ your own accent to be inimit  though i shall practis it in my bath  do you mind leav your beard with your card   not a bit  answer gogol  and with one finger he rip off the whole of his shaggi head  cover  emerg with thin red hair and a pale  pert face   it was hot  he ad   i will do you the justic to say  said sunday  not without a sort of brutal admir   that you seem to have kept pretti cool under it  now listen to me  i like you  the consequ is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minut if i heard that you had die in torment  well  if you ever tell the polic or ani human soul about us  i shall have that two and a half minut of discomfort  on your discomfort i will not dwell  good day  mind the step  the red  hair detect who had masquerad as gogol rose to his feet without a word  and walk out of the room with an air of perfect nonchal  yet the astonish syme was abl to realis that this eas was sudden assum  for there was a slight stumbl outsid the door  which show that the depart detect had not mind the step   time is fli  said the presid in his gayest manner  after glanc at his watch  which like everyth about him seem bigger than it ought to be   i must go off at onc  i have to take the chair at a humanitarian meet  the secretari turn to him with work eyebrow   would it not be better  he said a littl sharpli   to discuss further the detail of our project  now that the spi has left us   no  i think not  said the presid with a yawn like an unobtrus earthquak   leav it as it is  let saturday settl it  i must be off  breakfast here next sunday  but the late loud scene had whip up the almost nake nerv of the secretari  he was one of those men who are conscienti even in crime   i must protest  presid  that the thing is irregular  he said   it is a fundament rule of our societi that all plan shall be debat in full council  of cours  i fulli appreci your forethought when in the actual presenc of a traitor   secretari  said the presid serious   if you  d take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be use  i can  t say  but it might  the secretari rear back in a kind of equin anger   i realli fail to understand  he began in high offens   that  s it  that  s it  said the presid  nod a great mani time   that  s where you fail right enough  you fail to understand  whi  you danc donkey  he roar  rise   you didn  t want to be overheard by a spi  didn  t you  how do you know you aren  t overheard now  and with these word he shoulder his way out of the room  shake with incomprehens scorn  four of the men left behind gape after him without ani appar glimmer of his mean  syme alon had even a glimmer  and such as it was it froze him to the bone  if the last word of the presid meant anyth  they meant that he had not after all pass unsuspect  they meant that while sunday could not denounc him like gogol  he still could not trust him like the other  the other four got to their feet grumbl more or less  and betook themselv elsewher to find lunch  for it was alreadi well past midday  the professor went last  veri slowli and pain  syme sat long after the rest had gone  revolv his strang posit  he had escap a thunderbolt  but he was still under a cloud  at last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into leicest squar  the bright  cold day had grown increas colder  and when he came out into the street he was surpris by a few flake of snow  while he still carri the sword  stick and the rest of gregori  s portabl luggag  he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewher  perhap on the steam  tug  perhap on the balconi  hope  therefor  that the snow  shower might be slight  he step back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasi hair  dresser  s shop  the front window of which was empti  except for a sick wax ladi in even dress  snow  howev  began to thicken and fall fast  and syme  have found one glanc at the wax ladi quit suffici to depress his spirit  stare out instead into the white and empti street  he was consider astonish to see  stand quit still outsid the shop and stare into the window  a man  his top hat was load with snow like the hat of father christma  the white drift was rise round his boot and ankl  but it seem as if noth could tear him away from the contempl of the colourless wax doll in dirti even dress  that ani human be should stand in such weather look into such a shop was a matter of suffici wonder to syme  but his idl wonder turn sudden into a person shock  for he realis that the man stand there was the paralyt old professor de worm  it scarc seem the place for a person of his year and infirm  syme was readi to believ anyth about the pervers of this dehuman brotherhood  but even he could not believ that the professor had fallen in love with that particular wax ladi  he could onli suppos that the man  s maladi  whatev it was  involv some momentari fit of rigid or tranc  he was not inclin  howev  to feel in this case ani veri compassion concern  on the contrari  he rather congratul himself that the professor  s stroke and his elabor and limp walk would make it easi to escap from him and leav him mile behind  for syme thirst first and last to get clear of the whole poison atmospher  if onli for an hour  then he could collect his thought  formul his polici  and decid final whether he should or should not keep faith with gregori  he stroll away through the danc snow  turn up two or three street  down through two or three other  and enter a small soho restaur for lunch  he partook reflect of four small and quaint cours  drank half a bottl of red wine  and end up over black coffe and a black cigar  still think  he had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaur  which was full of the chink of knive and the chatter of foreign  he rememb that in old day he had imagin that all these harmless and kind alien were anarchist  he shudder  rememb the real thing  but even the shudder had the delight shame of escap  the wine  the common food  the familiar place  the face of natur and talkat men  made him almost feel as if the council of the seven day had been a bad dream  and although he knew it was nevertheless an object realiti  it was at least a distant one  tall hous and popul street lay between him and his last sight of the shame seven  he was free in free london  and drink wine among the free  with a somewhat easier action  he took his hat and stick and stroll down the stair into the shop below  when he enter that lower room he stood stricken and root to the spot  at a small tabl  close up to the blank window and the white street of snow  sat the old anarchist professor over a glass of milk  with his lift livid face and pendent eyelid  for an instant syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon  then with a gestur as of blind hurri  he brush past the professor  dash open the door and slam it behind him  and stood outsid in the snow   can that old corps be follow me  he ask himself  bite his yellow moustach   i stop too long up in that room  so that even such leaden feet could catch me up  one comfort is  with a littl brisk walk i can put a man like that as far away as timbuctoo  or am i too fanci  was he realli follow me  sure sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man   he set off at a smart pace  twist and whirl his stick  in the direct of covent garden  as he cross the great market the snow increas  grow blind and bewild as the afternoon began to darken  the snow  flake torment him like a swarm of silver bee  get into his eye and beard  they ad their unremit futil to his alreadi irrit nerv  and by the time that he had come at a swing pace to the begin of fleet street  he lost patienc  and find a sunday teashop  turn into it to take shelter  he order anoth cup of black coffe as an excus  scarc had he done so  when professor de worm hobbl heavili into the shop  sat down with difficulti and order a glass of milk  syme  s walk  stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang  which confess the conceal steel  but the professor did not look round  syme  who was common a cool charact  was liter gape as a rustic gape at a conjur trick  he had seen no cab follow  he had heard no wheel outsid the shop  to all mortal appear the man had come on foot  but the old man could onli walk like a snail  and syme had walk like the wind  he start up and snatch his stick  half crazi with the contradict in mere arithmet  and swung out of the swing door  leav his coffe untast  an omnibus go to the bank went rattl by with an unusu rapid  he had a violent run of a hundr yard to reach it  but he manag to spring  sway upon the splash  board and  paus for an instant to pant  he climb on to the top  when he had been seat for about half a minut  he heard behind him a sort of heavi and asthmat breath  turn sharpli  he saw rise gradual higher and higher up the omnibus step a top hat soil and drip with snow  and under the shadow of it brim the short  sight face and shaki shoulder of professor de worm  he let himself into a seat with characterist care  and wrap himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug  everi movement of the old man  s totter figur and vagu hand  everi uncertain gestur and panic  stricken paus  seem to put it beyond question that he was helpless  that he was in the last imbecil of the bodi  he move by inch  he let himself down with littl gasp of caution  and yet  unless the philosoph entiti call time and space have no vestig even of a practic exist  it appear quit unquestion that he had run after the omnibus  syme sprang erect upon the rock car  and after stare wild at the wintri sky  that grew gloomier everi moment  he ran down the step  he had repress an element impuls to leap over the side  too bewild to look back or to reason  he rush into one of the littl court at the side of fleet street as a rabbit rush into a hole  he had a vagu idea  if this incomprehens old jack  in  the  box was realli pursu him  that in that labyrinth of littl street he could soon throw him off the scent  he dive in and out of those crook lane  which were more like crack than thoroughfar  and by the time that he had complet about twenti altern angl and describ an unthink polygon  he paus to listen for ani sound of pursuit  there was none  there could not in ani case have been much  for the littl street were thick with the soundless snow  somewher behind red lion court  howev  he notic a place where some energet citizen had clear away the snow for a space of about twenti yard  leav the wet  glisten cobbl  stone  he thought littl of this as he pass it  onli plung into yet anoth arm of the maze  but when a few hundr yard farther on he stood still again to listen  his heart stood still also  for he heard from that space of rug stone the clink crutch and labour feet of the infern crippl  the sky abov was load with the cloud of snow  leav london in a dark and oppress prematur for that hour of the even  on each side of syme the wall of the alley were blind and featureless  there was no littl window or ani kind of eve  he felt a new impuls to break out of this hive of hous  and to get onc more into the open and lamp  lit street  yet he rambl and dodg for a long time befor he struck the main thoroughfar  when he did so  he struck it much farther up than he had fanci  he came out into what seem the vast and void of ludgat circus  and saw st  paul  s cathedr sit in the sky  at first he was startl to find these great road so empti  as if a pestil had swept through the citi  then he told himself that some degre of empti was natur  first becaus the snow  storm was even danger deep  and second becaus it was sunday  and at the veri word sunday he bit his lip  the word was henceforth for hire like some indec pun  under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmospher of the citi was turn to a veri queer kind of green twilight  as of men under the sea  the seal and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of st  paul  s had in it smoki and sinist colour  colour of sick green  dead red or decay bronz  that were just bright enough to emphasis the solid white of the snow  but right up against these dreari colour rose the black bulk of the cathedr  and upon the top of the cathedr was a random splash and great stain of snow  still cling as to an alpin peak  it had fallen accident  but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from it veri topmost point  and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross  when syme saw it he sudden straighten himself  and made with his sword  stick an involuntari salut  he knew that that evil figur  his shadow  was creep quick or slowli behind him  and he did not care  it seem a symbol of human faith and valour that while the sky were darken that high place of the earth was bright  the devil might have captur heaven  but they had not yet captur the cross  he had a new impuls to tear out the secret of this danc  jump and pursu paralyt  and at the entranc of the court as it open upon the circus he turn  stick in hand  to face his pursuer  professor de worm came slowli round the corner of the irregular alley behind him  his unnatur form outlin against a lone gas  lamp  irresist recal that veri imagin figur in the nurseri rhyme   the crook man who went a crook mile  he realli look as if he had been twist out of shape by the tortuous street he had been thread  he came nearer and nearer  the lamplight shine on his lift spectacl  his lift  patient face  syme wait for him as st  georg wait for the dragon  as a man wait for a final explan or for death  and the old professor came right up to him and pass him like a total stranger  without even a blink of his mourn eyelid  there was someth in this silent and unexpect innoc that left syme in a final furi  the man  s colourless face and manner seem to assert that the whole follow had been an accid  syme was galvanis with an energi that was someth between bitter and a burst of boyish deris  he made a wild gestur as if to knock the old man  s hat off  call out someth like  catch me if you can  and went race away across the white  open circus  conceal was imposs now  and look back over his shoulder  he could see the black figur of the old gentleman come after him with long  swing stride like a man win a mile race  but the head upon that bound bodi was still pale  grave and profession  like the head of a lectur upon the bodi of a harlequin  this outrag chase sped across ludgat circus  up ludgat hill  round st  paul  s cathedr  along cheapsid  syme rememb all the nightmar he had ever known  then syme broke away toward the river  and end almost down by the dock  he saw the yellow pane of a low  light public  hous  flung himself into it and order beer  it was a foul tavern  sprinkl with foreign sailor  a place where opium might be smoke or knive drawn  a moment later professor de worm enter the place  sat down care  and ask for a glass of milk  chapter viii the professor explain when gabriel syme found himself final establish in a chair  and opposit to him  fix and final also  the lift eyebrow and leaden eyelid of the professor  his fear fulli return  this incomprehens man from the fierc council  after all  had certain pursu him  if the man had one charact as a paralyt and anoth charact as a pursuer  the antithesi might make him more interest  but scarc more sooth  it would be a veri small comfort that he could not find the professor out  if by some serious accid the professor should find him out  he empti a whole pewter pot of ale befor the professor had touch his milk  one possibl  howev  kept him hope and yet helpless  it was just possibl that this escapad signifi someth other than even a slight suspicion of him  perhap it was some regular form or sign  perhap the foolish scamper was some sort of friend signal that he ought to have understood  perhap it was a ritual  perhap the new thursday was alway chase along cheapsid  as the new lord mayor is alway escort along it  he was just select a tentat inquiri  when the old professor opposit sudden and simpli cut him short  befor syme could ask the first diplomat question  the old anarchist had ask sudden  without ani sort of prepar   are you a policeman  whatev els syme had expect  he had never expect anyth so brutal and actual as this  even his great presenc of mind could onli manag a repli with an air of rather blunder jocular   a policeman  he said  laugh vagu   whatev made you think of a policeman in connect with me   the process was simpl enough  answer the professor patient   i thought you look like a policeman  i think so now   did i take a policeman  s hat by mistak out of the restaur  ask syme  smile wild   have i by ani chanc got a number stuck on to me somewher  have my boot got that watch look  whi must i be a policeman  do  do let me be a postman  the old professor shook his head with a graviti that gave no hope  but syme ran on with a feverish ironi   but perhap i misunderstood the delicaci of your german philosophi  perhap policeman is a relat term  in an evolutionari sens  sir  the ape fade so gradual into the policeman

voic  but with an undercurr of inhuman exalt   who would condescend to strike down the mere thing that he doe not fear  who would debas himself to be mere brave  like ani common prizefight  who would stoop to be fearless  like a tree  fight the thing that you fear  you rememb the old tale of the english clergyman who gave the last rite to the brigand of sicili  and how on his death  bed the great

mean  he ask sharpli   will you join me  will you take the risk   young man  said the professor pleasant   i am amus to observ that you think i am a coward  as to that i will say onli one word  and that shall be entir in the manner of your own philosoph rhetor  you think that it is possibl to pull down the presid  i know that it is imposs  and i am go to tri it  and open the tavern door  which let in a blast of bitter air  they went out togeth into the dark street by the dock  most of the snow was melt or trampl to mud  but here and there a clot of it still show grey rather than white in the gloom  the small street were sloppi and full of pool  which reflect the flame lamp irregular  and by accid  like fragment of some other and fallen world  syme felt almost daze as he step through this grow confus of light and shadow  but his companion walk on with a certain brisk  toward where  at the end of the street  an inch or two of the lamplit river look like a bar of flame   where are you go  syme inquir   just now  answer the professor   i am go just round the corner to see whether dr  bull has gone to bed  he is hygien  and retir earli   dr  bull  exclaim syme   doe he live round the corner   no  answer his friend   as a matter of fact he live some way off  on the other side of the river  but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed  turn the corner as he spoke  and face the dim river  fleck with flame  he point with his stick to the other bank  on the surrey side at this point there ran out into the thame  seem almost to overhang it  a bulk and cluster of those tall tenement  dot with light window  and rise like factori chimney to an almost insan height  their special pois and posit made one block of build especi look like a tower of babel with a hundr eye  syme had never seen ani of the sky  scrape build in america  so he could onli think of the build in a dream  even as he stare  the highest light in this innumer light turret abrupt went out  as if this black argus had wink at him with one of his innumer eye  professor de worm swung round on his heel  and struck his stick against his boot   we are too late  he said   the hygien doctor has gone to bed   what do you mean  ask syme   doe he live over there  then   yes  said de worm   behind that particular window which you can  t see  come along and get some dinner  we must call on him tomorrow morn  without further parley  he led the way through sever by  way until they came out into the flare and clamour of the east india dock road  the professor  who seem to know his way about the neighbourhood  proceed to a place where the line of light shop fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet  in which an old white inn  all out of repair  stood back some twenti feet from the road   you can find good english inn left by accid everywher  like fossil  explain the professor   i onc found a decent place in the west end   i suppos  said syme  smile   that this is the correspond decent place in the east end   it is  said the professor rever  and went in  in that place they dine and slept  both veri thorough  the bean and bacon  which these unaccount peopl cook well  the astonish emerg of burgundi from their cellar  crown syme  s sens of a new comradeship and comfort  through all this ordeal his root horror had been isol  and there are no word to express the abyss between isol and have one alli  it may be conced to the mathematician that four is twice two  but two is not twice one  two is two thousand time one  that is whi  in spite of a hundr disadvantag  the world will alway return to monogami  syme was abl to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrag tale  from the time when gregori had taken him to the littl tavern by the river  he did it idl and ampli  in a luxuri monologu  as a man speak with veri old friend  on his side  also  the man who had imperson professor de worm was not less communic  his own stori was almost as silli as syme  s   that  s a good get  up of your  said syme  drain a glass of macon   a lot better than old gogol  s  even at the start i thought he was a bit too hairi   a differ of artist theori  repli the professor pensiv   gogol was an idealist  he made up as the abstract or platon ideal of an anarchist  but i am a realist  i am a portrait painter  but  inde  to say that i am a portrait painter is an inadequ express  i am a portrait   i don  t understand you  said syme   i am a portrait  repeat the professor   i am a portrait of the celebr professor de worm  who is  i believ  in napl   you mean you are made up like him  said syme   but doesn  t he know that you are take his nose in vain   he know it right enough  repli his friend cheer   then whi doesn  t he denounc you   i have denounc him  answer the professor   do explain yourself  said syme   with pleasur  if you don  t mind hear my stori  repli the emin foreign philosoph   i am by profess an actor  and my name is wilk  when i was on the stage i mix with all sort of bohemian and blackguard compani  sometim i touch the edg of the turf  sometim the riff  raff of the art  and occasion the polit refuge  in some den of exil dreamer i was introduc to the great german nihilist philosoph  professor de worm  i did not gather much about him beyond his appear  which was veri disgust  and which i studi care  i understood that he had prove that the destruct principl in the univers was god  henc he insist on the need for a furious and incess energi  rend all thing in piec  energi  he said  was the all  he was lame  shortsight  and partial paralyt  when i met him i was in a frivol mood  and i dislik him so much that i resolv to imit him  if i had been a draughtsman i would have drawn a caricatur  i was onli an actor  i could onli act a caricatur  i made myself up into what was meant for a wild exagger of the old professor  s dirti old self  when i went into the room full of his support i expect to be receiv with a roar of laughter  or  if they were too far gone  with a roar of indign at the insult  i cannot describ the surpris i felt when my entranc was receiv with a respect silenc  follow  when i had first open my lip  with a murmur of admir  the curs of the perfect artist had fallen upon me  i had been too subtl  i had been too true  they thought i realli was the great nihilist professor  i was a healthi  mind young man at the time  and i confess that it was a blow  befor i could fulli recov  howev  two or three of these admir ran up to me radiat indign  and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room  i inquir it natur  it seem that an impertin fellow had dress himself up as a preposter parodi of myself  i had drunk more champagn than was good for me  and in a flash of folli i decid to see the situat through  consequ it was to meet the glare of the compani and my own lift eyebrow and freez eye that the real professor came into the room   i need hard say there was a collis  the pessimist all round me look anxious from one professor to the other professor to see which was realli the more feebl  but i won  an old man in poor health  like my rival  could not be expect to be so impress feebl as a young actor in the prime of life  you see  he realli had paralysi  and work within this definit limit  he couldn  t be so jolli paralyt as i was  then he tri to blast my claim intellectu  i counter that by a veri simpl dodg  whenev he said someth that nobodi but he could understand  i repli with someth which i could not even understand myself   i don  t fanci  he said   that you could have work out the principl that evolut is onli negat  sinc there inher in it the introduct of lacuna  which are an essenti of differenti  i repli quit scorn   you read all that up in pinckwert  the notion that involut function eugen was expos long ago by glump  it is unnecessari for me to say that there never were such peopl as pinckwert and glump  but the peopl all round  rather to my surpris  seem to rememb them quit well  and the professor  find that the learn and mysteri method left him rather at the merci of an enemi slight defici in scrupl  fell back upon a more popular form of wit   i see  he sneer   you prevail like the fals pig in aesop   and you fail  i answer  smile   like the hedgehog in montaign  need i say that there is no hedgehog in montaign   your claptrap come off  he said   so would your beard  i had no intellig answer to this  which was quit true and rather witti  but i laugh heartili  answer   like the pantheist  s boot  at random  and turn on my heel with all the honour of victori  the real professor was thrown out  but not with violenc  though one man tri veri patient to pull off his nose  he is now  i believ  receiv everywher in europ as a delight impostor  his appar earnest and anger  you see  make him all the more entertain   well  said syme   i can understand your put on his dirti old beard for a night  s practic joke  but i don  t understand your never take it off again   that is the rest of the stori  said the imperson   when i myself left the compani  follow by rever applaus  i went limp down the dark street  hope that i should soon be far enough away to be abl to walk like a human be  to my astonish  as i was turn the corner  i felt a touch on the shoulder  and turn  found myself under the shadow of an enorm policeman  he told me i was want  i struck a sort of paralyt attitud  and cri in a high german accent   yes  i am want  by the oppress of the world  you are arrest me on the charg of be the great anarchist  professor de worm  the policeman impass consult a paper in his hand   no  sir  he said civilli   at least  not exact  sir  i am arrest you on the charg of not be the celebr anarchist  professor de worm  this charg  if it was crimin at all  was certain the lighter of the two  and i went along with the man  doubt  but not great dismay  i was shown into a number of room  and eventu into the presenc of a polic offic  who explain that a serious campaign had been open against the centr of anarchi  and that this  my success masquerad  might be of consider valu to the public safeti  he offer me a good salari and this littl blue card  though our convers was short  he struck me as a man of veri massiv common sens and humour  but i cannot tell you much about him person  becaus  syme laid down his knife and fork   i know  he said   becaus you talk to him in a dark room  professor de worm nod and drain his glass  chapter ix the man in spectacl  burgundi is a jolli thing  said the professor sad  as he set his glass down   you don  t look as if it were  said syme   you drink it as if it were medicin   you must excus my manner  said the professor dismal   my posit is rather a curious one  insid i am realli burst with boyish merriment  but i act the paralyt professor so well  that now i can  t leav off  so that when i am among friend  and have no need at all to disguis myself  i still can  t help speak slow and wrinkl my forehead  just as if it were my forehead  i can be quit happi  you understand  but onli in a paralyt sort of way  the most buoyant exclam leap up in my heart  but they come out of my mouth quit differ  you should hear me say   buck up  old cock  it would bring tear to your eye   it doe  said syme   but i cannot help think that apart from all that you are realli a bit worri  the professor start a littl and look at him steadili   you are a veri clever fellow  he said   it is a pleasur to work with you  yes  i have rather a heavi cloud in my head  there is a great problem to face  and he sank his bald brow in his two hand  then he said in a low voic   can you play the piano   yes  said syme in simpl wonder   i  m suppos to have a good touch  then  as the other did not speak  he ad   i trust the great cloud is lift  after a long silenc  the professor said out of the cavern shadow of his hand   it would have done just as well if you could work a typewrit   thank you  said syme   you flatter me   listen to me  said the other   and rememb whom we have to see tomorrow  you and i are go tomorrow to attempt someth which is veri much more danger than tri to steal the crown jewel out of the tower  we are tri to steal a secret from a veri sharp  veri strong  and veri wick man  i believ there is no man  except the presid  of cours  who is so serious startl and formid as that littl grin fellow in goggl  he has not perhap the white  hot enthusiasm unto death  the mad martyrdom for anarchi  which mark the secretari  but then that veri fanatic in the secretari has a human patho  and is almost a redeem trait  but the littl doctor has a brutal saniti that is more shock than the secretari  s diseas  don  t you notic his detest viril and vital  he bounc like an india  rubber ball  depend on it  sunday was not asleep  i wonder if he ever sleep  when he lock up all the plan of this outrag in the round  black head of dr  bull   and you think  said syme   that this uniqu monster will be sooth if i play the piano to him   don  t be an ass  said his mentor   i mention the piano becaus it give one quick and independ finger  syme  if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or aliv  we must have some code of signal between us that this brute will not see  i have made a rough alphabet cypher correspond to the five finger  like this  see  and he rippl with his finger on the wooden tabl  b a d  bad  a word we may frequent requir  syme pour himself out anoth glass of wine  and began to studi the scheme  he was abnorm quick with his brain at puzzl  and with his hand at conjur  and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simpl messag by what would seem to be idl tap upon a tabl or knee  but wine and companionship had alway the effect of inspir him to a farcic ingenu  and the professor soon found himself struggl with the too vast energi of the new languag  as it pass through the heat brain of syme   we must have sever word  sign  said syme serious  word that we are like to want  fine shade of mean  my favourit word is  coeval  what  s your   do stop play the goat  said the professor plaintiv   you don  t know how serious this is   lush  too  said syme  shake his head sagaci   we must have  lush  word appli to grass  don  t you know   do you imagin  ask the professor furious   that we are go to talk to dr  bull about grass   there are sever way in which the subject could be approach  said syme reflect   and the word introduc without appear forc  we might say   dr  bull  as a revolutionist  you rememb that a tyrant onc advis us to eat grass  and inde mani of us  look on the fresh lush grass of summer   do you understand  said the other   that this is a tragedi   perfect  repli syme   alway be comic in a tragedi  what the deuc els can you do  i wish this languag of your had a wider scope  i suppos we could not extend it from the finger to the toe  that would involv pull off our boot and sock dure the convers  which howev unobtrus perform   syme  said his friend with a stern simplic   go to bed  syme  howev  sat up in bed for a consider time master the new code  he was awaken next morn while the east was still seal with dark  and found his grey  beard alli stand like a ghost besid his bed  syme sat up in bed blink  then slowli collect his thought  threw off the bed  cloth  and stood up  it seem to him in some curious way that all the safeti and sociabl of the night befor fell with the bedcloth off him  and he stood up in an air of cold danger  he still felt an entir trust and loyalti toward his companion  but it was the trust between two men go to the scaffold   well  said syme with a forc cheer as he pull on his trouser   i dreamt of that alphabet of your  did it take you long to make it up  the professor made no answer  but gaze in front of him with eye the colour of a wintri sea  so syme repeat his question   i say  did it take you long to invent all this  i  m consid good at these thing  and it was a good hour  s grind  did you learn it all on the spot  the professor was silent  his eye were wide open  and he wore a fix but veri small smile   how long did it take you  the professor did not move   confound you  can  t you answer  call out syme  in a sudden anger that had someth like fear underneath  whether or no the professor could answer  he did not  syme stood stare back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank  blue eye  his first thought was that the professor had gone mad  but his second thought was more fright  after all  what did he know about this queer creatur whom he had heedless accept as a friend  what did he know  except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridicul tale  how improb it was that there should be anoth friend there besid gogol  was this man  s silenc a sensat way of declar war  was this adamantin stare after all onli the aw sneer of some threefold traitor  who had turn for the last time  he stood and strain his ear in this heartless silenc  he almost fanci he could hear dynamit come to captur him shift soft in the corridor outsid  then his eye stray downward  and he burst out laugh  though the professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statu  his five dumb finger were danc aliv upon the dead tabl  syme watch the twinkl movement of the talk hand  and read clear the messag   i will onli talk like this  we must get use to it  he rap out the answer with the impati of relief   all right  let  s get out to breakfast  they took their hat and stick in silenc  but as syme took his sword  stick  he held it hard  they paus for a few minut onli to stuff down coffe and coars thick sandwich at a coffe stall  and then made their way across the river  which under the grey and grow light look as desol as acheron  they reach the bottom of the huge block of build which they had seen from across the river  and began in silenc to mount the nake and numberless stone step  onli paus now and then to make short remark on the rail of the banist  at about everi other flight they pass a window  each window show them a pale and tragic dawn lift itself labori over london  from each the innumer roof of slate look like the leaden surg of a grey  troubl sea after rain  syme was increas conscious that his new adventur had somehow a qualiti of cold saniti wors than the wild adventur of the past  last night  for instanc  the tall tenement had seem to him like a tower in a dream  as he now went up the weari and perpetu step  he was daunt and bewild by their almost infinit seri  but it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anyth that might be exagger or delus  their infin was more like the empti infin of arithmet  someth unthink  yet necessari to thought  or it was like the stun statement of astronomi about the distanc of the fix star  he was ascend the hous of reason  a thing more hideous than unreason itself  by the time they reach dr  bull  s land  a last window show them a harsh  white dawn edg with bank of a kind of coars red  more like red clay than red cloud  and when they enter dr  bull  s bare garret it was full of light  syme had been haunt by a half histor memori in connect with these empti room and that auster daybreak  the moment he saw the garret and dr  bull sit write at a tabl  he rememb what the memori was  the french revolut  there should have been the black outlin of a guillotin against that heavi red and white of the morn  dr  bull was in his white shirt and black breech onli  his crop  dark head might well have just come out of it wig  he might have been marat or a more slipshod robespierr  yet when he was seen proper  the french fanci fell away  the jacobin were idealist  there was about this man a murder materi  his dosit gave him a somewhat new appear  the strong  white light of morn come from one side creat sharp shadow  made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had look at the breakfast on the balconi  thus the two black glass that encas his eye might realli have been black caviti in his skull  make him look like a death  s  head  and  inde  if ever death himself sat write at a wooden tabl  it might have been he  he look up and smile bright enough as the men came in  and rose with the resili rapid of which the professor had spoken  he set chair for both of them  and go to a peg behind the door  proceed to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough  dark tweed  he button it up neat  and came back to sit down at his tabl  the quiet good humour of his manner left his two oppon helpless  it was with some momentari difficulti that the professor broke silenc and began   i  m sorri to disturb you so earli  comrad  said he  with a care resumpt of the slow de worm manner   you have no doubt made all the arrang for the pari affair  then he ad with infinit slow   we have inform which render intoler anyth in the natur of a moment  s delay  dr  bull smile again  but continu to gaze on them without speak  the professor resum  a paus befor each weari word   pleas do not think me excess abrupt  but i advis you to alter those plan  or if it is too late for that  to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him  comrad syme and i have had an experi which it would take more time to recount than we can afford  if we are to act on it  i will  howev  relat the occurr in detail  even at the risk of lose time  if you realli feel that it is essenti to the understand of the problem we have to discuss  he was spin out his sentenc  make them intoler long and linger  in the hope of madden the practic littl doctor into an explos of impati which might show his hand  but the littl doctor continu onli to stare and smile  and the monologu was uphil work  syme began to feel a new sick and despair  the doctor  s smile and silenc were not at all like the catalept stare and horribl silenc which he had confront in the professor half an hour befor  about the professor  s makeup and all his antic there was alway someth mere grotesqu  like a gollywog  syme rememb those wild woe of yesterday as one rememb be afraid of bogi in childhood  but here was daylight  here was a healthi  squar  shoulder man in tweed  not odd save for the accid of his ugli spectacl  not glare or grin at all  but smile steadili and not say a word  the whole had a sens of unbear realiti  under the increas sunlight the colour of the doctor  s complexion  the pattern of his tweed  grew and expand outrag  as such thing grow too import in a realist novel  but his smile was quit slight  the pose of his head polit  the onli uncanni thing was his silenc   as i say  resum the professor  like a man toil through heavi sand   the incid that has occur to us and has led us to ask for inform about the marqui  is one which you may think it better to have narrat  but as it came in the way of comrad syme rather than me  his word he seem to be drag out like word in an anthem  but syme  who was watch  saw his long finger rattl quick on the edg of the crazi tabl  he read the messag   you must go on  this devil has suck me dri  syme plung into the breach with that

two they hope to arrest the marqui in franc  so unless you or i can get on his track  the doctor was still smile in the most friend way  and his protect eye were still impenetr  the professor signal to syme that he would resum his explan  and he began again with the same elabor calm   syme immedi brought this inform to me  and we came here togeth to see what use you would be inclin to make of it  it seem to me unquestion urgent that  all this time syme had been stare at the doctor almost as steadili as the doctor stare at the professor  but quit without the smile  the nerv of both comrad  in  arm were near snap under that strain of motionless amiabl  when syme sudden leant forward and idl tap the edg of the tabl  his messag to his alli ran   i have an intuit  the professor  with scarc a

of lush wood  his companion disdain to repli   or yet again  tap syme   it is posit  as is the passion red hair of a beauti woman  the professor was continu his speech  but in the middl of it syme decid to act  he leant across the tabl  and said in a voic that could not be neglect   dr  bull  the doctor  s sleek and smile head did not move  but they could have sworn that under his dark glass his eye dart toward syme   dr  bull  said syme  in a voic peculiar precis and courteous   would you do me a small favour  would you be so kind as to take off your spectacl  the professor swung round on his seat  and stare at syme with a sort of frozen furi of astonish  syme  like a man who has thrown his life and fortun on the tabl  lean forward with a fieri face  the doctor did not move  for a few second there was a silenc in which one could hear a pin drop  split onc by the singl hoot of a distant steamer on the thame  then dr  bull rose slowli  still smile  and took off his spectacl  syme sprang to his feet  step backward a littl  like a chemic lectur from a success explos  his eye were like star  and for an instant he could onli point without speak  the professor had also start to his feet  forget of his suppos paralysi  he leant on the back of the chair and stare doubt at dr  bull  as if the doctor had been turn into a toad befor his eye  and inde it was almost as great a transform scene  the two detect saw sit in the chair befor them a veri boyish  look young man  with veri frank and happi hazel eye  an open express  cockney cloth like those of a citi clerk  and an unquestion breath about him of be veri good and rather commonplac  the smile was still there  but it might have been the first smile of a babi   i knew i was a poet  cri syme in a sort of ecstasi   i knew my intuit was as infal as the pope  it was the spectacl that did it  it was all the spectacl  given those beast black eye  and all the rest of him his health and his jolli look  made him a live devil among dead one   it certain doe make a queer differ  said the professor shakili   but as regard the project of dr  bull   project be damn  roar syme  besid himself   look at him  look at his face  look at his collar  look at his bless boot  you don  t suppos  do you  that that thing  s an anarchist   syme  cri the other in an apprehens agoni   whi  by god  said syme   i  ll take the risk of that myself  dr  bull  i am a polic offic  there  s my card  and he flung down the blue card upon the tabl  the professor still fear that all was lost  but he was loyal  he pull out his own offici card and put it besid his friend  s  then the third man burst out laugh  and for the first time that morn they heard his voic   i  m aw glad you chap have come so earli  he said  with a sort of schoolboy flippanc   for we can all start for franc togeth  yes  i  m in the forc right enough  and he flick a blue card toward them light as a matter of form  clap a brisk bowler on his head and resum his goblin glass  the doctor move so quick toward the door  that the other instinct follow him  syme seem a littl distrait  and as he pass under the doorway he sudden struck his stick on the stone passag so that it rang   but lord god almighti  he cri out   if this is all right  there were more damn detect than there were damn dynamit at the damn council   we might have fought easili  said bull   we were four against three  the professor was descend the stair  but his voic came up from below   no  said the voic   we were not four against three  we were not so lucki  we were four against one  the other went down the stair in silenc  the young man call bull  with an innoc courtesi characterist of him  insist on go last until they reach the street  but there his own robust rapid assert itself unconsci  and he walk quick on ahead toward a railway inquiri offic  talk to the other over his shoulder   it is jolli to get some pal  he said   i  ve been half dead with the jump  be quit alon  i near flung my arm round gogol and embrac him  which would have been imprud  i hope you won  t despis me for have been in a blue funk   all the blue devil in blue hell  said syme

 i want to go into the detect servic  especi the anti  dynamit busi  but for that purpos they want someon to dress up as a dynamit  and they all swore by blaze that i could never look like a dynamit  they said my veri walk was respect  and that seen from behind i look like the british constitut  they said i look too healthi and too optimist  and too reliabl and benevol  they call me all sort of name at scotland yard  they said that if i had been a crimin  i might have made my fortun by look so like an honest man  but as i had the misfortun to be an honest man  there was not even the remotest chanc of my assist them by ever look like a crimin  but as last i was brought befor some old josser who was high up in the forc  and who seem to have no end of a head on his shoulder  and there the other all talk hopeless  one ask whether a bushi beard would hide my nice smile  anoth said that if they black my face i might look like a negro anarchist  but this old chap chip in with a most extraordinari remark   a pair of smoke spectacl will do it  he said posit   look at him now  he look like an angel offic boy  put him on a pair of smoke spectacl  and children will scream at the sight of him  and so it was  by georg  when onc my eye were cover  all the rest  smile and big shoulder and short hair  made me look a perfect littl devil  as i say  it was simpl enough when it was done  like miracl  but that wasn  t the realli miracul part of it  there was one realli stagger thing about the busi  and my head still turn at it   what was that  ask syme   i  ll tell you  answer the man in spectacl   this big pot in the polic who size me up so that he knew how the goggl would go with my hair and sock  by god  he never saw me at all  syme  s eye sudden flash on him   how was that  he ask   i thought you talk to him   so i did  said bull bright   but we talk in a pitch  dark room like a coalcellar  there  you would never have guess that   i could not have conceiv it  said syme grave   it is inde a new idea  said the professor  their new alli was in practic matter a whirlwind  at the inquiri offic he ask with businesslik breviti about the train for dover  have got his inform  he bundl the compani into a cab  and put them and himself insid a railway carriag befor they had proper realis the breathless process  they were alreadi on the calai boat befor convers flow freeli   i had alreadi arrang  he explain   to go to franc for my lunch  but i am delight to have someon to lunch with me  you see  i had to send that beast  the marqui  over with his bomb  becaus the presid had his eye on me  though god know how  i  ll tell you the stori some day  it was perfect choke  whenev i tri to slip out of it i saw the presid somewher  smile out of the bow  window of a club  or take off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus  i tell you  you can say what you like  that fellow sold himself to the devil  he can be in six place at onc   so you sent the marqui off  i understand  ask the professor   was it long ago  shall we be in time to catch him   yes  answer the new guid   i  ve time it all  he  ll still be at calai when we arriv   but when we do catch him at calai  said the professor   what are we go to do  at this question the counten of dr  bull fell for the first time  he reflect a littl  and then said   theoret  i suppos  we ought to call the polic   not i  said syme   theoret i ought to drown myself first  i promis a poor fellow  who was a real modern pessimist  on my word of honour not to tell the polic  i  m no hand at casuistri  but i can  t break my word to a modern pessimist  it  s like break one  s word to a child   i  m in the same boat  said the professor   i tri to tell the polic and i couldn  t  becaus of some silli oath i took  you see  when i was an actor i was a sort of all  round beast  perjuri or treason is the onli crime i haven  t commit  if i did that i shouldn  t know the differ between right and wrong   i  ve been through all that  said dr  bull   and i  ve made up my mind  i gave my promis to the secretari  you know him  man who smile upsid down  my friend  that man is the most utter unhappi man that was ever human  it may be his digest  or his conscienc  or his nerv  or his philosophi of the univers  but he  s damn  he  s in hell  well  i can  t turn on a man like that  and hunt him down  it  s like whip a leper  i may be mad  but that  s how i feel  and there  s jolli well the end of it   i don  t think you  re mad  said syme   i knew you would decid like that when first you   eh  said dr  bull   when first you took off your spectacl  dr  bull smile a littl  and stroll across the deck to look at the sunlit sea  then he stroll back again  kick his heel careless  and a companion silenc fell between the three men   well  said syme   it seem that we have all the same kind of moral or immor  so we had better face the fact that come of it   yes  assent the professor   you  re quit right  and we must hurri up  for i can see the grey nose stand out from franc   the fact that come of it  said syme serious   is this  that we three are alon on this planet  gogol has gone  god know where  perhap the presid has smash him like a fli  on the council we are three men against three  like the roman who held the bridg  but we are wors off than that  first becaus they can appeal to their organ and we cannot appeal to our  and second becaus   becaus one of those other three men  said the professor   is not a man  syme nod and was silent for a second or two  then he said   my idea is this  we must do someth to keep the marqui in calai till tomorrow midday  i have turn over twenti scheme in my head  we cannot denounc him as a dynamit  that is agre  we cannot get him detain on some trivial charg  for we should have to appear  he know us  and he would smell a rat  we cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist busi  he might swallow much in that way  but not the notion of stop in calai while the czar went safe through pari  we might tri to kidnap him  and lock him up ourselv  but he is a well  known man here  he has a whole bodyguard of friend  he is veri strong and brave  and the event is doubt  the onli thing i can see to do is actual to take advantag of the veri thing that are in the marqui  s favour  i am go to profit by the fact that he is a high respect nobleman  i am go to profit by the fact that he has mani friend and move in the best societi   what the devil are you talk about  ask the professor   the syme are first mention in the fourteenth centuri  said syme   but

about the spectacl  poetic intuit  and they sometim rose to the exalt of propheci  he had correct calcul in this case the polici of his oppon  when the marqui was inform by his second that syme could onli fight in the morn  he must fulli have realis that an obstacl had sudden arisen between him and his bomb  throw busi in the capit  natur he could not explain this object to his friend  so he chose the cours which syme had predict  he induc his second to settl on a small meadow not far from the railway  and he trust to the fatal of the first engag  when he came down veri coolli to the field of honour  no one could have guess that he had ani anxieti about a journey  his hand were in his pocket  his straw hat on the back of his head  his handsom face brazen in the sun  but it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appear in his train  not onli his second carri the sword  case  but two of his servant carri a portmanteau and a luncheon basket  earli as was the hour  the sun soak everyth in warmth  and syme was vagu surpris to see so mani spring flower burn gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole compani stood almost knee  deep  with the except of the marqui  all the men were in sombr and solemn morn  dress  with hat like black chimney  pot  the littl doctor especi  with the addit of his black spectacl  look like an undertak in a farc  syme could not help feel a comic contrast between this funer church parad of apparel and the rich and glisten meadow  grow wild flower everywher  but  inde  this comic contrast between the yellow blossom and the black hat was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossom and the black busi  on his right was a littl wood  far away to his left lay the long curv of the railway line  which he was  so to speak  guard from the marqui  whose goal and escap it was  in front of him  behind the black group of his oppon  he could see  like a tint cloud  a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea  the member of the legion of honour  whose name it seem was colonel ducroix  approach the professor and dr  bull with great polit  and suggest that the play should termin with the first consider hurt  dr  bull  howev  have been care coach by syme upon this point of polici  insist  with great digniti and in veri bad french  that it should continu until one of the combat was disabl  syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabl the marqui and prevent the marqui from disabl him for at least twenti minut  in twenti minut the pari train would have gone by   to a man of the well  known skill and valour of monsieur de st  eustach  said the professor solemn   it must be a matter of indiffer which method is adopt  and our princip has strong reason for demand the longer encount  reason the delicaci of which prevent me from be explicit  but for the just and honour natur of which i can   pest  broke from the marqui behind  whose face had sudden darken   let us stop talk and begin  and he slash off the head of a tall flower with his stick  syme understood his rude impati and instinct look over his shoulder to see whether the train was come in sight  but there was no smoke on the horizon  colonel ducroix knelt down and unlock the case  take out a pair of twin sword  which took the sunlight and turn to two streak of white fire  he offer one to the marqui  who snatch it without ceremoni  and anoth to syme  who took it  bent it  and pois it with as much delay as was consist with digniti  then the colonel took out anoth pair of blade  and take one himself and give anoth to dr  bull  proceed to place the men  both combat had thrown off their coat and waistcoat  and stood sword in hand  the second stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn sword also  but still sombr in their dark frock  coat and hat  the princip salut  the colonel said quiet   engag  and the two blade touch and tingl  when the jar of the join iron ran up syme  s arm  all the fantast fear that have been the subject of this stori fell from him like dream from a man wake up in bed  he rememb them clear and in order as mere delus of the nerv  how the fear of the professor had been the fear of the tyrann accid of nightmar  and how the fear of the doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of scienc  the first was the old fear that ani miracl might happen  the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracl can ever happen  but he saw that these fear were fanci  for he found himself in the presenc of the great fact of the fear of death  with it coars and pitiless common sens  he felt like a man who had dream all night of fall over precipic  and had woke up on the morn when he was to be hang  for as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe  s foreshorten blade  and as soon as he had felt the two tongu of steel touch  vibrat like two live thing  he knew that his enemi was a terribl fighter  and that probabl his last hour had come  he felt a strang and vivid valu in all the earth around him  in the grass under his feet  he felt the love of life in all live thing  he could almost fanci that he heard the grass grow  he could almost fanci that even as he stood fresh flower were spring up and break into blossom in the meadow  flower blood red and burn gold and blue  fulfil the whole pageant of the spring  and whenev his eye stray for a flash from the calm  stare  hypnot eye of the marqui  they saw the littl tuft of almond tree against the sky  line  he had the feel that if by some miracl he escap he would be readi to sit for ever befor that almond tree  desir noth els in the world  but while earth and sky and everyth had the live beauti of a thing lost  the other half of his head was as clear as glass  and he was parri his enemi  s point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hard suppos himself capabl  onc his enemi  s point ran along his wrist  leav a slight streak of blood  but it either was not notic or was tacit ignor  everi now and then he ripost  and onc or twice he could almost fanci that he felt his point go home  but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he suppos he was mistaken  then came an interrupt and a chang  at the risk of lose all  the marqui  interrupt his quiet stare  flash one glanc over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right  then he turn on syme a face transfigur to that of a fiend  and began to fight as if with twenti weapon  the attack came so fast and furious  that the one shine sword seem a shower of shine arrow  syme had no chanc to look at the railway  but also he had no need  he could guess the reason of the marqui  s sudden mad of battl  the pari train was in sight  but the marqui  s morbid energi over  reach itself  twice syme  parri  knock his oppon  s point far out of the fight circl  and the third time his ripost was so rapid  that there was no doubt about the hit this time  syme  s sword actual bent under the weight of the marqui  s bodi  which it had pierc  syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemi as a garden that he has stuck his spade into the ground  yet the marqui sprang back from the stroke without a stagger  and syme stood stare at his own sword  point like an idiot  there was no blood on it at all  there was an instant of rigid silenc  and then syme in his turn fell furious on the other  fill with a flame curios  the marqui was probabl  in a general sens  a better fencer than he  as he had surmis at the begin  but at the moment the marqui seem distraught and at a disadvantag  he fought wild and even weak  and he constant look away at the railway line  almost as if he fear the train more than the point steel  syme  on the other hand  fought fierc but still care  in an intellectu furi  eager to solv the riddl of his own bloodless sword  for this purpos  he aim less at the marqui  s bodi  and more at his throat and head  a minut and a half afterward he felt his point enter the man  s neck below the jaw  it came out clean  half mad  he thrust again  and made what should have been a bloodi scar on the marqui  s cheek  but there was no scar  for one moment the heaven of syme again grew black with supernatur terror  sure the man had a charm life  but this new spiritu dread was a more aw thing than had been the mere spiritu topsi  turvydom symbolis by the paralyt who pursu him  the professor was onli a goblin  this man was a devil  perhap he was the devil  anyhow  this was certain  that three time had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark  when syme had that thought he drew himself up  and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sing in the tree  he thought of all the human thing in his stori  of the chines

conspiraci  a secret societi of anarchist is hunt us like hare  not such unfortun madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvat or german philosophi  but a rich and power and fanat church  a church of eastern pessim  which hold it holi to destroy mankind like vermin  how hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguis as those for which i apologis  and to such prank as this one by which you suffer   the younger second of the marqui  a short man with a black moustach  bow polit  and said   of cours  i accept the apolog  but you will in your turn forgiv me if i declin to follow you further into your difficulti  and permit myself to say good morn  the sight of an acquaint and distinguish fellow  townsman come to piec in the open air is unusu

see them through it  i have fought for franc  and it is hard if i can  t fight for civil  dr  bull took off his hat and wave it  cheer as at a public meet   don  t make too much nois  said inspector ratcliff   sunday may hear you   sunday  cri bull  and drop his hat   yes  retort ratcliff   he may be with them   with whom  ask syme   with the peopl out of that train  said the other   what you say seem utter wild  began syme   whi  as a matter of fact  but  my god  he cri out sudden  like a man who see an explos a long way off   by god  if this is true the whole balli lot of us on the anarchist council were against anarchi  everi born man was a detect except the presid and his person secretari  what can it mean   mean  said the new policeman with incred violenc   it mean that we are struck dead  don  t you know sunday  don  t you know that his joke are alway so big and simpl that one has never thought of them  can you think of anyth more like sunday than this  that he should put all his power enemi on the suprem council  and then take care that it was not suprem  i tell you he has bought everi trust  he has captur everi cabl  he has control of everi railway line  especi of that railway line  and he point a shake finger toward the small waysid station   the whole movement was control by him  half the world was readi to rise for him  but there were just five peopl  perhap  who would have resist him    and the old devil put them on the suprem council  to wast their time in watch each other  idiot that we are  he plan the whole of our idioci  sunday knew that the professor would chase syme through london  and that syme would fight me in franc  and he was combin great mass of capit  and seiz great line of telegraphi  while we five idiot were run after each other like a lot of confound babi play blind man  s buff   well  ask syme with a sort of steadi   well  repli the other with sudden seren   he has found us play blind man  s buff today in a field of great rustic beauti and extrem solitud  he has probabl captur the world  it onli remain to him to captur this field and all the fool in it  and sinc you realli want to know what was my object to the arriv of that train  i will tell you  my object was that sunday or his secretari has just this moment got out of it  syme utter an involuntari cri  and they all turn their eye toward the far  off station  it was quit true that a consider bulk of peopl seem to be move in their direct  but they were too distant to be distinguish in ani way   it was a habit of the late marqui de st  eustach  said the new policeman  produc a leather case   alway to carri a pair of opera glass  either the presid or the secretari is come after us with that mob  they have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptat to break our oath by call the polic  dr  bull  i have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own high decor spectacl  he hand the field  glass to the doctor  who immedi took off his spectacl and put the apparatus to his eye   it cannot be as bad as you say  said the professor  somewhat shaken   there are a good number of them certain  but they may easili be ordinari tourist   do ordinari tourist  ask bull  with the fieldglass to his eye   wear black mask half  way down the face  syme almost tore the glass out of his hand  and look through them  most men in the advanc mob realli look ordinari enough  but it was quit true that two or three of the leader in front wore black half  mask almost down to their mouth  this disguis is veri complet  especi at such a distanc  and syme found it imposs to conclud anyth from the clean  shaven jaw and chin of the men talk in the front  but present as they talk they all smile and one of them smile on one side  chapter xi the crimin chase the polic syme put the field  glass from his eye with an almost ghast relief   the presid is not with them  anyhow  he said  and wipe his forehead   but sure they are right away on the horizon  said the bewild colonel  blink and but half recov from bull  s hasti though polit explan   could you possibl know your presid among all those peopl   could i know a white eleph among all those peopl  answer syme somewhat irrit   as you veri truli say  they are on the horizon  but if he were walk with them    by god  i believ this ground would shake  after an instant  s paus the new man call ratcliff said with gloomi decis   of cours the presid isn  t with them  i wish to gemini he were  much more like the presid is ride in triumph through pari  or sit on the ruin of st  paul  s cathedr   this is absurd  said syme   someth may have happen in our absenc  but he cannot have carri the world with a rush like that  it is quit true  he ad  frown dubious at the distant field that lay toward the littl station   it is certain true that there seem to be a crowd come this way  but they are not all the armi that you make out   oh  they  said the new detect contemptu   no they are not a veri valuabl forc  but let me tell you frank that they are precis calcul to our valu  we are not much  my boy  in sunday  s univers  he has got hold of all the cabl and telegraph himself  but to kill the suprem council he regard as a trivial matter  like a post card  it may be left to his privat secretari  and he spat on the grass  then he turn to the other and said somewhat auster   there is a great deal to be said for death  but if anyon has ani prefer for the other altern  i strong advis him to walk after me  with these word  he turn his broad back and strode with silent energi toward the wood  the other gave one glanc over their shoulder  and saw that the dark cloud of men had detach itself from the station and was move with a mysteri disciplin across the plain  they saw alreadi  even with the nake eye  black blot on the foremost face  which mark the mask they wore  they turn and follow their leader  who had alreadi struck the wood  and disappear among the twinkl tree  the sun on the grass was dri and hot  so in plung into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow  as of diver who plung into a dim pool  the insid of the wood was full of shatter sunlight and shaken shadow  they made a sort of shudder veil  almost recal the dizzi of a cinematograph  even the solid figur walk with him syme could hard see for the pattern of sun and shade that danc upon them  now a man  s head was lit as with a light of rembrandt  leav all els obliter  now again he had strong and stare white hand with the face of a negro  the ex  marqui had pull the old straw hat over his eye  and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squar in two that it seem to be wear one of the black half  mask of their pursuer  the fanci tint syme  s overwhelm sens of wonder  was he wear a mask  was anyon wear a mask  was anyon anyth  this wood of witcheri  in which men  s face turn black and white by turn  in which their figur first swell into sunlight and then fade into formless night  this mere chao of chiaroscuro  after the clear daylight outsid  seem to syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been move for three day  this world where men took off their beard and their spectacl and their nose  and turn into other peopl  that tragic self  confid which he had felt when he believ that the marqui was a devil had strang disappear now that he knew that the marqui was a friend  he felt almost inclin to ask after all these bewilder what was a friend and what an enemi  was there anyth that was apart from what it seem  the marqui had taken off his nose and turn out to be a detect  might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin  was not everyth  after all  like this bewild woodland  this danc of dark and light  everyth onli a glimps  the glimps alway unforeseen  and alway forgotten  for gabriel syme had found in the heart of that sun  splash wood what mani modern painter had found there  he had found the thing which the modern peopl call impression  which is anoth name for that final sceptic which can find no floor to the univers  as a man in an evil dream strain himself to scream and wake  syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fanci  with two impati stride he overtook the man in the marqui  s straw hat  the man whom he had come to address as ratcliff  in a voic exagg loud and cheer  he broke the bottomless silenc and made convers   may i ask  he said   where on earth we are all go to   so genuin had been the doubt of his soul  that he was quit glad to hear his companion speak in an easi  human voic   we must get down through the town of lanci to the sea  he said   i think that part of the countri is least like to be with them   what can you mean by all this  cri syme   they can  t be run the real world in that way  sure not mani work men are anarchist  and sure if they were  mere mob could not beat modern armi and polic   mere mob  repeat his new friend with a snort of scorn   so you talk about mob and the work class as if they were the question  you  ve got that etern idiot idea that if anarchi came it would come from the poor  whi should it  the poor have been rebel  but they have never been anarchist  they have more interest than anyon els in there be some decent govern  the poor man realli has a stake in the countri  the rich man hasn  t  he can go away to new guinea in a yacht  the poor have sometim object to be govern bad  the rich have alway object to be govern at all  aristocrat were alway anarchist  as you can see from the baron  war   as a lectur on english histori for the littl one  said syme   this is all veri nice  but i have not yet grasp it applic   it applic is  said his inform   that most of old sunday  s right  hand men are south african and american millionair  that is whi he has got hold of all the communic  and that is whi the last four champion of the anti  anarchist polic forc are run through a wood like rabbit   millionair i can understand  said syme thought   they are near all mad  but get hold of a few wick old gentlemen with hobbi is one thing  get hold of great christian nation is anoth  i would bet the nose off my face  forgiv the allus  that sunday would stand perfect helpless befor the task of convert ani ordinari healthi person anywher   well  said the other   it rather depend what sort of person you mean   well  for instanc  said syme   he could never convert that person  and he point straight in front of him  they had come to an open space of sunlight  which seem to express to syme the final return of his own good sens  and in the middl of this forest clear was a figur that might well stand for that common sens in an almost aw actual  burnt by the sun and stain with perspir  and grave with the bottomless graviti of small necessari toil  a heavi french peasant was cut wood with a hatchet  his cart stood a few yard off  alreadi half full of timber  and the hors that crop the grass was  like his master  valor but not desper  like his master  he was even prosper  but yet was almost sad  the man was a norman  taller than the averag of the french and veri angular  and his swarthi figur stood dark against a squar of sunlight  almost like some allegor figur of labour fresco on a ground of gold   mr  syme is say  call out ratcliff to the french colonel   that this man  at least  will never be an anarchist   mr  syme is right enough there  answer colonel ducroix  laugh   if onli for the reason that he has plenti of properti to defend  but i forgot that in your countri you are not use to peasant be wealthi   he look poor  said dr  bull doubt   quit so  said the colonel   that is whi he is rich   i have an idea  call out dr  bull sudden   how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart  those dog are all on foot  and we could soon leav them behind   oh  give him anyth  said syme eager   i have pile of money on me   that will never do  said the colonel   he will never have ani respect for you unless you drive a bargain   oh  if he haggl  began bull impati   eri haggl becaus he is a free man  said the other   you do not understand  he would not see the mean of generos  he is not be tip  and even while they seem to hear the heavi feet of their strang pursuer behind them  they had to stand and stamp while the french colonel talk to the french wood  cutter with all the leisur badinag and bicker of market  day  at the end of the four minut  howev  they saw that the colonel was right  for the wood  cutter enter into their plan  not with the vagu servil of a tout too  well paid  but with the serious of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee  he told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the littl inn on the hill abov lanci  where the innkeep  an old soldier who had becom devot in his latter year  would be certain to sympathis with them  and even to take risk in their support  the whole compani  therefor  pile themselv on top of the stack of wood  and went rock in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland  heavi and ramshackl as was the vehicl  it was driven quick enough  and they soon had the exhilar impress of distanc altogeth those  whoever they were  who were hunt them  for  after all  the riddl as to where the anarchist had got all these follow was still unsolv  one man  s presenc had suffic for them  they had fled at the first sight of the deform smile of the secretari  syme everi now and then look back over his shoulder at the armi on their track  as the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distanc  he could see the sunlit slope beyond it and abov it  and across these was still move the squar black mob like one monstrous beetl  in the veri strong sunlight and with his own veri strong eye  which were almost telescop  syme could see this mass of men quit plain  he could see them as separ human figur  but he was increas surpris by the way in which they move as one man  they seem to be dress in dark cloth and plain hat  like ani common crowd out of the street  but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various line to the attack  as would be natur in an ordinari mob  they move with a sort of dread and wick wooden  like a stare armi of automaton  syme point this out to ratcliff   yes  repli the policeman   that  s disciplin  that  s sunday  he is perhap five hundr mile off  but the fear of him is on all of them  like the finger of god  yes  they are walk regular  and you bet your boot that they are talk regular  yes  and think regular  but the one import thing for us is that they are disappear regular  syme nod  it was true that the black patch of the pursu men was grow smaller and smaller as the peasant belabour his hors  the level of the sunlit landscap  though flat as a whole  fell away on the farther side of the wood in billow of heavi slope toward the sea  in a way not unlik the lower slope of the sussex down  the onli differ was that in sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a littl brook  but here the white french road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfal  down this direct descent the cart clatter at a consider angl  and in a few minut  the road grow yet steeper  they saw below them the littl harbour of lanci and a great blue arc of the sea  the travel cloud of their enemi had wholli disappear from the horizon  the hors and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elm  and the hors  s nose near struck the face of an old gentleman who was sit on the bench outsid the littl cafe of  le soleil d  or  the peasant grunt an apolog  and got down from his seat  the other also descend one by one  and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentari phrase of courtesi  for it was quit evid from his expans manner that he was the owner of the littl tavern  he was a white  hair  appl  face old boy  with sleepi eye and a grey moustach  stout  sedentari  and veri innoc  of a type that may often be found in franc  but is still common in cathol germani  everyth about him  his pipe  his pot of beer  his flower  and his beehiv  suggest an ancestr peac  onli when his visitor look up as they enter the inn  parlour  they saw the sword upon the wall  the colonel  who greet the innkeep as an old friend  pass rapid into the inn  parlour  and sat down order some ritual refresh  the militari decis of his action interest syme  who sat next to him  and he took the opportun when the old innkeep had gone out of satisfi his curios   may i ask you  colonel  he said in a low voic   whi we have come here  colonel ducroix smile behind his brist white moustach   for two reason  sir  he said   and i will give first  not the most import  but the most utilitarian  we came here becaus this is the onli place within twenti mile in which we can get hors   hors  repeat syme  look up quick   yes  repli the other   if you peopl are realli to distanc your enemi it is hors or noth for you  unless of cours you have bicycl and motor  car in your pocket   and where do you advis us to make for  ask syme doubt   beyond question  repli the colonel   you had better make all hast to the polic station beyond the town  my friend  whom i second under somewhat decept circumst  seem to me to exagger veri much the possibl of a general rise  but even he would hard maintain  i suppos  that you were not safe with the gendarm  syme nod grave  then he said abrupt   and your other reason for come here   my other reason for come here  said ducroix sober   is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibl near to death  syme look up at the wall  and saw a crude  paint and pathet religi pictur  then he said   you are right  and then almost immedi afterward   has anyon seen about the hors   yes  answer ducroix   you may be quit certain that i gave order the moment i came in  those enemi of your gave no impress of hurri  but they were realli move wonder fast  like a well  train armi  i had no idea that the anarchist had so much disciplin  you have not a moment to wast  almost as he spoke  the old innkeep with the blue eye and white hair came ambl into the room  and announc that six hors were saddl outsid  by ducroix  s advic the five other equip themselv with some portabl form of food and wine  and keep their duell sword as the onli weapon avail  they clatter away down the steep  white road  the two servant  who had carri the marqui  s luggag when he was a marqui  were left behind to drink at the cafe by common consent  and not at all against their own inclin  by this time the afternoon sun was slant westward  and by it ray syme could see the sturdi figur of the old innkeep grow smaller and smaller  but still stand and look after them quit silent  the sunshin in his silver hair  syme had a fix  superstiti fanci  left in his mind by the chanc phrase of the colonel  that this was inde  perhap  the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth  he was still look at this dwindl figur  which stood as a mere grey blot touch with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him  and as he stare over the top of the down behind the innkeep  there appear an armi of black  clad and march men  they seem to hang abov the good man and his hous like a black cloud of locust  the hors had been saddl none too soon  chapter xii the earth in anarchi urg the hors to a gallop  without respect to the rather rug descent of the road  the horsemen soon regain their advantag over the men on the march  and at last the bulk of the first build of lanci cut off the sight of their pursuer  nevertheless  the ride had been a long one  and by the time they reach the real town the west was warm with the colour and qualiti of sunset  the colonel suggest that  befor make final for the polic station  they should make the effort  in pass  to attach to themselv one more individu who might be use   four out of the five rich men in this town  he said   are common swindler  i suppos the proport is pretti equal all over the world  the fifth is a friend of mine  and a veri fine fellow  and what is even more import from our point of view  he own a motor  car   i am afraid  said the professor in his mirth way  look back along the white road on which the black  crawl patch might appear at ani moment   i am afraid we have hard time for afternoon call   doctor renard  s hous is onli three minut off  said the colonel   our danger  said dr  bull   is not two minut off   yes  said syme   if we ride on fast we must leav them behind  for they are on foot   he has a motor  car  said the colonel   but we may not get it  said bull   yes  he is quit on your side   but he might be out   hold your tongu  said syme sudden   what is that nois  for a second they all sat as still as equestrian statu  and for a second  for two or three or four second  heaven and earth seem equal still  then all their ear  in an agoni of attent  heard along the road that indescrib thrill and throb that mean onli one thing  hors  the colonel  s face had an instantan chang  as if lightn had struck it  and yet left it scatheless   they have done us  he said  with brief militari ironi   prepar to receiv cavalri   where can they have got the hors  ask syme  as he mechan urg his steed to a canter  the colonel was silent for a littl  then he said in a strain voic   i was speak with strict accuraci when i said that the  soleil d  or  was the onli place where one can get hors within twenti mile   no  said syme violent   i don  t believ he  d do it  not with all that white hair   he may have been forc  said the colonel gentl   they must be at least a hundr strong  for which reason we are all go to see my friend renard  who has a motor  car  with these word he swung his hors sudden round a street corner  and went down the street with such thunder speed  that the other  though alreadi well at the gallop  had difficulti in follow the fli tail of his hors  dr  renard inhabit a high and comfort hous at the top of a steep street  so that when the rider alight at his door they could onc more see the solid green ridg of the hill  with the white road across it  stand up abov all the roof of the town  they breath again to see that the road as yet was clear  and they rang the bell  dr  renard was a beam  brown  beard man  a good exampl of that silent but veri busi profession class which franc has preserv even more perfect than england  when the matter was explain to him he pooh  pooh the panic of the ex  marqui altogeth  he said  with the solid french sceptic  that there was no conceiv probabl of a general anarchist rise   anarchi  he said  shrug his shoulder   it is childish   et ca  cri out the colonel sudden  point over the other  s shoulder   and that is childish  isn  t it  they all look round  and saw a curv of black cavalri come sweep over the top of the hill with all the energi of attila  swift as they rode  howev  the whole rank still kept well togeth  and they could see the black vizard of the first line as level as a line of uniform  but although the main black squar was the same  though travel faster  there was now one sensat differ which they could see clear upon the slope of the hill  as if upon a slant map  the bulk of the rider were in one block  but one rider flew far ahead of the column  and with frantic movement of hand and heel urg his hors faster and faster  so that one might have fanci that he was not the pursuer but the pursu  but even at that great distanc they could see someth so fanat  so unquestion in his figur  that they knew it was the secretari himself   i am sorri to cut short a cultur discuss  said the colonel   but can you lend me your

dr  renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth  his room were like the muse de cluni  and he had three motor  car  these  howev  he seem to use veri spare  have the simpl tast of the french middl class  and when his impati friend came to examin them  it took them some time to assur themselv that one of them even could be made to work  this with some difficulti they brought round into the street befor the doctor  s hous  when they came out of the dim garag they were startl to find that twilight had alreadi fallen with the abrupt of night in the tropic  either they had been longer in

horseman  who had left it far behind  the insan secretari  syme  s famili  like most of those who end in the simpl life  had onc own a motor  and he knew all about them  he had leapt at onc into the chauffeur  s seat  and with flush face was wrench and tug at the disus machineri  he bent his strength upon one handl  and then said quit quiet   i am afraid it  s no go  as he spoke  there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rush hors  with the rush and rigid of an arrow  he had a smile that thrust out his chin as if it were disloc  he swept alongsid of the stationari car  into which it compani had crowd  and laid his hand on the front  it was the secretari  and his mouth went quit straight in the solemn of triumph  syme was lean hard upon the steer wheel  and there was no sound but the rumbl of the other pursuer ride into the town  then there came quit sudden a scream of scrape iron  and the car leapt forward  it pluck the secretari clean out of his saddl  as a knife is whip out of it sheath  trail him kick terribl for twenti yard  and left him flung flat upon the road far in front of his frighten hors  as the car took the corner of the street with a splendid curv  they could just see the other anarchist fill the street and rais their fallen leader   i can  t understand whi it has grown so dark  said the professor at last in a low voic   go to be a storm  i think  said dr

lantern over the front  there was a certain allegori of their whole posit in the contrast between the modern automobil and it strang ecclesiast lamp  hitherto they had pass through the quietest part of the town  meet at most one or two pedestrian  who could give them no hint of the peac or the hostil of the place  now  howev  the window in the hous began one by one to be lit up  give a greater

his brow togeth   there is onli one set of light that make me more cheer  he said   and they are those light of the polic station which i can see beyond the town  pleas god we may be there in ten minut  then all bull  s boil good sens and optim broke sudden out of him   oh  this is all rave nonsens  he cri   if you realli think that ordinari peopl in ordinari hous are anarchist  you must be

while they were speak the professor had leant forward with sudden excit   what is that nois  he said   oh  the hors behind us  i suppos  said the colonel   i thought we had got clear of them   the

whole town is on their side   you still believ that  ask the colonel incredul   you will all believ it soon  said the other with a hopeless calm  there was a puzzl paus for some littl time  and then the colonel began again abrupt   no  i can  t believ it  the thing is nonsens  the plain peopl of a peaceabl french town  he was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light  which seem close to his eye  as the car sped on it left a float patch of white smoke behind it  and syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear   my god  said the colonel   someon has shot at us   it need not interrupt convers  said the gloomi ratcliff   pray resum your remark  colonel  you were talk  i think  about the plain peopl of a peaceabl french town  the stare colonel was long past mind satir  he roll his eye all

road  syme had slow down the car as their plan becam doubt  and he brought it final to a standstil just at the corner of a side street that ran down veri steepli to the sea  the town was most in shadow  but the sun had not sunk  wherev it level light could break through  it paint everyth a burn gold  up this side street the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of artifici light at the theatr  it struck the car of the five friend  and lit it like a burn chariot  but the rest of the street  especi the two end of it  was in the deepest twilight  and for some second they could see noth  then syme  whose eye were the keenest  broke into a littl bitter whistl  and said  it is quit true  there is a crowd or an armi or some such thing across the end of that street   well  if there is  said bull impati   it must be someth els  a sham fight or the mayor  s birthday or someth  i cannot and will not believ that plain  jolli peopl in a place like this walk about with

he saw an irregular bodi of horsemen gather and gallop toward them in the gloom  he saw abov the foremost saddl the silver gleam of a sword  and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man  s hair  the next moment  with shatter violenc  he had swung the motor round and sent it dash down the steep side street to the sea  like a man that desir onli to die   what the devil is up  cri the professor  seiz his arm   the morn star has fallen  said syme  as his own car went down the dark like a fall star  the other did not understand his word  but when they look back at the street abov

keep after me  they follow him as he went crunch down the beach  and in a second or two their boot broke not on the sea gravel  but on broad  flat stone  they march down a long  low jetti  run out in one arm into the dim  boil sea  and when they came to the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their stori  they turn and face the town  that town was transfigur with uproar  all along the high parad from which they had just descend was a dark and roar stream of human  with toss arm and fieri face  grope and glare toward them  the long dark line was dot with torch and lantern  but even where no flame lit up a furious face  they could see in the farthest figur  in the most shadowi gestur  an organis hate  it was clear that they were the accurs of all men  and they knew not whi  two or three men  look littl and black like monkey  leapt over the edg as they had done and drop on to the beach  these came plough down the deep sand  shout horribl  and strove to wade into the sea at random  the exampl was follow  and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edg like black treacl  foremost among the men on the beach syme saw the peasant who had driven their

queer about a captiv balloon   noth  said syme   except that it isn  t captiv  they all turn their eye to where the balloon swung and swell abov the exhibit on a string  like a child  s balloon  a second afterward the string came in two just under the car  and the balloon  broken loos  float away with the freedom of a soap bubbl   ten thousand devil  shriek the secretari   he  s got into it  and he shook his fist at the sky  the balloon  born by some chanc wind  came right abov them  and they could see the great white head of the presid peer over the side and look benevol down on them   god bless my soul  said the professor with the elder manner that he could never disconnect from his bleach beard and parchment face   god bless my soul  i seem to fanci that someth fell on the top of

across south england in hansom  cab  but he was ultim convinc of the persist refus of the balloon to follow the road  and the still more persist refus of the cabmen to follow the balloon  consequ the tireless though exasper travel broke through black thicket and plough through plough field till each was turn into a figur too outrag to be mistaken for a tramp  those green hill of surrey saw the final collaps and tragedi of the admir light grey suit in which syme had set out from saffron park  his silk hat was broken over his nose by a swing bough  his coat  tail were torn to the shoulder by arrest thorn  the clay of england was splash up to his collar  but he still carri his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determin  and his eye were still fix on that float ball of gas  which in the full flush of sunset seem colour like a sunset cloud   after all  he said   it is veri beauti   it is singular and strang beauti  said the professor   i wish the beast gas  bag would burst   no  said dr  bull   i hope it won  t  it might hurt the old boy   hurt him  said the vindict professor   hurt him  not as much as i  d hurt him if i could get up with him  littl snowdrop   i don  t want him hurt  somehow  said dr  bull   what  cri the secretari bitter   do you believ all that tale about his be our man in the dark room  sunday would say he was anybodi   i don  t know whether i believ it or not  said dr  bull   but it isn  t that that i mean  i can  t wish old sunday  s balloon to burst becaus   well  said syme impati   becaus   well  becaus he  s so jolli like a balloon himself  said dr  bull desper   i don  t understand a word of all that idea of his be the same man who gave us all our blue card  it seem to make everyth nonsens  but i don  t care who know it  i alway had a sympathi for old sunday himself  wick as he was  just as if he was a great bounc babi  how can i explain what my queer sympathi was  it didn  t prevent my fight him like hell  shall i make it clear if i say that i like him becaus he was so fat   you will not  said the secretari   i  ve got it now  cri bull   it was becaus he was so fat and so light  just like a balloon  we alway think of fat peopl as heavi  but he could have danc against a sylph  i see now what i mean  moder strength is shown in violenc  suprem strength is shown in leviti  it was like the old specul  what would happen if an eleph could leap up in the sky like a grasshopp   our eleph  said syme  look upward   has leapt into the sky like a grasshopp   and somehow  conclud bull   that  s whi i can  t help like old sunday  no  it  s not an admir of forc  or ani silli thing like that  there is a kind of gaieti in the thing  as if he were burst with some good news  haven  t you sometim felt it on a spring day  you know natur play trick  but somehow that day prove they are good  natur trick  i never read the bibl myself  but that part they laugh at is liter truth   whi leap ye  ye high hill  the hill do leap  at least  they tri to     whi do i like sunday     how can i tell you     becaus he  s such a bounder  there was a long silenc  and then the secretari said in a curious  strain voic   you do not know sunday at all  perhap it is becaus you are better than i  and do not know hell  i was a fierc fellow  and a trifl morbid from the first  the man who sit in dark  and who chose us all  chose me becaus i had all the crazi look of a conspir  becaus my smile went crook  and my eye were gloomi  even when i smile  but there must have been someth in me that answer to the nerv in all these anarch men  for when i first saw sunday he express to me  not your airi vital  but someth both gross and sad in the natur of thing  i found him smoke in a twilight room  a room with brown blind down  infinit more depress than the genial dark in which our master live  he sat there on a bench  a huge heap of a man  dark and out of shape  he listen to all my word without speak or even stir  i pour out my most passion appeal  and ask my most eloqu question  then  after a long silenc  the thing began to shake  and i thought it was shaken by some secret maladi  it shook like a loathsom and live jelli  it remind me of everyth i had ever read about the base bodi that are the origin of life  the deep sea lump and protoplasm  it seem like the final form of matter  the most shapeless and the most shame  i could onli tell myself  from it shudder  that it was someth at least that such a monster could be miser  and then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shake with a lone laughter  and the laughter was at me  do you ask me to forgiv him that  it is no small thing to be laugh at by someth at onc lower and stronger than oneself   sure you fellow are exagger wild  cut in the clear voic of inspector ratcliff   presid sunday is a terribl fellow for one  s intellect  but he is not such a barnum  s freak physic as you make out  he receiv me in an ordinari offic  in a grey check coat  in broad daylight  he talk to me in an ordinari way  but i  ll tell you what is a trifl creepi about sunday  his room is neat  his cloth are neat  everyth seem in order  but he  s absent  mind  sometim his great bright eye go quit blind  for hour he forget that you are there  now absent  minded is just a bit too aw in a bad man  we think of a wick man as vigil  we can  t think of a wick man who is honest and sincer dreami  becaus we daren  t think of a wick man alon with himself  an absentmind man mean a good  natur man  it mean a man who  if he happen to see you  will apologis  but how will you bear an absentmind man who  if he happen to see you  will kill you  that is what tri the nerv  abstract combin with cruelti  men have felt it sometim when they went through wild forest  and felt that the anim there were at onc innoc and pitiless  they might ignor or slay  how would you like to pass ten mortal hour in a parlour with an absent  mind tiger   and what do you think of sunday  gogol  ask syme   i don  t think of sunday on principl  said gogol simpli   ani more than i stare at the sun at noonday   well  that is a point of view  said syme thought   what do you say  professor  the professor was walk with bent head and trail stick  and he did not answer at all   wake up  professor  said syme genial   tell us what you think of sunday  the professor spoke at last veri slowli   i think someth  he said   that i cannot say clear  or  rather  i think someth that i cannot even think clear  but it is someth like this  my earli life  as you know  was a bit too larg and loos  well  when i saw sunday  s face i thought it was too larg  everybodi doe  but i also thought it was too loos  the face was so big  that one couldn  t focus it or make it a face at all  the eye was so far away from the nose  that it wasn  t an eye  the mouth was so much by itself  that one had to think of it by itself  the whole thing is too hard to explain  he paus for a littl  still trail his stick  and then went on   but put it this way  walk up a road at night  i have seen a lamp and a light window and a cloud make togeth a most complet and unmistak face  if anyon in heaven has that face i shall know him again  yet when i walk a littl farther i found that there was no face  that the window was ten yard away  the lamp ten hundr yard  the cloud beyond the world  well  sunday  s face escap me  it ran away to right and left  as such chanc pictur run away  and so his face has made me  somehow  doubt whether there are ani face  i don  t know whether your face  bull  is a face or a combin in perspect  perhap one black disc of your beast glass is quit close and anoth fifti mile away  oh  the doubt of a materialist are not worth a dump  sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubt  the doubt of a spiritualist  i am a buddhist  i suppos  and buddhism is not a creed  it is a doubt  my poor dear bull  i do not believ that you realli have a face  i have not faith enough to believ in matter  syme  s eye were still fix upon the errant orb  which  redden in the even light  look like some rosier and more innoc world   have you notic an odd thing  he said   about all your descript  each man of you find sunday quit differ  yet each man of you can onli find one thing to compar him to  the univers itself  bull find him like the earth in spring  gogol like the sun at noonday  the secretari is remind of the shapeless protoplasm  and the inspector of the careless of virgin forest  the professor say he is like a chang landscap  this is queer  but it is queerer still that i also have had my odd notion about the presid  and i also find that i think of sunday as i think of the whole world   get on a littl faster  syme  said bull   never mind the balloon   when i first saw sunday  said syme slowli   i onli saw his back  and when i saw his back  i knew he was the worst man in the world  his neck and shoulder were brutal  like those of some apish god  his head had a stoop that was hard human  like the stoop of an ox  in fact  i had at onc the revolt fanci that this was not a man at all  but a beast dress up in men  s cloth   get on  said dr  bull   and then the queer thing happen  i had seen his back from the street  as he sat in the balconi  then i enter the hotel  and come round the other side of him  saw his face in the sunlight  his face frighten me  as it did everyon  but not becaus it was brutal  not becaus it was evil  on the contrari  it frighten me becaus it was so beauti  becaus it was so good   syme  exclaim the secretari   are you ill   it was like the face of some ancient archangel  judg just after heroic war  there was laughter in the eye  and in the mouth honour and sorrow  there was the same white hair  the same great  grey  clad shoulder that i had seen from behind  but when i saw him from behind i was certain he was an anim  and when i saw him in front i knew he was a god   pan  said the professor dreamili   was a god and an anim   then  and again and alway  went on syme like a man talk to himself   that has been for me the mysteri of sunday  and it is also the mysteri of the world  when i see the horribl back  i am sure the nobl face is but a mask  when i see the face but for an instant  i know the back is onli a jest  bad is so bad  that we cannot but think good an accid  good is so good  that we feel certain that evil could be explain  but the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when i race sunday for the cab  and was just behind him all the way   had you time for think then  ask ratcliff   time  repli syme   for one outrag thought  i was sudden possess with the idea that the blind  blank back of his head realli was his face  an aw  eyeless face stare at me  and i fanci that the figur run in front of me was realli a figur run backward  and danc as he ran   horribl  said dr  bull  and shudder   horribl is not the word  said syme   it was exact the worst instant of my life  and yet ten minut afterward  when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimac like a gargoyl  i knew that he was onli like a father play hide  and  seek with his children   it is a long game  said the secretari  and frown at his broken boot   listen to me  cri syme with extraordinari emphasi   shall i tell you the secret of the whole world  it is that we have onli known the back of the world  we see everyth from behind  and it look brutal  that is not a tree  but the back of a tree  that is not a cloud  but the back of a cloud  cannot you see that everyth is stoop and hide a face  if we could onli get round in front   look  cri out bull clamor   the balloon is come down  there was no need to cri out to syme  who had never taken his eye off it  he saw the great lumin globe sudden stagger in the sky  right itself  and then sink slowli behind the tree like a set sun  the man call gogol  who had hard spoken through all their weari travel  sudden threw up his hand like a lost spirit   he is dead  he cri   and now i know he was my friend  my friend in the dark   dead  snort the secretari   you will not find him dead easili  if he has been tip out of the car  we shall find him roll as a colt roll in a field  kick his leg for fun   clash his hoof  said the professor   the colt do  and so did pan   pan again  said dr  bull irrit   you seem to think pan is everyth   so he is  said the professor   in greek  he mean everyth   don  t forget  said the secretari  look down   that he also mean panic  syme had stood without hear ani of the exclam   it fell over there  he said short   let us follow it  then he ad with an indescrib gestur   oh  if he has cheat us all by get kill  it would be like one of his lark  he strode off toward the distant tree with a new energi  his rag and ribbon flutter in the wind  the other follow him in a more footsor and dubious manner  and almost at the same moment all six men realis that they were not alon in the littl field  across the squar of turf a tall man was advanc toward them  lean on a strang long staff like a sceptr  he was clad in a fine but old  fashion suit with knee  breech  it colour was that shade between blue  violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadow of the woodland  his hair was whitish grey  and at the first glanc  taken along with his knee  breech  look as if it was powder  his advanc was veri quiet  but for the silver frost upon his head  he might have been one to the shadow of the wood   gentlemen  he said   my master has a carriag wait for you in the road just by   who is your master  ask syme  stand quit still   i was told you knew his name  said the man respect  there was a silenc  and then the secretari said   where is this carriag   it has been wait onli a few moment  said the stranger   my master has onli just come home  syme look left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found himself  the hedg were ordinari hedg  the tree seem ordinari tree  yet he felt like a man entrap in fairyland  he look the mysteri ambassador up and down  but he could discov noth except that the man  s coat was the exact colour of the purpl shadow  and that the man  s face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky   show us the place  syme said briefli  and without a word the man in the violet coat turn his back and walk toward a gap in the hedg  which let in sudden the light of a white road  as the six wander broke out upon this thoroughfar  they saw the white road block by what look like a long row of carriag  such a row of carriag as might close the approach to some hous in park lane  along the side of these carriag stood a rank of splendid servant  all dress in the grey  blue uniform  and all have a certain qualiti of stateli and freedom which would not common belong to the servant of a gentleman  but rather to the offici and ambassador of a great king  there were no less than six carriag wait  one for each of the tatter and miser band  all the attend  as if in court  dress  wore sword  and as each man crawl into his carriag they drew them  and salut with a sudden blaze of steel   what can it all mean  ask bull of syme as they separ   is this anoth joke of sunday  s   i don  t know  said syme as he sank wearili back in the cushion of his carriag   but if it is  it  s one of the joke you talk about  it  s a good  natur one  the six adventur had pass through mani adventur  but not one had carri them so utter off their feet as this last adventur of comfort  they had all becom inur to thing go rough  but thing sudden go smooth swamp them  they could not even feebli imagin what the carriag were  it was enough for them to know that they were carriag  and carriag with cushion  they could not conceiv who the old man was who had led them  but it was quit enough that he had certain led them to the carriag  syme drove through a drift dark of tree in utter abandon  it was typic of him that while he had carri his beard chin forward fierc so long as anyth could be done  when the whole busi was taken out of his hand he fell back on the cushion in a frank collaps  veri gradual and veri vagu he realis into what rich road the carriag was carri him  he saw that they pass the stone gate of what might have been a park  that they began gradual to climb a hill which  while wood on both side  was somewhat more order than a forest  then there began to grow upon him  as upon a man slowli wake from a healthi sleep  a pleasur in everyth  he felt that the hedg were what hedg should be  live wall  that a hedg is like a human armi  disciplin  but all the more aliv  he saw high elm behind the hedg  and vagu thought how happi boy would be climb there  then his carriag took a turn of the path  and he saw sudden and quiet  like a long  low  sunset cloud  a long  low hous  mellow in the mild light of sunset  all the six friend compar note afterward and quarrel  but they all agre that in some unaccount way the place remind them of their boyhood  it was either this elm  top or that crook path  it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window  but each man of them declar that he could rememb this place befor he could rememb his mother  when the carriag eventu roll up to a larg  low  cavern gateway  anoth man in the same uniform  but wear a silver star on the grey breast of his coat  came out to meet them  this impress person said to the bewild syme   refresh are provid for you in your room  syme  under the influenc of the same mesmer sleep of amaz  went up the larg oaken stair after the respect attend  he enter a splendid suit of apart that seem to be design special for him  he walk up to a long mirror with the ordinari instinct of his class  to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair  and there he saw the fright figur that he was  blood run down his face from where the bough had struck him  his hair stand out like yellow rag of rank grass  his cloth torn into long  waver tatter  at onc the whole enigma sprang up  simpli as the question of how he had got there  and how he was to get out again  exact at the same moment a man in blue  who had been appoint as his valet  said veri solemn   i have put out your cloth  sir   cloth  said syme sardon   i have no cloth except these  and he lift two long strip of his frock  coat in fascin festoon  and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl   my master ask me to say  said the attend  that there is a fanci dress ball tonight  and that he desir you to put on the costum that i have laid out  meanwhil  sir  there is a bottl of burgundi and some cold pheasant  which he hope you will not refus  as it is some hour befor supper   cold pheasant is a good thing  said syme reflect   and burgundi is a spank good thing  but realli i do not want either of them so much as i want to know what the devil all this mean  and what sort of costum you have got laid out for me  where is it  the servant lift off a kind of ottoman a long peacock  blue draperi  rather of the natur of a domino  on the front of which was emblazon a larg golden sun  and which was splash here and there with flame star and crescent   you  re to be dress as thursday  sir  said the valet somewhat affabl   dress as thursday  said syme in medit   it doesn  t sound a warm costum   oh  yes  sir  said the other eager   the thursday costum is quit warm  sir  it fasten up to the chin   well  i don  t understand anyth  said syme  sigh   i have been use so long to uncomfort adventur that comfort adventur knock me out  still  i may be allow to ask whi i should be particular like thursday in a green frock spot all over with the sun and moon  those orb  i think  shine on other day  i onc saw the moon on tuesday  i rememb   beg pardon  sir  said the valet   bibl also provid for you  and with a respect and rigid finger he point out a passag in the first chapter of genesi  syme read it wonder  it was that in which the fourth day of the week is associ with the creation of the sun and moon  here  howev  they reckon from a christian sunday   this is get wilder and wilder  said syme  as he sat down in a chair   who are these peopl who provid cold pheasant and burgundi  and green cloth and bibl  do they provid everyth   yes  sir  everyth  said the attend grave   shall i help you on with your costum   oh  hitch the balli thing on  said syme impati  but though he affect to despis the mummeri  he felt a curious freedom and natur in his movement as the blue and gold garment fell about him  and when he found that he had to wear a sword  it stir a boyish dream  as he pass out of the room he flung the fold across his shoulder with a gestur  his sword stood out at an angl  and he had all the swagger of a troubadour  for these disguis did not disguis  but reveal  chapter xv the accus as syme strode along the corridor he saw the secretari stand at the top of a great flight of stair  the man had never look so nobl  he was drape in a long robe of starless black  down the centr of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white  like a singl shaft of light  the whole look like some veri sever ecclesiast vestment  there was no need for syme to search his memori or the bibl in order to rememb that the first day of creation mark the mere creation of light out of dark  the vestment itself would alon have suggest the symbol  and syme felt also how perfect this pattern of pure white and black express the soul of the pale and auster secretari  with his inhuman verac and his cold frenzi  which made him so easili make war on the anarchist  and yet so easili pass for one of them  syme was scarc surpris to notic that  amid all the eas and hospit of their new surround  this man  s eye were still stern  no smell of ale or orchard could make the secretari ceas to ask a reason question  if syme had been abl to see himself  he would have realis that he  too  seem to be for the first time himself and no one els  for if the secretari stood for that philosoph who love the origin and formless light  syme was a type of the poet who seek alway to make the light in special shape  to split it up into sun and star  the philosoph may sometim love the infinit  the poet alway love the finit  for him the great moment is not the creation of light  but the creation of the sun and moon  as they descend the broad stair togeth they overtook ratcliff  who was clad in spring green like a huntsman  and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangl of tree  for he stood for that third day on which the earth and green thing were made  and his squar  sensibl face  with it not unfriend cynic  seem appropri enough to it  they were led out of anoth broad and low gateway into a veri larg old english garden  full of torch and bonfir  by the broken light of which a vast carniv of peopl were danc in motley dress  syme seem to see everi shape in natur imit in some crazi costum  there was a man dress as a windmil with enorm sail  a man dress as an eleph  a man dress as a balloon  the two last  togeth  seem to keep the thread of their farcic adventur  syme even saw  with a queer thrill  one dancer dress like an enorm hornbil  with a beak twice as big as himself  the queer bird which had fix itself on his fanci like a live question while he was rush down the long road at the zoolog garden  there were a thousand other such object  howev  there was a danc lamp  post  a danc appl tree  a danc ship  one would have thought that the untam tune of some mad musician had set all the common object of field and street danc an etern jig  and long afterward  when syme was middl  age and at rest  he could never see one of those particular object  a lamppost  or an appl tree  or a windmil  without think that it was a stray revel from that revel of masquerad  on one side of this lawn  aliv with dancer  was a sort of green bank  like the terrac in such old  fashion garden  along this  in a kind of crescent  stood seven great chair  the throne of the seven day  gogol and dr  bull were alreadi in their seat  the professor was just mount to his  gogol  or tuesday  had his simplic well symbolis by a dress design upon the divis of the water  a dress that separ upon his forehead and fell to his feet  grey and silver  like a sheet of rain  the professor  whose day was that on which the bird and fish  the ruder form of life  were creat  had a dress of dim purpl  over which sprawl goggl  eye fish and outrag tropic bird  the union in him of unfathom fanci and of doubt  dr  bull  the last day of creation  wore a coat cover with herald anim in red and gold  and on his crest a man rampant  he lay back in his chair with a broad smile  the pictur of an optimist in his element  one by one the wander ascend the bank and sat in their strang seat  as each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carniv  such as that with which crowd receiv king  cup were clash and torch shaken  and feather hat flung in the air  the men for whom these throne were reserv were men crown with some extraordinari laurel  but the central chair was empti  syme was on the left hand of it and the secretari on the right  the secretari look across the empti throne at syme  and said  compress his lip   we do not know yet that he is not dead in a field  almost as syme heard the word  he saw on the sea of human face in front of him a fright and beauti alter  as if heaven had open behind his head  but sunday had onli pass silent along the front like a shadow  and had sat in the central seat  he was drape plain  in a pure and terribl white  and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead  for a long time  it seem for hour  that huge masquerad of mankind sway and stamp in front of them to march and exult music  everi coupl danc seem a separ romanc  it might be a fairi danc with a pillar  box  or a peasant girl danc with the moon  but in each case it was  somehow  as absurd as alic in wonderland  yet as grave and kind as a love stori  at last  howev  the thick crowd began to thin itself  coupl stroll away into the garden  walk  or began to drift toward that end of the build where stood smoke  in huge pot like fish  kettl  some hot and scent mixtur of old ale or wine  abov all these  upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the hous  roar in it iron basket a gigant bonfir  which lit up the land for mile  it flung the home effect of firelight over the face of vast forest of grey or brown  and it seem to fill with warmth even the empti of upper night  yet this also  after a time  was allow to grow fainter  the dim group gather more and more round the great cauldron  or pass  laugh and clatter  into the inner passag of that ancient hous  soon there were onli some ten loiter in the garden  soon onli four  final the last stray merri  maker ran into the hous whoop to his companion  the fire fade  and the slow  strong star came out  and the seven strang men were left alon  like seven stone statu on their chair of stone  not one of them had spoken a word  they seem in no hast to do so  but heard in silenc the hum of insect and the distant song of one bird  then sunday spoke  but so dreamili that he might have been continu a convers rather than begin one   we will eat and drink later  he said   let us remain togeth a littl  we who have love each other so sad  and have fought so long  i seem to rememb onli centuri of heroic war  in which you were alway hero  epic on epic  iliad on iliad  and you alway brother in arm  whether it was but recent  for time is noth  or at the begin of the world  i sent you out to war  i sat in the dark  where there is not ani creat thing  and to you i was onli a voic command valour and an unnatur virtu  you heard the voic in the dark  and you never heard it again  the sun in heaven deni it  the earth and sky deni it  all human wisdom deni it  and when i met you in the daylight i deni it myself  syme stir sharpli in his seat  but otherwis there was silenc  and the incomprehens went on   but you were men  you did not forget your secret honour  though the whole cosmos turn an engin of tortur to tear it out of you  i knew how near you were to hell  i know how you  thursday  cross sword with king satan  and how you  wednesday  name me in the hour without hope  there was complet silenc in the starlit garden  and then the black  brow secretari  implac  turn in his chair toward sunday  and said in a harsh voic   who and what are you   i am the sabbath  said the other without move   i am the peac of god  the secretari start up  and stood crush his cost robe in his hand   i know what you mean  he cri   and it is exact that that i cannot forgiv you  i know you are content  optim  what do they call the thing  an ultim reconcili  well  i am not reconcil  if you were the man in the dark room  whi were you also sunday  an offens to the sunlight  if you were from the first our father and our friend  whi were you also our greatest enemi  we wept  we fled in terror  the iron enter into our soul  and you are the peac of god  oh  i can forgiv god his anger  though it destroy nation  but i cannot forgiv him his peac  sunday answer not a word  but veri slowli he turn his face of stone upon syme as if ask a question   no  said syme   i do not feel fierc like that  i am grate to you  not onli for wine and hospit here  but for mani a fine scamper and free fight  but i should like to know  my soul and heart are as happi and quiet here as this old garden  but my reason is still cri out  i should like to know  sunday look at ratcliff  whose clear voic said   it seem so silli that you should have been on both side and fought yourself  bull said   l understand noth  but i am happi  in fact  i am go to sleep   i am not happi  said the professor with his head in his hand   becaus i do not understand  you let me stray a littl too near to hell  and then gogol said  with the absolut simplic of a child   i wish i knew whi i was hurt so much  still sunday said noth  but onli sat with his mighti chin upon his hand  and gaze at the distanc  then at last he said   i have heard your complaint in order  and here  i think  come anoth to complain  and we will hear him also  the fall fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam  like a bar of burn gold  across the dim grass  against this fieri band was outlin in utter black the advanc leg of a black  clad figur  he seem to have a fine close suit with knee  breech such as that which was worn by the servant of the hous  onli that it was not blue  but of this absolut sabl  he had  like the servant  a kind of word by his side  it was onli when he had come quit close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them  that syme saw  with thunder  struck clear  that the face was the broad  almost ape  like face of his old friend gregori  with it rank red hair and it insult smile   gregori  gasp syme  half  rise from his seat   whi  this is the real anarchist   yes  said gregori  with a great and danger restraint   i am the real anarchist   now there was a day  murmur bull  who seem realli to have fallen asleep   when the son of god came to present themselv befor the lord  and satan came also among them   you are right  said gregori  and gaze all round   i am a destroy  i would destroy the world if i could  a sens of a patho far under the earth stir up in syme  and he spoke broken and without sequenc   oh  most unhappi man  he cri   tri to be happi  you have red hair like your sister   my red hair  like red flame  shall burn up the world  said gregori   i thought i hate everyth more than common men can hate anyth  but i find that i do not hate everyth so much as i hate you    i never hate you  said syme veri sad  then out of this unintellig creatur the last thunder broke   you  he cri   you never hate becaus you never live  i know what you are all of you  from first to last  you are the peopl in power  you are the polic  the great fat  smile men in blue and button  you are the law  and you have never been broken  but is there a free soul aliv that doe not long to break you  onli becaus you have never been broken  we in revolt talk all kind of nonsens doubtless about this crime or that crime of the govern  it is all folli  the onli crime of the govern is that it govern  the unpardon sin of the suprem power is that it is suprem  i do not curs you for be cruel  i do not curs you  though i might  for be kind  i curs you for be safe  you sit in your chair of stone  and have never come down from them  you are the seven angel of heaven  and you have had no troubl  oh  i could forgiv you everyth  you that rule all mankind  if i could feel for onc that you had suffer for one hour a real agoni such as i  syme sprang to his feet  shake from head to foot   i see everyth  he cri   everyth that there is  whi doe each thing on the earth war against each other thing  whi doe each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself  whi doe a fli have to fight the whole univers  whi doe a dandelion have to fight the whole univers  for the same reason that i had to be alon in the dread council of the day  so that each thing that obey law may have the glori and isol of the anarchist  so that each man fight for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamit  so that the real lie of satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphem  so that by tear and tortur we may earn the right to say to this man   you lie  no agoni can be too great to buy the right to say to this accus   we also have suffer   it is not true that we have never been broken  we have been broken upon the wheel  it is not true that we have never descend from these throne  we have descend into hell  we were complain of unforgett miseri even at the veri moment when this man enter insol to accus us of happi  i repel the slander  we have not been happi  i can answer for everi one of the great guard of law whom he has accus  at least  he had turn his eye so as to see sudden the great face of sunday  which wore a strang smile   have you  he cri in a dread voic   have you ever suffer  as he gaze  the great face grew to an aw size  grew larger than the coloss mask of memnon  which had made him scream as a child  it grew larger and larger  fill the whole sky  then everyth went black  onli in the black befor it entir destroy his brain he seem to hear a distant voic say a commonplac text that he had heard somewher   can ye drink of the cup that i drink of     when men in book awak from a vision  they common find themselv in some place in which they might have fallen asleep  they yawn in a chair  or lift themselv with bruis limb from a field  syme  s experi was someth much more psycholog strang if there was inde anyth unreal  in the earth sens  about the thing he had gone through  for while he could alway rememb afterward that he had swoon befor the face of sunday  he could not rememb have ever come to at all  he could onli rememb that gradual and natur he knew that he was and had been walk along a countri lane with an easi and convers companion  that companion had been a part of his recent drama  it was the red  hair poet gregori  they were walk like old friend  and were in the middl of a convers about some trivial  but syme could onli feel an unnatur buoyanc in his bodi and a crystal simplic in his mind that seem to be superior to everyth that he said or did  he felt he was in possess of some imposs good news  which made everi other thing a trivial  but an ador trivial  dawn was break over everyth in colour at onc clear and timid  as if natur made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose  a breez blew so clean and sweet  that one could not think that it blew from the sky  it blew rather through some hole in the sky  syme felt a simpl surpris when he saw rise all round him on both side of the road the red  irregular build of saffron park  he had no idea that he had walk so near london  he walk by instinct along one white road  on which earli bird hop and sang  and found himself outsid a fenc garden  there he saw the sister of gregori  the girl with the gold  red hair  cut lilac befor breakfast  with the great unconsci graviti of a girl
